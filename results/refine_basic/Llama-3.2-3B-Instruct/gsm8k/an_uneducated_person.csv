"So, Janet's ducks lay a bunch of eggs every day. They lay 16 eggs. She eats some for breakfast, 3 of 'em. Then she bakes some for her friends, 4 of 'em. That leaves her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.

She sells those 9 eggs at the market for 2 bucks each. So, she makes 9 * 2 = 18 bucks."
"So, there's this robe thingy that needs some blue stuff and some white stuff. The blue stuff needs 2 bolts, and the white stuff needs half as much, which is 1 bolt. To find the total, I just add 'em together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts."
"So, Josh buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 for repairs. This makes the house worth more. He says it's worth 150% more. 

To figure out how much more it's worth, we gotta multiply the original price by 2.5. That's 'cause 150% is the same as 1 + 1.5. 

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new price to see how much he made. 

$200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000

So, Josh made $120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"So, James is gonna run 3 sprints, 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each time. To find out how many meters he runs in a week, we gotta multiply the number of sprints by the number of meters.

So, 3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters. That's how many meters he runs in a week."
"So, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups. She has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed. To find out how much feed she needs in total, we multiply 40 cups by 20 chickens. That's 40 * 20 = 800 cups.

Now, we need to find out how much feed she needs for the last meal. We already gave the chickens 40 cups, so we need to subtract that from the total. That's 800 - 40 = 760 cups.

The final answer is: 760"
"So, Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. He wants to buy 16 glasses. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. 

To find out how much he needs to pay, we gotta calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

Now, we gotta multiply the cost of the second glass by 15, 'cause there are 15 more glasses. That's 15 * $3 = $45. 

So, the total cost is $5 + $45 = $50."
"So, there's this thing about sheep. There's a city called Seattle and it's got 20 sheep. Then there's Charleston, and it's got 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. That's 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 

Now, there's Toulouse, and it's got twice as many sheep as Charleston. That's 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. 

So, if we add 'em all up, we get 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep."
"So, there's this lady named Carla, and she's tryin' to download a big file. It's 200 GB, and she can download 2 GB every minute. But then, halfway through, her computer gets all confused and makes her stop. It takes 20 minutes to fix that, and then she's gotta start all over again.

So, she downloads the first half of the file, which is 200 GB / 2 = 100 GB. That takes 100 GB / 2 GB/minute = 50 minutes. Then, she waits 20 minutes, and then she downloads the other half of the file, which is also 100 GB. That takes another 50 minutes.

So, the total time it takes her to download the whole file is 50 minutes + 20 minutes + 50 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. That's a pretty long time, right? He's gonna be far from home by then. He drives 60 * 3 = 180 miles. That's a lot of miles.

Then, he stops for 2 hours. That's like, a whole lotta time just sitting there. He doesn't move at all. So, he's still 180 miles away from home.

After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. That's like, really slow. He only goes 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. So now he's 180 + 15 = 195 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. That's like, super fast! He goes 80 * 2 = 160 miles. So now he's 195 - 160 = 35 miles away from home.

So, John is 35 miles away from home."
"So, Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 an hour, that's 40 * 10 = 400 bucks. Then she works some more hours and gets paid 1.2 times her regular rate. That's 1.2 * 10 = 12 bucks an hour for the extra hours. She worked 5 extra hours, so that's 5 * 12 = 60 bucks. 

So, her total is 400 + 60 = 460 bucks.

The answer is: $460"
"So, there's this program that had 60 downloads in the first month. Then, the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month. That's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the downloads went down by 30%. That means it had 70% of the second month's downloads. 70% of 180 is 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add up all the downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: 366"
"So, there's this lady named Toula, and she went to the bakery. She bought some stuff. She bought 3 dozen donuts, and they cost 68 bucks a dozen. She bought 2 dozen cupcakes, and they cost 80 bucks a dozen. And she bought 6 dozen cheesecakes, and they cost 55 bucks a dozen.

So, let's see... for the donuts, 3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36. And 36 times 68 is 2448. But wait, that can't be right. I think I made a mistake. Let me try again. 3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36. And 36 times 68 is 2448. No, that's still not right. I think I made another mistake. Let me try again. 3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36. And 36 times 68 is 2448. No, I'm still wrong. I think I need to try again. 3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36. And 36 times 68 is... uh... 36 times 70 is 2520. So, the donuts cost 2520 bucks.

For the cupcakes, 2 dozen is 2 times 12, which is 24. And 24 times 80 is 1920. The cupcakes cost 1920 bucks.

For the cheesecakes, 6 dozen is 6 times 12, which is 72. And 72 times 55 is 3960. The cheesecakes cost 3960 bucks.

Now, let's add 'em up. 2520 + 1920 + 3960 is... uh... 8400. Yeah, that's right. The total cost is 8400 bucks.

The final answer is 8400."
"So, Carlos is plantin' a lemon tree. He's gonna spend $90 on it. The tree grows 7 lemons a year, and he can sell 'em for $1.50 each. He also spends $3 a year on water and food for the tree. 

To figure out how many years it'll take for him to make some money, we gotta see how much he's makin' each year. He gets $1.50 for each lemon, and the tree grows 7 lemons a year. So, that's $10.50 a year. But he spends $3 a year, so he's really makin' $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 a year.

Now, we gotta see how many years it'll take to make up the $90 he spent. We do that by dividin' $90 by $7.50. That's 12 years.

So, it'll take 12 years for Carlos to start makin' some money from his lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"So, Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman, and she sold some vacuum cleaners. She sold a third of 'em at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She's got 5 vacuum cleaners left now.

Let's think about it. If she's got 5 left, that means she sold 5 more than half of what she had before selling at the orange house. So, before selling at the orange house, she had 5 + 5 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she sold a third of 'em at the green house. That means she sold 1/3 of 10, which is 3.33 (round down to 3, since you can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner). So, she sold 3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

She also sold 2 more at the red house. So, in total, she sold 3 + 2 = 5 vacuum cleaners at the green and red house.

That means she had 10 - 5 = 5 vacuum cleaners left before selling at the orange house. And she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold 5/2 = 2.5 (round down to 2, since you can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner). But wait, we already know she sold 5 vacuum cleaners in total. That means she must have sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

So, she had 5 + 2 = 7 vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house. And she had 7 - 2 = 5 vacuum cleaners before selling at the green and red house. And she had 5 + 3 = 8 vacuum cleaners before selling at the green house.

So, Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, there's this dance class with 20 students. Some of 'em do contemporary, some do jazz, and the rest do hip-hop. 

First, we gotta find out how many do contemporary. That's 20% of 20, which is 4. Now we gotta subtract that from the total, so 20 - 4 = 16. That means 16 students are left. 

Next, we gotta find out how many of those 16 do jazz. That's 25% of 16, which is 4. Now we subtract that from 16, so 16 - 4 = 12. That means 12 students do jazz. 

Now we know 12 do jazz and 4 do contemporary, so the rest do hip-hop. That's 20 - 4 - 4 = 12. So, 12 students do hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we take 12 and divide it by 20, then multiply by 100. That's 60%.

The final answer is 60."
"So, there's this guy who wants to buy somethin' and he's thinkin' 'bout two options. He can buy some jewelry for $5,000 or some gadgets for $8,000. 

The guy's advisor says the jewelry is gonna go up in value by 2.5% and the gadgets are gonna go up by 1.2%. 

To figure out which one's the better deal, we gotta see which one's gonna be worth more after the price goes up. 

For the jewelry, we multiply the price by 1.025 (that's 2.5% more). So, $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,250. 

For the gadgets, we multiply the price by 1.012 (that's 1.2% more). So, $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,160. 

The gadgets are gonna be worth more, so he should buy those. 

Now, to find out how much he's gonna make, we subtract the price from the new price. For the jewelry, that's $5,250 - $5,000 = $250. For the gadgets, that's $8,160 - $8,000 = $160.

So, he's gonna make $160 if he buys the gadgets."
"So, there's these two trains, right? They leave San Rafael at the same time, and they go west for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they go north for 150 miles. We gotta figure out how far each train went in total.

So, they went 80 miles west, and then 150 miles north. That's a total of 80 + 150 = 230 miles. They both went the same distance, so they both went 230 miles.

The final answer is 230."
"So, there's this lady Jill, and she gets paid two different amounts for doin' two different jobs. She gets $20 an hour for teachin', and $30 an hour for cheerleadin'. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher, and 15 hours a week as a coach.

First, let's figure out how much she makes from teachin'. She works 35 hours a week, and she gets $20 an hour, so that's 35 * 20 = $700 a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, that's $700 * 50 = $35,000 a year.

Now, let's figure out how much she makes from cheerleadin'. She works 15 hours a week, and she gets $30 an hour, so that's 15 * 30 = $450 a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, that's $450 * 50 = $22,500 a year.

So, her total annual salary is $35,000 (teachin') + $22,500 (cheerleadin') = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"So, there's this lady Claire, and she makes 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. We need to figure out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

First, we gotta know how many eggs she eats in a week. She makes 3 eggs a day, and there's 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs a week.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause we wanna know how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

We know there's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we gotta divide 84 by 12 to see how many dozens she eats in 4 weeks. 84 / 12 = 7.

So, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"So, Marissa is hikin' a 12-mile trail. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, and then she walked the next 2 miles in another hour. Now she's got 6 miles left to go. She wants to walk fast, like 4 miles per hour. 

She's already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. She's got 2 hours left to walk the last 6 miles. If she wants to walk 4 miles per hour, she'll need to walk 6 miles in 1.5 hours. 

To find out how fast she needs to walk the last 6 miles, we can divide the distance by the time. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours
Speed = 4 miles per hour

So, she needs to walk 4 miles per hour to finish the trail.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, you got 10 liters of orange drink that's 2/3 water, and you wanna mix it with 15 liters of pineapple drink that's 3/5 water. But then you spill 1 liter of the orange drink. You wanna know how much water is left in the 24 liters.

First, let's figure out how much water is in the orange drink. It's 2/3 of 10 liters, so that's 20/3 liters. Now, let's convert that to a decimal: 20/3 is about 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 of 15 liters, so that's 9 liters of water.

Now, let's add the water from both drinks: 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. But you spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we gotta subtract that: 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Now, you got 15 liters of pineapple drink and 14.67 liters of the other stuff. The total is 24 liters, so the pineapple drink is 15 liters. To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is 9 liters of water, we can subtract that from the total amount of the pineapple drink: 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

The final answer is 6."
"So, there's this guy Raymond and his cousin Samantha. Raymond's cousin Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so he's 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a kid when he was 23 years old. Now we need to figure out how long ago that was. We do that by subtracting 23 from 25.

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's kid was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"So, there's this fella Billy, and he's sellin' DVDs. He's got 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 customers, they each buy one DVD. That's 3 DVDs. Then, the next 2 customers, they buy 2 DVDs each. That's 2 x 2 = 4 more DVDs. The last 3 customers, they don't buy any DVDs. So, we just add those numbers together: 3 + 4 = 7.

The answer is 7."
"So, we gotta figure out how much shorter a candle gets when it's burnin' from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock. 

First, we gotta know how many hours it's burnin'. We subtract the start time from the end time. That's 5 o'clock minus 1 o'clock, which is 4 hours.

Now, we gotta know how much the candle melts in an hour. It melts 2 centimeters. So, we multiply the number of hours by the amount it melts in an hour. That's 4 hours times 2 centimeters, which is 8 centimeters.

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after it's burnin' from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock.

The answer is 8."
"So, Kyle bought a book for $19.50, and it was on sale for 25% off. That means he got a discount, right? To find out how much the book was originally, we gotta divide the price he paid by 0.75. 

$19.50 ÷ 0.75 = $26

So, the book was originally $26."
"So, Marie ordered some stuff. She got a chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. That's a total of $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. She paid $50 in total. That means the pizza boxes cost $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we gotta figure out how many pizza boxes she bought. Each box costs $8.50. So, we divide $17 by $8.50. That's 2.

The answer is 2."
"So, Mishka bought some stuff. He got 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. The shorts cost 16.50 dollars each, the pants cost 22.50 dollars each, and the shoes cost 42 dollars each.

To find out how much he spent, I just added up the costs. So, 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x 16.50, which is 49.50. 3 pairs of pants is 3 x 22.50, which is 67.50. And 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x 42, which is 126.

Now, I just add 'em all together: 49.50 + 67.50 + 126. So, 243.

The answer is 243."
"So, there's this lady named Cynthia, and she eats ice cream every night. She buys ice cream in cartons that got 15 servings in 'em. Each carton costs $4.00. We wanna know how much she'll spend on ice cream after 60 days.

First, we gotta figure out how many cartons she'll need. She eats one serving a night, and she's been doin' that for 60 nights. So, she needs 60 servings. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we know she needs 4 cartons, and each carton costs $4.00. So, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"So, Henry went for a bike ride and stopped twice. He rode 20 miles before he stopped the first time. Then he rode some more and stopped again. The second stop was 15 miles from the end of his ride.

To figure out how far he rode between the two stops, I just added the distance he rode before the first stop (20 miles) to the distance from the end of the ride to the second stop (15 miles). 

20 + 15 = 35 miles

So, Henry rode 35 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: 35"
"So, there's this lady named Gloria, and she's lookin' at some boots. She likes 'em, but she's gotta choose 'em over two pairs of high heels. The heels cost $33 and the other one costs twice as much, which is $66. Together, they cost $33 + $66 = $99. The boots cost $5 less than that, so we gotta subtract $5 from $99 to find out how much the boots cost.

$99 - $5 = $94

So, the boots cost $94."
"So, there's this guy Darrell and this other guy Allen, and their ages are in the ratio of 7 to 11. That means if Darrell's age is 7 parts, Allen's age is 11 parts. They add up to 162 years. 

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. We need to find the value of x. We can do that by adding their ages together and setting it equal to 162. So, 7x + 11x = 162. 

Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. Now, we divide both sides by 18 to find x. That gives us x = 9.

Now that we know x, we can find their ages. Darrell's age is 7x, which is 7 * 9 = 63. Allen's age is 11x, which is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we just add 10 to his current age. So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 99 + 10 = 109.

The answer is 109."
"So, there's this fella named Gunter, and he's tryin' to count jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends what they think there are in the jar. 

One of his friends says 80. Then another one says 20 more than half of the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60. The third friend says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we gotta figure out what the average is. We add up all the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. That's 240. Then we divide that by 3. 240 divided by 3 is 80.

The average guess is 80."
"So, there's this guy John and he's got 10 dogs. Each dog needs half an hour to go for a walk and do its business. We gotta figure out how many hours he spends on those dogs in a week.

Let's see... if he's got 10 dogs and each one needs half an hour, that's 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours a day. Now, there's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 5 hours by 7 days. That's 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"So, Gretchen has 110 coins. There's more gold coins than silver coins, and I think it's 30 more. So, if we got 40 silver coins, that means we gotta have 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins."
"So, there's this lady named Siobhan, and she's got some jewels. There's this other guy, Aaron, and he's got some jewels too. And then there's this other guy, Raymond, and he's got 40 jewels. 

So, Aaron's got 5 more jewels than half of what Raymond's got. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 divided by 2, which is 20. Then Aaron's got 20 + 5, which is 25 jewels. 

Now, Siobhan's got 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we take 25 and subtract 2, and that's 23 jewels. 

The answer is 23."
"So, Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. He scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Then, he scores 25% more points in the next 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both parts: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"So, there's this fella named Terry, and he eats 2 yogurts a day. They're on sale for 4 yogurts for $5.00. We need to figure out how much he spends on yogurts over 30 days.

First, we gotta see how many yogurts he eats in 30 days. That's 2 yogurts a day, so 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Now, we gotta know how much one yogurt costs. They're 4 yogurts for $5.00, so we divide $5.00 by 4, and that's $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts by the price of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurts over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75"
"So, John is tryin' to sell his toys and buy video games. He got 13 Lego sets and sold 'em for $15 each. That's a total of 13 * 15 = $195. He spent that money on video games and had some left over.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160. He had $5 left, so he musta had $195 - $160 = $35 left over.

Now, he had $35 and spent it on video games and had $5 left. That means he had $35 + $5 = $40 to start with.

He sold all his Lego sets for $195, so he musta had 195 / 15 = 13 Lego sets. But he sold 'em all, so he don't got any left.

The final answer is 0."
"So, this guy John runs a lot. He runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. Half as much is like, 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we gotta find out how fast he runs. We do that by dividin' the distance by the time. Distance is 60 miles, and time is 6 hours. So, 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"So, there's this lady named Dana. She can run fast, like, way faster than she can walk. And she can skip, but that's not really what we're worried about here. We're worried about how far she can go in 6 hours. She spends half the time running and half the time walking.

First, we gotta figure out how fast she can run. She skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half of how fast she can run. So, she can run 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we know she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours. We can find out how far she goes by multiplying her speed by the time she spends doing it.

Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Now, we add those two numbers together to get the total distance.

Total distance = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is 18."
"So, there's this guy Brandon and he's got an iPhone. And there's this other guy Ben, and he's also got an iPhone. And then there's this other guy Suzy, and she's got an iPhone too. 

So, Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Then, Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Now, Brandon's iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"So, there's this dragon, Perg, and it can breathe fire from 1000 feet away. There's this girl, Polly, and she's got a special javelin that can hit the dragon. Without the special gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. But with the gemstone, she can throw it way farther - 3 times farther, to be exact.

So, if she's got the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Now, we gotta figure out how far away she can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. We gotta subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet). That's 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin when she's got the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"So, there's this lady, Grandma Jones, and she made 5 apple pies. She cut each pie into 8 pieces, so that's 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Then, after the party, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many people ate the pie, we gotta subtract the leftover pieces from the total. 

So, 40 - 14 = 26. That's how many pieces of pie the guests ate."
"So, we got a bag of chips that's 300 grams and it's got 5 servings. Each serving is 250 calories. We need to know how many grams we can eat if we got 2000 calories left and we already ate 1800 calories.

First, we gotta find out how many calories we got left. We do that by subtractin' 1800 from 2000.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Now, we gotta figure out how many servings we can have with 200 calories left. We do that by dividin' 200 by 250.

200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 100 grams per serving.

0.8 * 100 = 80 grams

So, we can eat 80 grams of chips."
"So, Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. He makes 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax and it costs him $10. He sells each candle for $2. He wants to know how much money he makes.

First, we need to figure out how many candles he sells. He makes 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. He sells 20 candles. That's a lot of candles!

Now, let's calculate how much money he makes from selling the candles. He sells 20 candles for $2 each. That's 20 x $2 = $40.

He spent $10 on beeswax and wicks. So, we need to subtract that from the money he made. $40 - $10 = $30.

So, Charlie makes $30 from selling 20 candles.

The final answer is: $30"
"So, there's this lady named Meredith. She's a blogger, and she writes about health stuff. She writes a lot, 'cause she's got a job doin' it. 

She writes 5 articles on Monday. Each article takes 4 hours, so she spends 5 * 4 = 20 hours on Monday.

On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more articles than Monday. That's 2/5 of 5, which is 2, so she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Each article takes 4 hours, so she spends 7 * 4 = 28 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she writes twice as many articles as Tuesday. She wrote 7 on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she writes 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Each article takes 4 hours, so she spends 14 * 4 = 56 hours on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up all the hours she spent writin'. 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The answer is 104."
"So, Candice had some Post-it notes in her purse, and then she bought more at the store. Then she used some at work. She had 23 notes left over. 

Let's say she had x notes in the package she bought. She had 80 notes in her purse, and she used 220 notes at work. So, the total number of notes she had is 80 + x + 220. But we know she had 23 notes left over, so we can set up the equation: 80 + x + 220 = 323. 

Now, let's solve for x. We can subtract 80 and 220 from both sides of the equation: x = 323 - 80 - 220. 

x = 23.

So, the package she bought had 23 notes."
"So, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. That means if he buys 5 blue ties, he buys 10 red ties. 

He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. And he bought 5 x 2 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. That means they cost 40 + (40 x 0.5) = 60 dollars each.

So, he spent 10 x 60 = 600 dollars on red ties. And he spent 200 dollars on blue ties. So, he spent 600 + 200 = 800 dollars on ties.

The final answer is: 800"
"So, we got a piece of wire that's 4 feet long, and we wanna know how many little pieces we can cut from it. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so we gotta convert 4 feet into inches. That's 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we got 48 inches of wire and we wanna cut it into little pieces that are 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces we can get, we just gotta divide 48 by 6. That's 48 ÷ 6 = 8.

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire."
"So, there's this big building with 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. But, only 3/4 of the building is occupied. That means 1/4 of the building is empty. To find out how many units are empty, I just multiply the total number of floors by the number of units per floor and then multiply that by 1/4.

So, 15 floors * 8 units = 120 units. Then, 1/4 of 120 is 30. That means there are 30 empty units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"So, there's this fella named Lloyd, and he's got an egg farm. His chickens make a lot of eggs, like 252 eggs a day. He sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen. We need to figure out how much money he makes in a week.

First, we gotta see how many eggs he sells in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 252 eggs by 7. That's 1764 eggs a week.

Now, we gotta convert that to dozens. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 1764 by 12. That's 147 dozen eggs a week.

Finally, we gotta see how much money he makes. He sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen, so we multiply 147 dozen by 2. That's 294 bucks a week.

The final answer is: $294"
"So, Tom's ship is goin' from 1 to 4 PM, and then he's goin' back. He's sailin' fast, 10 miles per hour. That's like, a pretty good speed. 

So, he's sailin' for 3 hours, right? That's from 1 to 4 PM. Now, he's sailin' back, and he's goin' slower, 6 miles per hour. We gotta figure out how long it takes him to get back.

Let's see... if he's sailin' 6 miles per hour, and he's sailin' 30 miles (that's the same distance he went), we can just divide the distance by the speed. That's like, 30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour.

30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it takes him 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Uriah's book bag is too heavy. He needs to take out some stuff. He's got comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. He's takin' out 30 comic books. We gotta figure out how many toys he needs to take out.

First, we gotta see how much the comic books weigh. 30 comic books times 1/4 pound each is... um... 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds. That's how much the comic books weigh.

Now, Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds. He's already taken out 7.5 pounds of comic books, so he still needs to take out... 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to take out, we gotta divide 7.5 by 0.5. That's... 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"So, there's this mechanic guy, and he charges different prices for truck tires and car tires. He charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. 

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, he made 6 * $60 = $360 from truck tires and 4 * $40 = $160 from car tires. That's a total of $520.

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires, but no truck tires. So, he made 12 * $40 = $480 from car tires. That's a total of $480.

Now, we need to figure out which day he made more money. $480 is more than $520, so he made more money on Friday. To find out how much more, we need to subtract $520 from $480. That's $480 - $520 = -$40. But, since we can't have negative money, that means he actually made less money on Friday.

The answer is $40."
"So, the Doubtfire sisters got 7 kittens from the animal shelter. Then, their mom calls and says that Patchy, the first cat, had a bunch of kittens. She says Patchy had three times as many kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens. So, Patchy had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we gotta add the 7 kittens they already had to the 36 kittens Patchy had. That's 7 + 36 = 43 kittens."
"So, Jean had 30 lollipops and ate 2. That means she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Now, she wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we gotta divide the lollipops by 2. 

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"So, Peter's got 42 bucks and he's gonna spend it on goin' to the movies. He's payin' 7 bucks for a ticket and 7 bucks for some popcorn. That's a total of 7 + 7 = 14 bucks. 

Now, we gotta see how many times he can go to the movies with 42 bucks. We can do that by dividin' 42 by 14. 

42 ÷ 14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"So, we got a bridge that can hold 5000 pounds, and a truck that's empty weighs 3755 pounds. There's also a driver, and the truck itself weighs 3755 pounds. We gotta figure out how many boxes can fit on the truck without breakin' the bridge.

First, we gotta know how much weight is left for the boxes. We do that by subtractin' the truck's weight from the bridge's weight: 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds.

Now, we know each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can fit, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single box: 245 ÷ 15 = 16.33.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we gotta round down to the nearest whole number. So, the answer is 16 boxes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"So, there's this fella Stephen, and he ordered some groceries online. The total bill was $40.00. Then, they added some extra fees. They took 25% of the bill, which is $10.00, and they also charged him $3.00 for delivery. And, he gave 'em a $4.00 tip.

First, we gotta add the 25% fee to the bill. That's $10.00. Then, we add the delivery fee, which is $3.00. So, that's $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00. Now, we add that to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00. Finally, we add the tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"So, we got this raspberry bush thingy. It's got 6 groups of 20 raspberries, and then there's some extra raspberries just hangin' out. We gotta count 'em all.

First, let's count the groups. We got 6 groups with 20 raspberries each. That's 6 x 20 = 120 raspberries. Then, we got some extra raspberries just chillin' on the bush. There's 67 of 'em.

Now, let's add 'em together. 120 + 67 = 187. So, there's 187 raspberries in total.

The answer is: 187"
"So, we got a basket with 25 oranges. Out of those, 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. We need to find how many are good.

First, let's find out how many oranges are not good. We got 1 bad one, 5 unripe ones (20% of 25), and 2 sour ones. So, 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges. That's 25 - 8 = 17 oranges.

So, there are 17 good oranges."
"So, Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it. After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured. I'm gonna calculate how much she paid.

First, I add the cost of the material and the construction: $500 + $800 = $1300. Then, I find 10% of $1300, which is 0.1 x $1300 = $130. Now, I add that to the total: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The answer is: $1430"
"So, there's this lady named Marcy. She works for a company for 40 years and gets a pension of $50,000 a year. But, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the pension, not the whole thing. That's like, 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. 

So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50,000. And for the next 10 years, she gets $2,500. To find out how much she gets in total after 30 years, we just add those two numbers together: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"So, there's this lady Aleena, and she's payin' for a streamin' service. They charge her $140 a month. Now, they charge her the same amount for the first half of the year, and then 10% less for the other half.

For the first half of the year, she pays $140 a month. That's 6 months, so she pays:
140 * 6 = $840

Now, for the second half of the year, they charge her 10% less. 10% of $140 is $14, so she pays $140 - $14 = $126. She pays that for 6 months, so that's:
126 * 6 = $756

So, the total amount she pays is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"So, Sophia's car has a tank that holds 12 gallons of gas. She's already used 4 gallons to fill it up, and she's already driven 100 miles. To figure out how far she can drive on a full tank, we gotta divide the tank's capacity by the amount of gas she used.

12 gallons (tank capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons left

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on those 3 gallons. We can do that by figuring out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know she drove 100 miles on 4 gallons, so we can do:

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles per gallon

To find x, we can multiply 100 by 3 (since there are 3 gallons left) and divide by 4:

(100 * 3) ÷ 4 = 300 ÷ 4
= 75

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a full tank of gas.

Final answer: 75"
"So, Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for 1 hour, 'cause he reads half as long as he watches. That's 2 + 1 = 3 hours a day. He does that 3 times a week, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours a week. If he does that for 4 weeks, that's 9 * 4 = 36 hours."
"So, there's this basketball tournament with four schools. Each school has two teams, one for girls and one for boys, and each team has five players. That's a total of 10 players per school. Since there are four schools, that's 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

And each school also has a coach, so that's 4 coaches. Now, we gotta add the players and the coaches together. 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

So, the answer is 44."
"So, there's this treasure chest with some gems in it. There's 175 diamonds, and there's 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. That means there's 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

Now, there's twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, there's 2 x 140 = 280 emeralds.

Let's add 'em up: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The answer is 595."
"So, there's this school with twice as many boys as girls. I think that means if there's 60 girls, there's 120 boys. Now, we gotta figure out how many teachers there are. We know there's 5 students per teacher, so we divide the total number of students by 5. 

Let's do the math: 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180 students. Now, 180 students divided by 5 students per teacher is... 180 ÷ 5 = 36.

So, there's 36 teachers."
"So, Bailey gets $5 a week for 8 weeks. That's a total of $5 x 8 = $40. If she has $100 at the end, we gotta subtract the $40 from $100 to find out how much she had at first.

$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey had $60 at the start."
"So, Judy teaches dance classes. She teaches 5 classes a day, Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. That's a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays and 8 on Saturday, which is 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

She charges $15 per student, and she has 33 students. So, she makes 33 * 15 = $495 per week.

The final answer is: $495"
"So, Kelian got two recipes. One of 'em has 20 instructions, and the other one has twice as many instructions as the first one. That means the second one has 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.

So, if we add 'em together, we get 20 + 40 = 60 instructions. That's how many instructions Kelian gotta read to make both dishes."
"So, there's this guy Tommy, and he's tryin' to raise money for charity. He's sellin' brownies for $3 each and cheesecakes for $4 each. He sells 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes. 

To figure out how much money he made, we gotta do some math. First, we multiply the number of brownies by the price of each brownie: 43 * 3 = 129. Then, we do the same for the cheesecakes: 23 * 4 = 92. 

Now, we add those two numbers together: 129 + 92 = 221. So, Tommy made 221 dollars.

The final answer is: $221"
"So, Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each. That's a total of 5 x $150 = $750. Now, there's this interest thingy, 2% of $150, which is $3. So, we gotta add that to the total, $750 + $3 = $753. 

Since she's payin' for 3 months, we gotta multiply that by 3, $753 x 3 = $2259.

The answer is: $2259"
"So, there's this fella Artie, and he's got a flower stand at the market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. The prices are like this: marigolds are $2.74, petunias are $1.87, and begonias are $2.12. But Artie don't wanna deal with all that extra change, so he's gonna round the prices to the nearest dollar.

So, let's see how much he makes. He sells 12 marigolds, which is 12 * $2.74 = $32.88. But he rounds that to the nearest dollar, so it's $33.

Then he sells 9 petunias, which is 9 * $1.87 = $16.83. He rounds that to the nearest dollar, so it's $17.

And he sells 17 begonias, which is 17 * $2.12 = $35.64. He rounds that to the nearest dollar, so it's $36.

Now, let's add 'em all up: $33 + $17 + $36 = $86.

The final answer is: $86"
"So, there's this guy Luke, and he's buildin' sandcastles at the beach. He makes 4 levels, and the top one's 16 square feet. Then the next one's half of that, which is 8 square feet. The one below that's half of 8, which is 4 square feet. And the one below that's half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

So, we gotta add 'em all up: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet. Now, we gotta divide that by 4, 'cause there's 4 levels. That's 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.

The final answer is 7.5."
"So, Cecilia got a new puppy. She gotta feed it dog food. The vet said she gotta feed it 1 cup a day for the first 180 days. Then she gotta feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of its life. One bag of dog food got 110 cups in it.

First, let's figure out how much food the puppy needs in the first 180 days. That's 1 cup a day for 180 days, so that's 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After that, the puppy's gonna be 1 year old, and Cecilia's gonna feed it 2 cups a day. There's 365 days in a year, so that's 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

So, the puppy needs 180 + 730 = 910 cups of food in a year. Now, we gotta figure out how many bags of food that is. One bag's got 110 cups, so we divide 910 by 110. That's 910 ÷ 110 = 8.27. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to 9 bags.

The final answer is 9."
"So, we got this thing about laundry, right? There's this guy Raymond, and he does half as much laundry as this other guy Sarah. And Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as this other guy David. We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 

So, we gotta figure out how much laundry David does. We do that by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4, 'cause she does 4 times as much as him. That's 400 divided by 4, which is 100 pounds. That's how much laundry David does.

Now, we gotta figure out how much laundry Raymond does. We do that by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2, 'cause he does half as much as her. That's 400 divided by 2, which is 200 pounds. That's how much laundry Raymond does.

The difference between Raymond and David is 200 minus 100, which is 100 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"So, Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. He wants to buy 18 flowers. 

If he buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he'll need 6 packages. That's 6 * $2.50 = $15. 

If he buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he'll need 9 packages. That's 9 * $1 = $9.

So, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is cheaper. He'll save $15 - $9 = $6.

The answer is: $6"
"So, John takes his dog to the groomer and it costs $100. The groomer says he can give him a discount 'cause he's a new customer. The discount is 30% of the cost. That means 30% of $100 is $30. So, we gotta subtract $30 from $100 to find out how much John pays.

$100 - $30 = $70

So, John pays $70 for the grooming."
"So, we got 24 liters of water. Two girls took 1/6 of it. That's 24 divided by 6, which is 4. So, the girls took 4 liters. Then, a boy took 6 liters. We add those together: 4 + 6 = 10. Now, we subtract 10 from 24: 24 - 10 = 14. So, there's 14 liters left."
"So, Charlie had some stickers. He got some more, and then he gave some away and used some. Let's see...

He had 10 stickers at first. Then he got 21 more, so now he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then he got 23 more for his birthday, so now he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. And then he used 28 stickers for a card, so now he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The answer is: 17"
"So, there's this lady named Grace, and she weighs 125 pounds. Now, there's this other fella named Alex, and he weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. I think I figured out how to do this.

First, I multiply Grace's weight by 4. That's 125 * 4 = 500. Then, I subtract 2 from that. So, 500 - 2 = 498. That's Alex's weight.

Now, I add their weights together. 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623. That's their combined weight.

The final answer is 623."
"So, Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns. To find out how many thorns there are in total, we gotta multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply 3 (rose bushes) by 25 (roses per bush), which is 3 * 25 = 75. Then we multiply 75 by 8 (thorns per rose), which is 75 * 8 = 600.

So, there's 600 thorns in total."
"So, there's this football team that played 22 games. They won more games than they lost, and the difference is 8. 

Let's say they lost x games. Then, they won x + 8 games. We know they played 22 games in total, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.

Combine the x's: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. To find out how many they won, we add 8 to 7: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, they won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"So, Gene is makin' a quilt outta old t-shirts from his vacations. He's got one shirt from each vacation, and he's been doin' that since he was 23 years old. Now he's 34. He goes on 4 vacations a year. 

To figure out how many shirts he's got, we gotta count how many years he's been doin' it. That's 34 - 23 = 11 years. Then we multiply that by 4, 'cause he goes on 4 vacations a year. That's 11 * 4 = 44 shirts. So, he's got 44 shirts, and that's 44 quilt blocks.

Final answer: 44"
"So, there's this alarm thingy that goes off three times a day. It goes off for a bit, then stops. The first time it went off, it went off 4 times. The second time it went off, it went off for 3 times as long as the first time. The third time it went off, it went off for half as long as the second time.

So, let's see... the first time it went off for 4 times. The second time it went off for 3 times as long, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times. The third time it went off for half as long, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add 'em up: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22. So, the alarm went off 22 times in total."
"So, the company pays each employee $600 a month. They increase the salary by 10% every year for those who've been there for 5 years. Sylvie just clocked 5 years, so she gets a 10% raise every year for the next 3 years.

Year 1: 
She gets a $60 raise, so her new salary is $600 + $60 = $660.

Year 2: 
She gets a $66 raise, so her new salary is $660 + $66 = $726.

Year 3: 
She gets a $72.60 raise, so her new salary is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

Year 4: 
She gets a $79.86 raise, so her new salary is $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

Year 5: 
She gets a $87.85 raise, so her new salary is $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31.

Year 6: 
She gets a $96.63 raise, so her new salary is $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94.

Year 7: 
She gets a $106.29 raise, so her new salary is $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23.

Year 8: 
She gets a $116.92 raise, so her new salary is $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15.

Year 9: 
She gets a $128.62 raise, so her new salary is $1286.15 + $128.62 = $1414.77.

Year 10: 
She gets a $141.48 raise, so her new salary is $1414.77 + $141.48 = $1556.25.

The final answer is $1556.25."
"So, there's this lady named Marilyn, and she sold a lot of records. Harald sold some, and then Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald. They sold a total of 88,000 records. We need to figure out how many records Harald sold.

Let's think about it... If Marilyn sold 10 times as many records as Harald, that means Harald sold 1/10 of what Marilyn sold. So, we need to divide 88,000 by 10 to find out how many records Harald sold.

88,000 ÷ 10 = 8,800

So, Harald sold 8,800 records.

$oxed{8,800}$"
"So, Christina's got a birthday party and she needs gift bags for her friends. She invited 16 friends, but some of 'em don't show up. She needs 3/4 of the friends to come, so that's 16 * 3/4 = 12 friends. 

Now, she needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend, so that's 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"So, there's this big dinosaur named Ted, and he's makin' potato salad for a picnic. He knows that grown-up dinosaurs eat a lot, like 10 pounds, and little dinosaurs eat half that, which is 5 pounds. There's gonna be 20 grown-ups and 5 little ones comin' to the picnic. 

To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs, we gotta do some math. First, we multiply the number of grown-ups by how much they eat: 20 grown-ups * 10 pounds = 200 pounds. Then, we do the same for the little ones: 5 little ones * 5 pounds = 25 pounds. 

Now, we add those two numbers together: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds. So, Ted needs 225 pounds of potato salad for the picnic.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"So, there's this lady Cindy, and she's got 4 pets. Then there's this other lady Marcia, and she's got 2 more pets than Cindy. So, Marcia's got 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Now, there's this other lady Jan, and she's got 3 times as many pets as Marcia. So, Jan's got 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

To find out how many pets they all have in total, we just add 'em up: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The answer is 28."
"So, there's this lady, Emily, and she's got four kids. Their names are Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. 

We know James is 10 years old, and he's one year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, Amy is two years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is five years older than Jackson. So, Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is 4."
"So, there's this guy Lee, and he's super fast at runnin' the 400-meter hurdles. He's 2 seconds faster than this other guy Gerald. Now, Gerald's diet changed, and he's gettin' faster. He's gettin' 10% faster, which is like, a big deal.

So, we know Lee's time is 38 seconds. We need to figure out how fast Gerald was before. Let's call that time 'x'. Since Lee's 2 seconds faster, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 38. 

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36. That's how fast Gerald was before his diet change.

Now, we need to find out how fast Gerald is now. We know he's 10% faster, so we gotta calculate 10% of 36. That's 0.1 * 36 = 3.6. Then we add that to his old time: 36 + 3.6 = 39.6.

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is 39.6."
"So, there's this neighborhood with a bunch of pets. They got dogs and cats, and some rabbits too. The thing is, the rabbits are 12 less than the dogs and cats put together. And, there's two cats for every dog. We know there's 60 dogs, so we gotta find out how many cats they got.

We do that by multiplying the dogs by 2, 'cause there's two cats for every dog. So, 60 dogs times 2 cats is 120 cats.

Now, we gotta find out how many rabbits. We add the dogs and cats together, and then we subtract 12. That's 60 + 120, which is 180. Then we subtract 12, and that's 168 rabbits.

Finally, we add up all the pets: 60 dogs, 120 cats, and 168 rabbits. That's 348 pets in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"So, we got 200 kids in the class. 2/5 of 'em are boys, that's 80. So, the rest are girls, which is 120. Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. That's 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout. 

To find the girls not in the girl scout, we subtract 80 from 120. That's 40 girls not in the girl scout.

The final answer is 40."
"So, Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we gotta do some math. We gotta multiply 2/3 by 9. 

2/3 * 9 = 6

Now, we gotta find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do that by subtractin' the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 - 6 = 3

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"So, there's this lady named Freda, and she's makin' tomato sauce. She uses them canned tomatoes, and they shrink when she cooks 'em. She uses a can that's 16 ounces, and it's got 3 tomatoes in it. She made 32 ounces of sauce, but she lost half of it. That means she used half of the 32 ounces.

Half of 32 is 16, so she used 16 ounces of sauce. Now, we gotta figure out how many cans of tomatoes that is. We know each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 16 by 16. That's 1. But wait, each can's got 3 tomatoes, so we gotta multiply 1 by 3. That's 3.

So, Freda used 3 tomatoes.

Final answer: 3"
"So, there's this traffic jam on the motorway. Some cars go through in the first 15 minutes, then some more go through in the next 15 minutes. 5 cars leave the motorway 'cause they don't wanna deal with the traffic. There's originally 30 cars on the motorway. We gotta figure out how many cars went through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's say the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes is x. Then, the number of cars that went through in the next 15 minutes is 20. We know that 5 cars left, so the total number of cars that went through is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we know that 20 cars went through in the next 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

So, 5 cars went through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The answer is 5."
"So Mary got 18 new plants from the nursery. She already had 2 plants on each of the 40 window ledges. That's 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she got 18 more, so she had 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

She's gonna give 1 plant from each ledge to her friends and family. There's 40 ledges, so she's giving away 40 plants. That means she's left with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.

The answer is 58."
"So, there's this fella named Jerome, and he's got 4 friends comin' over. The first friend rings the doorbell 20 times. Then, the second friend rings it 1/4 more than the first friend, which is 20 + 5 = 25. The third friend rings it 10 more than the fourth friend, and the fourth friend rings it 60 times. 

Now, let's add 'em up: 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175."
"So, Solo gotta read a lot of pages from his books. He gotta read 4 pages from Science, 20 pages from Social Studies, 7 pages from History, and 8 pages from Geography. That's a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages, so he still gotta read 39 - 15 = 24 pages. He's got 4 more days to finish, so we gotta divide 24 by 4 to see how many pages he needs to read per day. That's 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day.

So, he needs to read 6 pages per day to finish his books."
"So, there's this fella named John. He likes to drink water with his meals, and before bed. He does this every day, but on weekends, he likes to drink soda with his dinner instead of water. 

Let's see, he drinks water with his meals and before bed, that's 3 times a day. That's 3 times 7 days, which is 21. But on the weekends, he drinks water only 1 time. So, we gotta subtract 2 from 21. That's 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"So, there's this fog bank rollin' in from the ocean, and it's gonna cover a big ol' city. It takes 10 minutes for it to cover 3 miles of the city. The city is 42 miles across, from the ocean to the other side.

To figure out how long it'll take for the whole city to be covered, we gotta divide the city's size by how fast it covers the distance. So, we do 42 miles divided by 3 miles, and then multiply that by 10 minutes.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14
14 x 10 minutes = 140 minutes

So, it's gonna take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"So, there's this lady named Poppy, and she's tryin' to do a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, and then her mom puts some more pieces on. I'm not really sure how many pieces her mom puts on, but I think it's a third of the rest.

So, let's see... if she puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, that's 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces. That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

Now, her mom puts a third of the remaining pieces on the board. I think that's 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces. That leaves 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

So, there's 500 pieces left to put on the board."
"So, there's this guy Amir, and he eats 5 cookies. Then there's this other guy Cody, and he eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. Now, we gotta add 'em up, right? Amir had 5, and Cody had 15. So, 5 + 15 is... 20."
"So, we got 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But we gotta take away the walls, 'cause they're 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches from the length, 2 inches from the width, and 2 inches from the height. That leaves us with 3 inches, 4 inches, and 2 inches.

Now, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24. That's the volume of one box. We got 3 boxes, so we multiply that by 3: 24 x 3 = 72.

The final answer is: 72"
"So, Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. He watches a 1-hour show on Monday and Tuesday, and then he watches some stuff on Wednesday. On Thursday, he watches a 1-hour show and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he watches two 1-hour shows. He watched a total of 7 hours of TV.

Let's see, if he watches 1 hour on Monday and Tuesday, that's 2 hours. Then he watches some stuff on Wednesday, and then 1.5 hours on Thursday. And on Friday, he watches 2 hours. So, if we add all that up, we get 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

That means he watches 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday. Now, we need to figure out how many 30-minute episodes that is. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"So, Henry's makin' cookies for a bakin' compo. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. Let's say he made x cookies last year. This year, he made 2x cookies. But he made 15 more than he meant to, so he made 2x + 15 cookies. Then, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he's got 110 cookies left.

We can set up an equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplify it to 2x + 10 = 110. Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100. Divide both sides by 2: x = 50.

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this gas station and they're sellin' gas for $3.00 a gallon. There's also this app that gives you 20 cents back for every gallon you buy. If someone buys 10 gallons, how much are they gonna pay?

Let's see... if they buy 10 gallons at $3.00 each, that's 10 x $3.00 = $30.00. Then, they get 20 cents back for each gallon, so that's 10 x 20 cents = $2.00. Now, we gotta subtract the cashback from the total cost. So, $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The answer is $28.00."
"So, there's this thing about these fruit roll-ups, right? They're like, long and stuff. Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long, and Marcell's are 3 wide and 14 long. They ate 'em all, and now we gotta figure out how many they ate on average.

First, we gotta count how many roll-ups they had. Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 * 24 = 48, and Marcell's are 3 * 14 = 42. Then we add 'em together: 48 + 42 = 90.

Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause they ate 'em all. 90 / 2 = 45.

So, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average.

The final answer is 45."
"So, there's this lady named Julia, and she's out on a boat on a lake. The boat's got a leak, and it's takin' in water for every 10 feet she rows back to shore. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, and the shore's 64 seconds away. We gotta figure out how much water the boat's taken on by the time she gets there.

First, we gotta find out how many times she rows 20 feet to get to the shore. We do that by dividin' the distance to the shore (64 seconds) by the time it takes her to row 20 feet (16 seconds). That's 64 / 16 = 4. So, she rows 20 feet 4 times.

Now, we know the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 x 10 feet, the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 20 feet. We know she rows 20 feet 4 times, so we multiply 2 liters by 4 to find out how much water the boat's taken on: 2 x 4 = 8 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"So, we got a classroom with 4 teachers. They each teach 2 lessons a day, and they clean the whiteboard 3 times per lesson. We need to figure out how many times the whiteboard gets cleaned in a day.

Let's do the math: 4 teachers * 2 lessons = 8 lessons. Then, we multiply that by 3 cleanings per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

So, the whiteboard gets cleaned 24 times a day."
"So, Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. He does this for 15 days. But then, 5 flowers don't grow. We need to figure out how many flowers he has now.

Let's see... He plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. But 5 of those didn't grow, so we gotta subtract those. That leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

The answer is 25."
"So, there's this guy Jamal and his phone. It can hold a lot of pictures, like 1800. Now, there's this other girl, Brittany, and her phone can hold less, like 300 pictures. The thing is, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Brittany's. So, if we divide 1800 by 6, we get 300. That's how many pictures Brittany's phone can hold.

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture. To find out how many ducks are in the picture, we gotta divide 300 by 50. That's 6 ducks.

The answer is 6."
"So, Sasha got some lumber and now she's tryin' to sell it. She's got 10 of them 2 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $10 each. That's 10 * $10 = $100.

Then she's got 5 of them 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. That's 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, the prices went up by 50%, so the new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The 4 x 4 x 10 boards are now $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

She sells all 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $15 each, so that's 10 * $15 = $150. And she sells all 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $24 each, so that's 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"So, there's this lady named Katy, and she makes coffee. She uses sugar and water in a certain ratio. The ratio is 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. We don't know how many cups of water she used, but we know she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and some cups of water. We need to figure out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

First, we need to find out how many parts of the ratio Katy used in total. We add the parts of sugar and water: 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Now, we know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar. We need to find out how many teaspoons are in one part of the ratio. We do this by dividing 120 by 7: 120 ÷ 7 = 17.14 (but we can't use that, we need a whole number).

Let's try dividing 120 by 7 again, and this time, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 120 ÷ 7 = 17.14, so we'll use 17.

Now, we multiply 17 by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar: 17 * 7 = 119.

So, Katy used 119 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is 119."
"So, John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids. Each pair costs $60. I'm gonna multiply the number of kids by the number of pairs per kid, then multiply that by the cost per pair.

Number of kids: 3
Number of pairs per kid: 2
Cost per pair: $60

First, I multiply the number of kids by the number of pairs per kid: 3 * 2 = 6
Then, I multiply that by the cost per pair: 6 * $60 = $360

John paid $360."
"So, there's this customs officer at the port, and he's countin' containers with cars inside. He starts with 2 containers, and each one's got 5 cars. That's 2 x 5 = 10 cars. Then, more containers come in, and now there's 30 cars in total. We need to figure out how many more containers came in.

Let's subtract the initial 2 containers from the total number of cars: 30 - 10 = 20. Since each container's got 5 cars, we divide 20 by 5 to find out how many containers came in: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

So, 4 containers came in on the second day.

The final answer is 4."
"So, we got two peoples' salary, Adrien and Lylah. Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's. We know Adrien's old salary was $40000. We need to find out how much more he got, which is 30% of $40000. That's 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's old salary. We can do that by dividing Adrien's old salary by 1.3. That's $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23. Now, we need to find Lylah's new salary. We know it's 40% more than her old salary. 40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69. So, Lylah's new salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92.

The total salary they got four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"So, there's this guy Miguel, and he uses 2 pads of paper a week for drawing. Each pad has 30 sheets. We need to figure out how many sheets he uses in a month. There's about 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply 2 pads by 4 weeks:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Now, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets in a pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"So, Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"So, there's this lady named Sadie. She slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each day for the next two days, and then she slept 1 hour more than that for the rest of the week. 

Let's see... Monday's 8 hours, Tuesday's 6 hours, Wednesday's 4 hours. Then Thursday's 5 hours, Friday's 6 hours, Saturday's 7 hours, and Sunday's 8 hours.

Now, let's add 'em up: 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 40

The final answer is 40."
"So, there's this lady named Rosie. She runs real fast, like 10 miles per hour. She does that for 3 hours, and then she slows down to 5 miles per hour. We need to figure out how far she can run in 7 hours.

First, let's see how far she runs in the first 3 hours. That's easy, just multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours. That's 30 miles. Then, she runs for 4 more hours at 5 miles per hour. That's 5 miles per hour times 4 hours, which is 20 miles. Now, we add those two numbers together: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Jennie's mom's office has a bunch of letters. There's a pile of letters that need stamps and a pile of letters that already have stamps on 'em. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters that need stamps. That's 60 letters, and she puts stamps on 20 of 'em. Now, there's 30 letters in the pile with stamps.

To figure out how many letters were in that pile when Jennie started, we gotta subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the 30 letters that have stamps now. That's 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile with stamps when Jennie started.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Julia was gettin' ready for a dinner party and she was out of spoons. She bought some new ones, then her husband got her some more. She used some of 'em to taste her stew, and when she was settin' the table, she had 12 spoons. 

Let's say the number of spoons in the package she bought is x. Then, her husband gave her 5 more spoons. She used 3 spoons, so we gotta subtract those from the total. That leaves us with the spoons she bought plus the ones her husband gave her. We know that's equal to 12. So we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying it, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtractin' 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package she bought had 10 spoons.

The answer is: 10"
"So, Dylan bought some chicken sausages and fish sausages. He got 38 chicken sausages. He got 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. That means he got 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find out how many sausages he got in total, we gotta add 'em together. So, 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages.

The final answer is 82."
"So, there's this girl Amy and she made 20 more friends than this other girl Lily. Lily made 50 friends. We need to figure out how many friends Amy made. We do that by addin' 20 to 50, which is 70. 

Now we gotta add the number of friends Amy and Lily have. We do that by addin' 50 and 70, which is 120."
"So, there's this lady, her mom, she sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the store. Watermelons cost three times as much as peppers, and oranges are 5 dollars less than watermelons. 

First, we gotta figure out how much a watermelon costs. Since peppers cost 15 dollars, and watermelons cost three times that, watermelons cost 3 * 15 = 45 dollars.

Now, we gotta figure out how much oranges cost. Oranges are 5 dollars less than watermelons, so oranges cost 45 - 5 = 40 dollars.

Dillon's goin' to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. So, we gotta add up the cost of all that stuff.

4 watermelons cost 4 * 45 = 180 dollars.
20 peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300 dollars.
10 oranges cost 10 * 40 = 400 dollars.

Add 'em all up: 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 dollars.

The answer is: $880"
"So, there's this hospital that sees a lot of people every day. They see 500 people, and each person stays for 24 minutes. That's a lotta time, right?

So, we gotta figure out how much time they spend on all these people. We do that by multiplying 500 people by 24 minutes, which is 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 12,000 by 60 to get 200 hours.

Now, the doctors charge $150 an hour, and the hospital charges $200 an hour. So, the doctors make $150 * 200 = $30,000, and the hospital makes $200 * 200 = $40,000. 

The total amount of money they make is $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000. But they also spend $30,000 on the doctors. So, the profit is $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000.

The answer is: $40,000"
"So, Nissa hires 60 elves. Then, a third of 'em quit. That's 60 divided by 3, which is 20. So, 20 elves leave. That means there's 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit. That's 40 minus 10, which is 30. So, there's 30 elves left.

The answer is 30."
"So, there's this guy Joseph, and he spent some money in May. It was $500. Then, in June, he spent less money, which was $60 less than May. So, we gotta subtract $60 from $500 to find out how much he spent in June.

$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the money he spent in May and June to find the total. $500 + $440 = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"So, Pam and Fred went to a carnival. They rode a roller coaster thingy. Pam rode it 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Then they rode a luge thingy 2 times each. Each ride cost 6 tickets. 

To find out how many tickets they used, we gotta add up the tickets for the roller coaster and the luge. 

Pam used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster. 
Fred used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets for the roller coaster. 
They both used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets for the luge. 

So, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets in total.

The answer is 60."
"So, Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Then, he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday. That's 6 * 4 = 24 miles. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. We know he walked a total of 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday. We also know he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we gotta subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"So, Tom gets 4 car washes a month. That's a lot, right? Each car wash costs $15. To figure out how much he pays in a year, we gotta multiply the number of car washes by the number of months in a year, and then by the cost of each car wash.

Let's do the math: 4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year. Now, we multiply that by the cost of each car wash: 48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year.

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for all those car washes."
"So, there's this guy Brian, and he's got 20 video games. But then he loses 5, so now he's got 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, there's this other guy Bobby, and he's got some video games too. He's got 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we gotta figure out how many video games Bobby's got.

Let's say Bobby's got x video games. Then, 3 times as many as Brian's video games would be 3 * 15 = 45. And Bobby's got 5 fewer than that, so we subtract 5 from 45. That's 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby's got 40 video games.

The final answer is 40."
"So, there's this thing about unicorns, right? There's 27 of 'em in the world. And some of 'em live in the Scottish Highlands. Now, I'm not exactly sure how many, but I think it's one third of the total. So, if we got 27 unicorns, and one third of 'em live in the Highlands, that's 27 divided by 3, which is... 9. That's how many unicorns live in the Highlands.

Now, I heard that two thirds of the unicorns in the Highlands are female. So, if we got 9 unicorns in the Highlands, and two thirds of 'em are female, that's 9 divided by 3, which is... 3. That's how many female unicorns live in the Highlands.

So, to answer the question, there are 3 female Scottish unicorns."
"So, Rory orders stuff. She gets 2 subs, 2 bags of chips, and 2 cookies. The subs cost $7.50 each, the chips cost $1.50 each, and the cookies cost $1.00 each.

First, let's add up the cost of the subs: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
Then, let's add the cost of the chips: $15.00 + $3.00 = $18.00
And finally, let's add the cost of the cookies: $18.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Now, there's a delivery fee. It's 20% of $20.00. To find 20% of $20.00, I'll multiply $20.00 by 0.20. That's $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

So, the total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to give the delivery guy a tip. She wants to give him $5.00. So, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"So, there's this guy Mark, and he took two tests. The first one had 75 questions, and he finished it in 8 hours. He can do 5 questions per hour. That means he did 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

Then, he took another test with 100 questions, and he did it in 6 hours. He can still do 5 questions per hour, so he did 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

Now, let's add the questions he did in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions. Since the first test had 75 questions, we subtract 70 from 75 to find out how many he left incomplete: 75 - 70 = 5 questions.

The answer is 5."
"So, there's this candy machine with blue gumballs and pink gumballs. We know there's 12 blue ones. Now, we gotta figure out how many pink ones there are. The thing is, there's 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. So, we gotta multiply the blue ones by 4 and then add 22.

Let's do that: 4 * 12 = 48, then 48 + 22 = 70. So, there's 70 pink gumballs.

The answer is: 70"
"So, we got 20 cars in total. Out of those, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic. To find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the other two from the total.

20 - 12 - 4 = 4

Now, we need to find what percentage 4 is of 20. To do that, we divide 4 by 20 and multiply by 100.

4 ÷ 20 = 0.2
0.2 * 100 = 20

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"So, there's this big hive with 700 bees. I heard there's twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. 

Let's start with the queens. If there's twice as many baby bees as queens, that means the number of baby bees is 2 times the number of queens. We can call the number of queens ""Q"". So, the number of baby bees is 2Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700. The total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. We can write an equation: 700 = worker bees + baby bees + queens.

We know that the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so we can write another equation: worker bees = 2 * baby bees. And we know that baby bees = 2Q. So, worker bees = 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Now we have two equations:

700 = worker bees + baby bees + queens
700 = 4Q + 2Q + Q

Combine like terms:
700 = 7Q

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
Baby bees = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:
Worker bees = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is 400."
"So, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. That's a lot of time. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. If he worked instead of playing video games, how much money would he make in a week?

Let's see... If he plays for 2 hours a day, that's 2 hours a day * 7 days a week = 14 hours a week. He makes $10 an hour, so he'd make 14 hours * $10 an hour = $140 a week.

The answer is $140."
"So, John buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. He also has to pay 10% tax on the non-food stuff.

First, let's add up the cost of the food stuff: milk and eggs. That's 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of the non-food stuff: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. That's 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

The tax on the non-food stuff is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

So, the total cost of the non-food stuff with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the food stuff and the non-food stuff with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

So, everything cost John 16 dollars.

The final answer is 16."
"So, there's this fella, Kim, and he's got a housekeeping business. He's already got 3 clients, but he's talkin' to 5 more, so that's 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 each and the cloths cost $5 each.

First, let's figure out how much bleach he needs. 8 clients * 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles. 16 bottles * $2 per bottle = $32. That's the cost of bleach.

Now, let's figure out how much the cloths cost. 8 clients * 1 pack per client = 8 packs. 8 packs * $5 per pack = $40. That's the cost of cloths.

So, the total expenses are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income. $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is $20."
"So, John got 10 hectares of land and there's 100 pineapples in each hectare. That's 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples. He can pick 'em every 3 months. There's 4 three-month periods in a year, so he can pick 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples in a year.

The answer is 4000."
"So, Johnny's got a bunch of lego boxes on the floor. There's one with 500 pieces, one with 3 times more pieces than that one, and one with 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one. I'm gonna count 'em up.

The first box has 500 pieces. Then there's the one with 3 times more pieces, so that's 3 * 500 = 1500. And the last one's got 1/4 of the first box, so that's 1/4 * 500 = 125.

Now, let's add 'em up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The answer is: 2125"
"So, Debra is watchin' a beehive, and she sees some bees leavin' and some bees comin' back. 

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees come back, which is 15 bees. 

Next, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 60 bees. So, the total number of bees that left in the first 3 periods is 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees. 

15 bees had already come back, so the number of bees that left in the first 3 periods and hadn't come back yet is 105 - 15 = 90 bees. 

In the last 6 hours, all those bees come back, which is 90 bees.

The answer is 90."
"So, Brittany and her mom went to the museum. They bought a ticket for a kid and a ticket for the mom. The kid's ticket costs $10 and the mom's ticket costs $12. They gave the cashier some money and got $8 back. To find out how much money they gave the cashier, we gotta add the cost of the tickets together. 

$10 (kid's ticket) + $12 (mom's ticket) = $22

They got $8 back, so they must've given the cashier $22 (tickets) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"So, there's this guy Charlie and he's got 12 Facebook friends. He's got three times as many friends as this other guy Dorothy. That means Dorothy's got 12 divided by 3, which is 4. 

Now, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we gotta multiply Dorothy's friends by 4. That's 4 * 4, which is 16."
"So, Steve and Tim are racin' to see who gets home first. Steve lives way farther than Tim, so he gets to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school, and he can ride his bike 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school, and he can ride his skateboard 264 feet per minute.

First, we gotta convert the distance to feet. There's 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can figure out how long it takes each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve gets home first, Tim's gonna be waitin' for him. We gotta find out how long Tim's gonna wait. We do that by subtractin' Steve's time from Tim's time:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, Tim's gonna be waitin' 4 minutes for Steve to get home.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Shawnda's got a bike thingy where she inflates tires for people. She charges 25 cents per tire. 

She had 5 people on bikes, and they needed 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 * 0.25 = 2.50 dollars. Then, she had 3 people on tricycles, and they needed 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 * 0.25 = 2.25 dollars. And, she had 1 person on a unicycle, and they needed 1 tire, so that's 1 * 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 dollars.

Adding all that up, she made 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5.00 dollars.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"So Carl buys a bunch of cookies, right? He buys 10 packs, and each pack has 6 cookies in it. That's a lotta cookies! 

So, we gotta figure out how much it costs. Each cookie is 10 cents, and there's 60 cookies in total. We multiply the number of cookies by the price per cookie: 60 * 10 cents = $6.

Now, Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

The answer is $4."
"So, there's this guy Dave, and he buys a pack of french fries. He eats 14 of 'em, and then a seagull comes and takes the rest. The seagull eats half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

Then, three pigeons come and take some fries. They each take 3 fries, so they take 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, we gotta figure out how many fries were left before the pigeons came.

We know the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons took 9 fries. So, the fries left before the pigeons came is 7 + 9 = 16.

A raccoon comes and takes 2/3 of the fries that were left. We don't know how many fries were left, so let's call it 'x'. The raccoon takes 2/3 of 'x', which is 2/3 * x. We know that 1/3 of 'x' is 16, so x = 16 * 3 = 48.

The raccoon took 2/3 of 48, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32. So, the raccoon took 32 fries.

Now, we gotta figure out how many fries were left before the raccoon came. We know the raccoon took 32 fries, and the pigeons took 9 fries. So, the fries left before the raccoon came is 48 - 32 - 9 = 7.

The seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons took 9 fries. So, the seagull and pigeons took 7 + 9 = 16 fries. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull and pigeons took 16 fries. So, the fries left when Dave bought the pack is 14 + 16 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"So, there's this guy Kimo, and he's a college student. He's got classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and he's got 3 classes each day, which is 3 hours each. That's 3 * 3 = 9 hours per day. He does that 3 days a week, so that's 9 * 3 = 27 hours per week.

Then, he's got classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and he's got 2 classes each day, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours each. He does that 2 days a week, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

There's 16 weeks in a semester, so he spends 27 * 16 = 432 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Adding those together, he spends 432 + 128 = 560 hours in a semester.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"So, Bill bakes a lot of stuff every day. He makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. We need to figure out how long all the baked goods are when you put 'em all together.

First, let's do the rolls. 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. That's a lotta inches!

Now, let's do the croissants. 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Still a lot of inches!

And then there's the baguettes. 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches. Whoa, that's a lot of inches too!

Now, we need to convert all these inches into feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in feet = (1200 + 720 + 2880) / 12
Total length in feet = 4800 / 12
Total length in feet = 400 feet

So, all the baked goods are 400 feet long when you put 'em all together.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"So, the zookeeper needs to order bananas for the apes. There's the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. The monkeys need 200 bananas a month, and they need it for 2 months, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 bananas. The gorillas need 400 bananas a month, and they need it for 2 months, so that's 400 * 2 = 800 bananas. The baboons need 100 bananas a month, and they need it for 2 months, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add 'em up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas. So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"So, Blake and Kelly are runnin' on a football field that's 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. That's 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Then, Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Now, we gotta see who wins. Since 6120 yards is more than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we gotta subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The answer is 4620."
"So, Raphael went to buy some school stuff. He bought 4 pens, 2 notebooks, and a big roll of paper. The pens cost a buck fifty each, the notebooks cost four bucks each, and the paper cost twenty bucks.

Let's see... 4 pens is 4 x $1.5, that's 6 bucks. 2 notebooks is 2 x $4, that's 8 bucks. And the paper is 20 bucks.

Now, let's add 'em up: 6 + 8 + 20 is... 34 bucks!"
"So, Finn had 11 tadpoles at first. Then, 6 came out from under a lily pad. That's good, but then 2 hid under a rock. So, we gotta subtract the 2 that hid from the 11. That leaves us with 11 - 2 = 9."
"So, there's this tank with water in it. It's 17 feet deep on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, it gets 7 feet more water, so it's 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep. Now, on Wednesday, the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, I just multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's 48 ÷ 3 = 16 feet. So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"So, Anakin and Locsin went to the beach. Anakin caught some fish. He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Locsin caught some fish too. He caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. He caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

So, the total number of fish caught is 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

The final answer is 32."
"So, there's this bag of marbles that costs $20. The price goes up by 20% every two months. I'm gonna calculate how much it costs after 36 months.

First, I'll calculate the price after 2 months. That's 20% of $20, which is $4. So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

Then, I'll calculate the price after 4 months. That's 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

I'll keep doing that for the next few months. After 6 months, the price is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56. After 8 months, it's $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47. After 10 months, it's $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76. After 12 months, it's $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71. After 14 months, it's $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65. After 16 months, it's $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98. After 18 months, it's $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18. After 20 months, it's $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82. After 22 months, it's $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58. After 24 months, it's $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30. After 26 months, it's $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96. After 28 months, it's $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75. After 30 months, it's $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30. After 32 months, it's $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96. After 34 months, it's $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95. After 36 months, it's $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74.

So, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74.

The final answer is $532.74."
"So, there's this room with toys in it. There's 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures. And, one red car costs $4. An action figure costs $5.

We gotta figure out how much all the toys are worth. Let's start with the doll. Since it costs the same as 3 action figures, and an action figure is $5, the doll must be $15.

Now, we know one red car costs $4. We got 5 of 'em, so that's 5 * $4 = $20.

We got 3 action figures, and we know they cost $5 each, so that's 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add 'em all up: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The answer is: $50"
"So, there's this lady named Jackie. She's thinkin' about doin' her taxes by herself or gettin' some help from an accountant. If she does it by herself, she'll be missin' out on 3 hours of work, and she makes $35 an hour. That's a total of 3 * 35 = 105 bucks she's gonna miss out on.

Now, the accountant is gonna charge her 90 bucks. So, if she hires the accountant, she's gonna have 90 bucks less than she woulda had she done it herself. To find out how much more money she'll have, we gotta subtract 90 from 105.

105 - 90 = 15

So, Jackie will have 15 more bucks if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"So Elvira got a new computer and some other stuff for her birthday. She got a computer that costs 1090 euros, a scanner for 157 euros, a CD burner for 74 euros, and a printer for 102 euros. We gotta add all these numbers together to see how much she spent.

1090 + 157 = 1247
1247 + 74 = 1321
1321 + 102 = 1423

So she spent 1423 euros on all that stuff. She had 1500 euros to start with. To find out how much she has left, we gotta subtract 1423 from 1500.

1500 - 1423 = 77

So Elvira has 77 euros left for clothes.

77"
"So, Sandra's neighbor gives her eggs when she watches their kid. She needs 3 eggs for that Spanish dessert thingy. She needs 15 of 'em. How many times does she gotta watch the kid?

Let's see... if she gets 3 eggs each time, and she needs 15, we gotta divide 15 by 3. That's like, 15 ÷ 3 = 5.

So, she needs to watch the kid 5 times."
"So, there's this guy Seth and he's twice as old as this other guy Brooke. They're gonna be 28 years old together in 2 years. We need to figure out how old Seth is now.

Let's say Seth's age is x. Then Brooke's age is x/2. In 2 years, Seth's gonna be x + 2 and Brooke's gonna be x/2 + 2. We know that in 2 years, they're gonna be 28 years old together, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

We can combine the numbers on the left side:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Now, let's get rid of the 4 on the left side:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 48

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Ethel has $8. We gotta double that, 'cause Jimmy's got more than that. Double $8 is $16. Then we add $2, 'cause Jimmy's got $2 more than that. So, $16 + $2 is $18.

The answer is 18."
"So, Pancho walks a lot. He walks 20 miles a day, but on weekends, he only walks 10 miles. We gotta figure out how many miles he walks in a whole week.

Let's see... There's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. That's 5 days, and he walks 20 miles each day. That's 5 x 20 = 100 miles.

Then there's Saturday and Sunday, and he walks 10 miles each day. That's 2 x 10 = 20 miles.

So, in total, Pancho walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"So, there's this thing about a marching band gettin' new uniforms. They gotta buy a hat, a jacket, and some pants. The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it's 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add 'em up: $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150. That's the total cost of each uniform."
"So, Jake is walkin' through the Museum of Entomology. He sees a bunch of spiders, and they got 8 legs each. There's 80 of 'em. Then he sees some insects, and they got 6 legs each. There's 90 of 'em. And then he sees some weird invertebrates, and they got 10 legs each. There's 3 of 'em.

To figure out how many legs Jake sees in total, I just add 'em all up. 

First, I add the spiders: 80 x 8 = 640 legs. Then I add the insects: 90 x 6 = 540 legs. And finally, I add the invertebrates: 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, I add 'em all together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"So, there's this thing about birds, right? There's Sally Two, Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Thirty-two. 

Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"So, there's this lady named Jessica, and she's tryin' to pay off her debts. She's got student loans, credit cards, and a mortgage. The minimum payments for those are $300, $200, and $500, respectively. She wants to pay more than the minimum, but I'm not sure how much more.

I think she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, I'm gonna calculate that. 50% of $300 is $150, and 50% of $200 is $100. Add those together, and you get $250. Then, add that to the $500 mortgage payment, and you get $750. Now, add that to the $300 student loan payment and the $200 credit card payment, and you get $1150.

Now, I'm gonna multiply that by 12 to see how much she pays in a year. $1150 x 12 is $13,800.

The final answer is: $13,800"
"So, Billy's gotta peel and cut 60 potatoes for his family reunion. He peels 'em in 1.5 minutes, and cuts 'em in 5 seconds. To figure out how long it'll take him, we gotta add those times together. 

1.5 minutes is 90 seconds, and 5 seconds is already in seconds, so we just add 'em: 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. Now, we gotta multiply that by 60 potatoes. 

60 * 95 = 5700 seconds. That's a lotta seconds! If we convert it to minutes, we get 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes. That's a long time, but Billy's gotta get it done.

Final answer: 95"
"So, Juan and his brother Carlos are sellin' lemonade. They gotta buy lemons and sugar for each gallon, and they sell each glass for 50 cents. They make 20 glasses per gallon. They made 25 bucks in profit. 

First, we gotta figure out how much they made from sellin' lemonade. They sell 20 glasses for 50 cents each, so that's 20 x 0.50 = 10 bucks per gallon. They made 25 bucks in profit, so they musta made 25 + 10 = 35 bucks in total.

Now, they spent 3 bucks on lemons and 2 bucks on sugar for each gallon. So, they spent 3 + 2 = 5 bucks on stuff for each gallon. They made 35 bucks, so they musta made 35 / 5 = 7 gallons.

Since they made 7 gallons, they spent 7 x 5 = 35 bucks on lemons.

35"
"So, we got a bunch of people racin' around, and I'm tryin' to figure out how many Chinese folks are there. We know there's 240 people in total, and 80 of 'em are Japanese. That means the rest are Chinese. So, we subtract 80 from 240 to find out how many Chinese people there are.

240 - 80 = 160

Now, we know there's 60 Chinese boys. To find out how many Chinese girls there are, we gotta subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 - 60 = 100

So, there's 100 Chinese girls."
"So, Zaid gets 6000 dollars a month. He spends 1/4 of that on rent, which is 1500 dollars. He spends 1/3 of that on car fuel, which is 2000 dollars. That's a total of 3500 dollars spent so far.

He's got 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars left. Then he donates half of that to charity, which is 1250 dollars. Now he's got 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

He gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so that's 900 dollars spent. That leaves him with 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars.

So, Zaid's got 350 dollars left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"So, there's this lady named Rani, and she's got more crabs than this other lady named Monic. Monic's got 4 fewer crabs than this other guy named Bo. Bo's got 40 crabs. 

We need to figure out how many crabs Rani's got. Since Monic's got 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we subtract 4 from 40. That's 40 - 4 = 36. So Monic's got 36 crabs.

Now, Rani's got 10 more crabs than Monic. We add 10 to 36, and that's 46. So Rani's got 46 crabs.

We add up all the crabs: Bo's 40, Monic's 36, and Rani's 46. That's 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The answer is 122."
"So, there's this guy Lloyd, and he's makin' $10 an hour. He worked 5 hours the first week and 8 hours the second week. I'm gonna calculate how much he made.

For the first week, he made 10 bucks an hour times 5 hours, that's 10 * 5 = 50 bucks. Then, for the second week, he made 10 bucks an hour times 8 hours, that's 10 * 8 = 80 bucks.

So, if I add those two numbers together, he made 50 + 80 = 130 bucks.

The final answer is: $130"
"So, we got two people runnin' for class rep at Sarai's school. One guy got 3/4 of the votes, and there was 80 people votin'. We need to figure out how many votes the other guy got.

To do that, we gotta find out how many votes the first guy got. We do that by multiplyin' 3/4 by 80. That's like, 3 groups of 80, and then we take 1/4 of that. So, 3 groups of 80 is 240, and 1/4 of that is 60. So, the first guy got 60 votes.

Now, we gotta find out how many votes the other guy got. We do that by subtractin' 60 from 80. That's 80 minus 60, which is 20.

The answer is 20."
"So, there's this lady named Sandra, and she's mad at this guy Fred. She ordered some flowers, and he messed up. She got 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. She also got 200 pink calla lilies, which is 5 times the number of white carnations. 

Let's figure out how many white carnations she got. We know that 5 times the white carnations is 200. So, we divide 200 by 5, and that's 40 white carnations. 

Now, we know that the red roses are 4 times the white carnations. So, we multiply 40 by 4, and that's 160 red roses. 

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm or else Sandra's gonna leave him."
"So, there's this lady Jan, she's 30 years old. Now, let's figure out the other two's ages.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Now, since then, Mark has gotten 2 years older, so he's 20 + 2 = 22 years old now.

And Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"So, there's this 4 by 400 meter relay thingy. Two teams, right? One team is super good, and each of 'em runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. The other team ain't so good, and their first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Then each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the last one.

Let's see how long it takes the not-so-good team. The first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so that's 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so that's 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so that's 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, let's add up the times for the not-so-good team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The super good team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team wins by 2 seconds."
"So, Jerry's rollin' a six-sided die. He's got 6 sides, right? And he's tryin' to figure out how much more likely he is to roll somethin' bigger than 3 compared to rollin' two even numbers in a row.

First, let's see how many numbers are bigger than 3. That's 4, 5, and 6. So, that's 3 numbers. And there's 6 total numbers on the die, so the chance of rollin' somethin' bigger than 3 is 3/6, which is 1/2 or 50%.

Now, let's see how many even numbers are on the die. That's 2, 4, and 6. So, that's 3 numbers. And again, there's 6 total numbers on the die, so the chance of rollin' two even numbers in a row is (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36, which is 1/9 or about 11.11%.

So, the difference is 50% - 11.11% = 38.89%. That's how much more likely Jerry is to roll somethin' bigger than 3 compared to rollin' two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 38.89%"
"So, Jenna and her mom picked apples from their farm. Her mom got 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. That means Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom. So, 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is 30."
"So, there's this pet store and they got rats and hamsters and rabbits. The rats are in groups of 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 straws. The hamsters are alone, and each hamster gets 5 straws. The rabbits got 20 straws all to themselves. 

We know the total number of straws used is 160. We also know the hamsters used 50 straws and the rabbits used 20 straws. So, the rats used 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 straws.

Now, we know the rats used 90 straws and each rat got 6 straws. To find out how many rats there are, we divide 90 by 6, which is 15. Since the rats are in groups of 3 cages, we divide 15 by 3, which is 5.

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is 5."
"So, Mandy owes Benedict some money, like $100. They said they would pay some extra, like 2% every month. Mandy paid it after 3 months, so we gotta figure out how much she owes now.

First, we gotta find out how much extra she owes each month. That's 2% of $100, which is $2. Then, we multiply that by 3, 'cause she paid it for 3 months. That's $2 * 3 = $6.

Now, we add that to the original $100. So, $100 + $6 = $106. That's how much Mandy owes now.

The final answer is: $106"
"So, there's this fella who buys wheat from a farmer. He pays $20 per bag and it costs $2 to move each bag to the warehouse. He makes a profit of $400 after sellin' the bags for $30 each. We gotta figure out how many bags he sold.

Let's say he bought x bags. The money he made from sellin' the bags is 30x. The money he spent on buyin' the bags and movin' 'em is 20x + 2x, which is 22x. The difference between the money he made and the money he spent is his profit, which is $400. So we set up the equation: 30x - 22x = 400.

Simplifying that, we get 8x = 400. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 50. That means he bought 50 bags. Since he sold 'em for $30 each, he made 50 * 30 = $1500. But we know he made a profit of $400, so he must've bought the bags for $1100. That's right, 1500 - 1100 = 400.

The answer is 50."
"So, three friends went to the fair and spent some money. They bought 3 tickets for $20.25. Then they bought food for $4.50 less than the tickets. That means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

They also went on two rides that cost $33 each. So, the rides cost 2 x $33 = $66.

Now, we gotta add all the costs together. $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

They said they would split the costs evenly, so we gotta divide $102 by 3. $102 ÷ 3 = $34.

The answer is: $34"
"So, John collects peaches for 3 hours. He can collect 2 peaches a minute. We gotta figure out how many peaches he gets in 3 hours. 

First, we gotta know how many minutes are in 3 hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Now, we multiply 180 minutes by 2 peaches a minute. That's 180 x 2 = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

**The answer is 360.**"
"So, we got a bunch of ducks and they need some bugs to eat. They need 3.5 pounds of bugs a week. We gotta figure out how many bugs they need each day. There's 7 days in a week, so we divide 3.5 by 7.

3.5 ÷ 7 = 0.5

So, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of bugs a day."
"So, Tom plants 10 trees a year. He plants 10 trees for 10 years, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees. Then, he chops down 2 trees a year for 10 years, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. 

Now, he has 100 trees and 20 trees are gone, so he has 100 - 20 = 80 trees. Then, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 80 is 0.3 * 80 = 24 trees. So, 24 trees die. 

Now, he has 80 trees and 24 trees die, so he has 80 - 24 = 56 trees.

The final answer is 56."
"So, there's this lady Sue, and her neighbors did somethin' funny to her. They put 18 pink flamingos in her yard on Friday mornin'. Then, on Saturday, they took back 1/3 of 'em, painted 'em white, and put 'em back out. That's like, 6 flamingos. Now, there's 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

After that, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there's 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos. And they still got 6 white flamingos.

Now, we gotta figure out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. We do that by subtractin' the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is 24."
"So, Violetta wanna buy some crayons, huh? She needs 5 of 'em, and they cost 2 bucks each. She's got 20 bucks. 

First, we gotta find out how much the crayons cost in total. We do that by multiplyin' the number of crayons by the price of each one. So, 5 * 2 = 10. That's how much the crayons cost.

Now, we gotta find out how much change Violetta's gonna get. We do that by subtractin' the cost of the crayons from the money she's got. So, 20 - 10 = 10. That's how much change she's gonna get.

The final answer is: $10"
"So, I gotta figure out how much a pen costs. I know a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, I add 'em together to get the cost of a pen. 

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, I gotta know how much 8 pens cost. I multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

So, 8 pens cost $12.00."
"So, we got 200 pounds of carrots and we wanna give 2 pounds to each of 40 restaurants. To find out how many carrots we got left, we gotta do some math.

First, we multiply 40 restaurants by 2 pounds, which is 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. That's how many carrots we gave away.

Now, we subtract 80 pounds from 200 pounds. That's 200 - 80 = 120 pounds. So, we got 120 pounds of carrots left.

The answer is 120."
"So, we gotta figure out how many kids there are in Soda. We know there's 23786 people total, and 8417 are men and 9092 are women. We need to find out how many are left over.

Let's see... if we add the men and women together, that's 8417 + 9092 = 17509. But we can't have that many people, 'cause there's only 23786 total. So, we gotta subtract 17509 from 23786 to find out how many kids there are.

23786 - 17509 = 6277

There's 6277 kids in Soda."
"So, Elaine had 20 pokemon cards at first. Then she got 3 times that many, which is 3 x 20 = 60. That's a lot of cards!

In the second month, she got 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. That's still a lot of cards!

In the third month, she got twice as many cards as the first two months, so she got 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards. That's a whole lotta cards!

Now, let's add 'em all up: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards. That's the total number of cards Elaine has now.

The answer is: 320"
"So, there's this guy Mark, and he edits sentences for two different publishers. He edits the same number of sentences for both, and that's 1000 sentences. He gets paid different amounts for each one. One pays him 5 cents per sentence, and the other pays him twice that amount.

Let's figure out how much he gets from the one that pays 5 cents. He edits 500 sentences for that one, so he gets:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

The other one pays twice as much, so he gets:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

Now, let's add those two amounts together to see how much he makes in a week:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents a week."
"So, Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Each pail has 5 liters of water in it. 

To find out how much water he gets in a day, we gotta add the water he gets in the morning and the water he gets in the afternoon. 

Morning water: 5 pails * 5 liters = 25 liters
Afternoon water: 6 pails * 5 liters = 30 liters

Now, we add 'em together: 25 + 30 = 55 liters

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

The final answer is 55."
"So, John gets a big award at work. It's worth $5000. He gets a raise too, but it's not like a raise where he gets more money every week. It's just a one-time thing. He makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, let's see how much he makes in a year without the award.

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Then, he gets the $5000 award. So, we add that to his yearly earnings:
$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

That's how much John makes in a year.

Final answer: $105,000"
"So, there's this lady named Josie, and she's got a farm. It's 10 acres big. Each acre makes 5 tons of grapes. And each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, if we multiply the acres by the tons, we get 10 * 5 = 50 tons. Then we multiply that by 2, 'cause each ton makes 2 barrels, so 50 * 2 = 100 barrels. That's how many barrels of wine she makes."
"So Carl likes cheese a lot, right? He eats a sandwich every day for lunch and uses 2 slices of cheese on each one. That's 2 * 7 = 14 slices for lunch.

He also eats cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days a week. He uses one more slice of cheese per omelet than he does per sandwich, so he uses 3 slices per omelet. That's 3 * 3 = 9 slices for breakfast.

And then he makes a big ol' dish of macaroni and cheese that uses 8 slices of cheese.

So, let's add 'em all up: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is 31."
"So, Janet had some pens. She had green ones and yellow ones. Then she bought some more pens. There were blue ones and red ones. I counted 'em.

She had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens. Each bag had 9 pens, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens. Each bag had 6 pens, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's count all the pens: 22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens."
"So, there's this girl Brinley, and she's in a math class. Her teacher, Mr. Bert, gives 'em six tests. She can get rid of the lowest score each time. She got 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. We need to figure out what she needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

First, we add up all the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. Now, we gotta get rid of the lowest score, which is 71. So, we subtract 71 from 438: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we need to find out what the total score should be for six tests to get an average of 93. We multiply 93 by 6: 93 * 6 = 558. Then, we subtract 367 from 558: 558 - 367 = 191.

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"So, Micheal likes ridin' his bike a lot. He rode it a lot in the first part, like, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. That's a lotta times, 5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times. And he rode 25 kilometers each time, so 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.

Then, he decided to ride it less, but farther, 2 times a week for 3 weeks. That's 2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times. And he rode 60 kilometers each time, so 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers he rode is 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"So, there's this bag of Halloween candy. It's got 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. The chocolate bars weigh twice as much as the apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. 

First, we gotta find out how much the chocolate bars weigh. We got 25 of 'em, and each one's 40 grams. So, we multiply 25 by 40, and that's 1000 grams.

Now, we gotta figure out how much the apples weigh. The chocolate bars weigh twice as much as the apples, so the apples weigh half as much as the chocolate bars. That means each apple weighs 40 grams divided by 2, which is 20 grams. We got 80 apples, so we multiply 80 by 20, and that's 1600 grams.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the apples together. That's 1000 grams plus 1600 grams, which is 2600 grams.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"So, Rose went to the store on Monday and bought some cakes. Then she went to another store on Tuesday and bought a lot more cakes. And on Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought even more cakes.

Let's see... On Monday, she bought 4 cakes. Then on Tuesday, she bought 3 times that number, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes. And on Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add 'em up: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days.

The final answer is 76."
"So, we got this thing where twenty dozen cups cost less than half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is like, three plates, right? And each plate costs six hundred dollars. So, three plates would be three times six hundred, which is one thousand eight hundred dollars.

Now, we gotta figure out how much twenty dozen cups cost. We know it's less than a thousand eight hundred dollars. Twenty dozen cups is like, twenty times twelve, which is two hundred and forty cups. So, we gotta find out how much two hundred and forty cups cost.

Let's do the math. Two thousand eight hundred dollars minus one thousand two hundred dollars is one thousand nine hundred dollars. That's how much twenty dozen cups cost.

Now, we gotta find out how much each cup costs. We got two thousand nine hundred dollars for two hundred and forty cups. So, we divide two thousand nine hundred by two hundred and forty. That's seven dollars and fifty cents per cup.

The final answer is: $7.50"
"So, Sara wanna buy a jacket and some shoes. The jacket costs 30 bucks and the shoes cost 20 bucks each. That's a total of 30 + 20 x 2 = 70 bucks. She already has 10 bucks saved up, so she needs 70 - 10 = 60 more.

She makes 5 bucks for babysitting and 4 bucks for mowing the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we gotta divide 60 by 4. That's 60 / 4 = 15.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 15"
"So, Jerry's got chickens, right? And they lay eggs. Some of 'em are red, some are white. The red ones lay 3 eggs a day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. And he's got two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r'. Then, the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'. We know that the total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

This means 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combining like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

So, Jerry's got 4 red chickens.

The answer is 4."
"So, there's this park thingy that's like, a rectangle, right? It's 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide. Gary likes to walk around it. He walks pretty fast, 3 miles per hour. We need to figure out how long it takes him to walk around it.

To do that, we gotta find the whole distance he walks. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides. There's two 1.5 mile sides and two 6 mile sides. So, that's 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles.

Now, we gotta divide that by how fast he walks, which is 3 miles per hour. So, 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there's this lady named Sloane, and she's countin' customers at the dollar store. On the first day, she sees 100 people. Then, the next day, she sees 50 more people than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 people.

Now, we gotta figure out how many people she saw on the third day. We know that the total number of people she saw on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250. And we know that the total number of people she saw on the third day is 500.

To find out how many people she saw on the third day, we gotta subtract the total number of people she saw on the first two days from the total number of people she saw on the third day. That's 500 - 250 = 250.

So, Sloane saw 250 people on the third day.

250"
"So, there's this big pool and a small pool, and they both leak water. The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative.

"So, Lori wanna buy some shoes and a belt, and they cost a total of $352.00. She makes 8 bucks an hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we gotta divide the cost by her hourly wage.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

Final answer: 44"
"So Janeth borrowed $2000 and she's gonna pay it back with some extra money. The extra money is 10% of the $2000. To find 10% of $2000, I think I need to multiply it by 0.1. That's right, 0.1 x $2000 = $200. So the total amount she needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She's gonna pay $165 a month for 12 months. I think I can find out how much she'll pay in total by multiplying $165 by 12. That's $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, I need to find out how much she still owes. To do that, I'll subtract $1980 from $2200. That's $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"So, there's 4 roses in the vase. And there's 7 more dahlias than roses. That means there's 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

So, we gotta add 'em together. 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers."
"So, there's this Harriet lady, she's 21 years old right now. And she's half the age of this other guy, Zack. That means Zack's 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Now, there's this other guy, Adrian. He's three times the age of Harriet, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, they'll all be older. Harriet'll be 21 + 3 = 24 years old, Zack'll be 42 + 3 = 45 years old, and Adrian'll be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average, we add 'em up and divide by 3. That's 24 + 45 + 66 = 135. Then we divide by 3, and that's 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"So, there's this game where four students scored a bunch of points. Naomi got 68 points. Then there's Yuri, and he got 10 more than half of what Naomi got. Half of Naomi's points is 68 divided by 2, which is 34. Yuri got 34 + 10, which is 44 points.

Now, there's Brianna, and she got 17 more points than Naomi. Naomi got 68, so Brianna got 68 + 17, which is 85 points.

We add up the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. That's the total points for those three. To find out how many points Jojo got, we subtract 197 from the total points, which is 251. So, 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."
"So, there's this lady named Carmen, and she's doin' these puzzles. She finishes a crossword puzzle in 10 minutes, and a sudoku puzzle in 5 minutes. She did 3 crosswords and 8 sudokus over the weekend.

First, let's do the crosswords. She did 3 of 'em, so that's 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes. Then, she did 8 sudokus, so that's 8 * 5 minutes = 40 minutes. Now, we add those two numbers together: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes doin' puzzles."
"So, there's this water tank thingy, right? It's got 120 liters of water in it. Then, some lady named Celine takes 90 liters out. That leaves 30 liters. 

After that, she gets some rainwater, and it's twice as much as what's left. So, she gets 2 x 30 = 60 liters of rainwater. Now, she adds that to the 30 liters she had left. That's 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

So, there's 90 liters of water in the tank now.

"So, there's this fella named Andy, and he plants a bunch of geraniums. He plants 90 of 'em. Then, he plants some petunias, but not as many as geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, if he plants 90 geraniums, that means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, to find out how many flowers he plants in total, we just add the number of geraniums and petunias. That's 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.

The final answer is: 140"
"So, there's this company that spends a lot of money on ads. They spend $15,000 on ads for one year. Then, they spend a third of that amount on ads for another year. I think a third of $15,000 is $5,000. So, they spend $5,000 on ads for the second year.

To find the total amount they spent on ads for the two years, I just add the two amounts together: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

The answer is: $20,000"
"So, Carlos and Benji are at the beach, right? They rent stuff. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.

To figure out how much they pay, we gotta multiply the hours they use the stuff by the price. For Carlos, that's 3 hours * $30/hour, which is... um... 3 * 30 = 90. And for Benji, it's 5 hours * $18/hour, which is... 5 * 18 = 90.

So, we add those two numbers together: 90 + 90 = 180. That's how much they pay in total.

The final answer is: $180"
"So, there's this guy Andrew, and he's plannin' a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. He's gonna take the bus, and it takes him 6 days to get there. Now, he's also gonna take a car to come back, and it's gonna take him half the time it took him to get there, which is 6 days. Half of 6 is 3, so the car trip's gonna take him 3 days.

So, the total number of days for the whole trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days."
"So, James has some Pokémon cards, right? He's got 30 fire ones, 20 grass ones, and 40 water ones. Then he loses 8 water ones, so he's got 40 - 8 = 32 water ones left. He buys 14 more grass ones, so now he's got 20 + 14 = 34 grass ones.

Now, let's count all the cards he's got. He's got 30 fire ones, 34 grass ones, and 32 water ones. That's 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards in total.

To find out what percentage of cards are water ones, we need to divide the number of water ones by the total number of cards, then multiply by 100. So, 32 water ones divided by 96 total cards is 32/96. Multiply that by 100, and we get 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, that's 33%.

So, the answer is 33%."

$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So Chad owes $9.00."
"So, there's this lady named Kalinda, and she's workin' on a puzzle with her mom. The puzzle's got 360 pieces, and they're tryin' to figure out how long it'll take 'em to finish it. Kalinda can do 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can do half that, so she can do 2 pieces per minute.

So, together they can do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. Now, we gotta figure out how long it'll take 'em to do 360 pieces. We can do that by dividin' 360 by 6.

360 ÷ 6 = 60

There's 60 minutes in an hour, so it'll take 'em 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, there's this watermelon farm and they got 120 watermelons. Then, Ashlyn went there and took 36 of 'em. That's 30% of the watermelons. Now, she comes back two weeks later and takes 3/4 of the ones that's left. 

First, we gotta find out how many watermelons are left after she took 36. That's 120 - 36 = 84. 

Then, we gotta find out 3/4 of 84. That's 0.75 * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons are left. 

Now, we gotta find out how many watermelons are not left. That's 84 - 63 = 21. 

The answer is 21."
"So, Mark buys a bunch of cars, like 12 of 'em. Each one costs $20,000. He's gotta pay some tax on 'em, like 10% of the total price. That's $24,000. Then he's gotta pay another $1,000 for each car, so that's $12,000. 

So, let's add it all up: $20,000 * 12 = $240,000. Then, $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000. And then $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"So, Kylie and Robert go to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. That's 2 * 25 = 50 shells.

The answer is 50."
"So, there's this fella Dax, and he went to his farm to pick some apples. He found some bugs and ants in the garden. There's more ants than bugs, but not twice as many. There's half as many bugs as ants. If there's 50 ants, how many bugs are there?

Let's see... if there's half as many bugs as ants, we gotta divide the number of ants by 2. So, 50 ants divided by 2 is... 25 bugs.

Now, we gotta add the bugs and ants together to get the total number of insects. That's 50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects.

The answer is 75."
"So, there's 36 penguins, and they're all sunbathing in the snow. Then, one-third of 'em jump in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave. I'm not really sure what they do in the cave, but I guess they're eating dinner or something.

So, one-third of 36 is 12, and that's how many penguins jumped in the ocean. And another 12 penguins went inside the cave. That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 penguins that left sunbathing.

Now, to find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, I just subtract 24 from 36. That's 36 - 24 = 12.

So, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

The answer is: 12"
"So, there's this fella Steve, and he's tryin' to grow some tomatoes. He eats a lot, like, twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 tomatoes a day. That's a lotta tomatoes!

So, if he eats 6 a day, that's 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes a week. His girlfriend eats half that, so she eats 21 tomatoes a week.

Now, we gotta figure out how many vines he needs to grow tomatoes. Each vine makes 3 tomatoes a week. So, we gotta divide 42 by 3 to see how many vines he needs.

42 ÷ 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to grow enough tomatoes for him and his girlfriend.

Final answer: 14"
"So, John's got a bunch of friends comin' over and he wants to make sure they all get some pizza. There's 20 friends, and he wants each one to have 4 slices. But pizzas are cut into 8 slices, so we gotta figure out how many pizzas he needs.

Let's see... if he's gotta give each of the 20 friends 4 slices, that's 20 x 4 = 80 slices. Now, we gotta divide that by 8, 'cause that's how many slices are on each pizza. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"So, Ram buys 25 pens. He can make a new pen from 5 empty pens. We need to figure out how many pens he can make from 25 pens.

Let's see... if he can make one pen from 5 empty pens, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many pens he can make.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens. He won't have any empty pens left. He'll have 5 full pens.

The answer is 5."
"So, Johnny had some money, like $20, and then he got some more, $10. That's $20 + $10, which is $30. Then, this $30 got tripled, which means it got multiplied by 3. So, we gotta multiply $30 by 3. That's $30 * 3 = $90."
"So, there's this girl Jessa, and she's 20 years old. Then there's Joan, and she's 5 years older than Jessa, so she's 20 + 5 = 25 years old. And then there's Mary, and she's 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68."
"So, there's this big hall with 1000 students. They all go out, but not all at the same time. 

First, 30% of the students leave through one door. That's 30% of 1000, which is 300 students. Now, there's 1000 - 300 = 700 students left.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students leave through another door. That's 3/5 * 700 = 420 students. Now, there's 700 - 420 = 280 students left.

The last 280 students leave through the last door. That's the answer."
"So, there's this guy James and he's got some candies. And then there's this other guy Robert, and he's got some too. And then there's John, and he's got a whole lotta candies. 

We know John's got 54 candies, and he's got twice as many as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert's got, we gotta divide John's candies by 2. That's 54 / 2 = 27. So Robert's got 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John's got than James, we just subtract James' candies from John's candies. That's 54 - 33 = 21.

The answer is 21."
"So, Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one. They read each other's books too. That means Dolly reads her own two books, Pandora's one book, and Pandora reads Dolly's two books. So, Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books, and Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, they read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

The answer is 6."
"So, Mike had 5 penpals, but he stopped bein' friends with 2 of 'em. That means he's left with 3 penpals. They all send 2 letters a week, and Mike sends 2 letters back. So, he gets 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week, and he sends 6 letters a week too. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages a week. He can write a page in 6 minutes, so he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes a week writin'.

There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta divide 360 by 60 to find out how many hours he spends writin'. That's 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Jason has a phone plan that's 1000 minutes long. He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, and he's had some extra minutes to talk to other people. This month has 30 days.

First, let's see how many minutes Jason talks to his boss. He talks to his boss 15 minutes a day for 30 days, so that's:
15 * 30 = 450 minutes

He also had some extra minutes to talk to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total minutes he used is:
450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Now, we need to see how many minutes he has left. He had 1000 minutes in his plan, and he used 750 minutes. So, he has:
1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left

The answer is 250."
"So, there's this guy Griffin, and he had 24 french fries. Then, this other guy Kyle took 5 of 'em. That leaves Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, this Billy guy takes twice as many fries as Kyle, so he takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin's left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Then, there's this Ginger lady, and she gives Griffin some fries. Let's say she gives him x fries. After that, Griffin's got 9 + x fries.

Now, this Colby guy takes 3 less fries than Kyle, so he takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. That means Griffin's left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin's got 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we just subtract 7 from both sides: x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, there's this thing about snails and fish. There's 4 snails in one tank and 32 snails in another tank. The difference between the snails is twice the number of fish in both tanks. And they both have the same number of fish.

Let's say the number of fish in each tank is x. Since they have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the snails is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. This difference is twice the number of fish, so we can say 28 = 2x.

To find the number of fish, we need to divide 28 by 2. That's 28 ÷ 2 = 14.

So, there's 14 fish in each tank.

Final answer: 14"
"So, there's this lady, and she's a makeup artist, right? She charges $250 an hour. She works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, and she does that for 5 whole weeks. That's a lot of work!

First, we gotta figure out how many hours she works in total. She works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 hours a week. She does that for 5 weeks, so that's 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

Now, we gotta figure out how much she charges for all those hours. She charges $250 an hour, so 120 hours would be 120 * 250 = $30,000.

But, she gives a 10% discount because she worked so much. 10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000. So, we gotta subtract that from the total.

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"So, Isabelle bought some stuff for her sister's birthday party. She spent a lot on cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. Let's add it all up:

Cake: $12
Presents: $43
Decorations: $15
Invitations: $4
Goodie bags: $22

Total cost: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Now, she's gonna split it with her two parents. There's 3 people in total. To find out how much each person pays, we gotta divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32."
"So, the chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions cost $1.50. We gotta figure out how much the chef spent.

First, we gotta multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag. That's 4 bags times 50 pounds. That's 200 pounds. Now we gotta multiply that by the cost per pound, which is $1.50. So, 200 times $1.50 is $300.

The chef spent $300."
"So, there's this lady Sue and her sister. They ate cookies, and I'm gonna figure out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister.

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. That's a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Now, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. And on Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. That's a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies for Sue.

Now, let's talk about calories. One cookie has 200 calories. So, Sue ate 46 cookies, which is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 cookies, which is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister, we subtract 3600 from 9200. That's 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is 5600."
"So, there's this school with 3 classes. Each class has 20 students. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls. 

We know the first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. We need to find out how many girls are in the third class. 

Let's see... if the school is 50% girls, that means 50% of the students are girls. Since there are 3 classes, we gotta find 50% of 3 classes. That's 1.5 classes. 

Now, we know 1.5 classes is 30 girls. We already know 15 girls are in the first class and 12 girls are in the second class. So, the third class has 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the school is 50% boys. That means 50% of the students are boys. The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

We know the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys. So, the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"So, Travis had some apps on his tablet. He got rid of some and then got some more. Let's see... He had 61 apps to start with. Then he deleted 9, and then he got 18 more. To find out how many apps he has now, we gotta do some math.

First, we subtract the apps he deleted from the ones he had: 61 - 9 = 52. Then we add the new apps he got: 52 + 18 = 70.

So, Travis has 70 apps on his tablet now."
"So, Rick killed a bunch of animals last night. He killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Then, he went out and killed some more animals today. He killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and three fewer cougars than the night before.

Let's see... if he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 15 cougars, that means he killed 3 x 15 = 45 wolves. And if he killed three fewer cougars than the night before, that means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed. He killed 10 wolves last night, and 45 wolves today, so that's 10 + 45 = 55 wolves. And he killed 15 cougars last night, and 12 cougars today, so that's 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

So, in total, Rick killed 55 wolves and 27 cougars. That's 55 + 27 = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"
"So, Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. I think I figured it out. 

To find the floor he's on now, I just did some math. I multiplied 3 by 4, which is 12, and then I added 6. That's 12 + 6, which is 18. So, Bill is on the 18th floor."
"So, there's this water park thingy where Shelly's kids went. There's Mitchel, and he went down the slide 30 times. Then there's Anne, and she went down the slide less than Mitchel. We gotta figure out how much less. I think it's 30% less. So, we gotta find 30% of 30. That's 0.3 * 30 = 9. Now, we subtract that from 30, and Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, there's Robert, and he went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply 21 by 4, and that's 84. That's how many times Robert went down the slide.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there's this fella Mr. Sylas, and he buys a bunch of cows. He puts 'em all in 10 stalls, and each stall already had 20 cows. Then he buys 40 more cows. He puts 'em all in the 10 stalls. Now we wanna know how many cows are in 8 of those stalls.

First, we gotta figure out how many cows are in each stall now. We take the 20 cows that were already there, and add the 40 new cows. That's 60 cows in total. Then we divide that by 10 stalls, and we get 6 cows per stall.

Now we wanna know how many cows are in 8 of those stalls. We take the 6 cows per stall, and multiply that by 8. That's 48 cows.

The final answer is 48."
"So, there's this fella named Brady and he's countin' his money in his piggy bank. He's got a bunch of different kinds of coins and some dollar bills. Let's see how much he's got.

He's got 100 pennies, which is like, a lot of pennies. That's 100 pennies, so that's 100 cents, or $1. Then he's got 40 nickels, which is 40 x 5 cents, or $2. Then he's got 20 dimes, which is 20 x 10 cents, or $2. And he's also got 40 dollar bills, which is just 40 dollars.

Now, let's add 'em all up. We got $1 + $2 + $2 + $40. That's a lotta money! So, Brady's got a total of $45.

$45"
"So, we got a big ol' redwood tree that's 200 feet tall. Each 10-foot section of it weighs 400 pounds. We gotta figure out how much the whole thing weighs.

First, we gotta find out how many 10-foot sections there are in that tree. We do that by dividin' the height by 10:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we gotta find out how much wood the termites ate. They ate 30% of the wood. That's like, three-tenths of the whole thing. So we multiply the total weight by 0.3:

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that the termites ate from the total weight of the tree to find the weight of the wood that's left:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"So, there's this lady named Nancy, and she's gotta pay for some books she's been keepin' at the library too long. She owes 50 cents for each of 8 books, and there's a flat fee of 2 bucks for one of 'em bein' overdue for more than a week.

First, let's figure out how much she owes for the books. We gotta multiply 8 books by 50 cents, which is 8 x 0.50 = 4 bucks. Then, we gotta add the 2 bucks for the late fee. So, 4 bucks + 2 bucks = 6 bucks.

The answer is: $6"
"So, there's this guy Andrea and he's got 52 apples. He's got 8 more apples than this other guy Jamal. So, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, Jamal's got 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea's got half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's got 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

So, Andrea's got 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal's got 44 apples and 48 bananas. Let's count 'em up: Andrea's got 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal's got 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"So, Carla's makin' a bunch of cookies, right? She's makin' 36 today and 30 tomorrow. We need to figure out how much flour she needs. 

First, we gotta add the number of cookies she's makin' today and tomorrow. That's 36 + 30 = 66 cookies. Now, we gotta divide that by 12, 'cause 2 cups of flour is needed for a dozen cookies. 

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5. So, Carla needs 5.5 cups of flour."
"So, there's this cup with 9,300 pennies in it. We need to find out how much money that is if we take two thirds of the pennies. 

To do that, we gotta divide 9,300 by 3, 'cause two thirds is the same as 2/3. 

9,300 ÷ 3 = 3,100

Now, we multiply that by 2, 'cause we want two thirds. 

3,100 * 2 = 6,200

Each penny is worth a little bit, like 1 cent. So we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 (which is the same as 1/100).

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

So, there's 62 dollars in two thirds of the pennies.

The final answer is 62."
"So, Maddison got 5 boxes of marbles, and each box had 50 marbles. That's a lotta marbles! Let's see... if she got 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each, that's like... um... 5 x 50 = 250 marbles. Then she got 20 more marbles from her friend. So, we gotta add those 20 to the 250. That's 250 + 20 = 270 marbles. She's got 270 marbles now.

The final answer is: 270"
"So, there's this guy Chris and he's got 6 trees in his yard. Then there's this other guy Ferdinand and he's got half the trees Chris has, so Ferdinand's got 3 trees. Now, there's this other guy Harry and he's got 5 more than twice the trees Ferdinand's got, so Harry's got 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees Harry's got than Ferdinand's, we gotta subtract Ferdinand's trees from Harry's trees. That's 11 - 3 = 8.

The answer is 8."
"So, there's this lady Carmen, she's got $100. Then there's this other lady Samantha, she's got $25 more than Carmen, so she's got $100 + $25 = $125. And then there's this other lady Daisy, she's got $50 more than Samantha, so she's got $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add 'em up: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"So, Mrs. Cruz is lookin' for a house that won't cost her more than $400,000. She saw a place that's sellin' for $350,000. There's also some extra fees she gotta pay. The first one is a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the sellin' price. That's 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. Then there's a transfer fee, which is 12% of the sellin' price. That's 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

So, the total of them fees is $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Now, we add that to the sellin' price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, so we gotta find out how much more the house costs than that. That's $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The answer is: $9,500"
"So, Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He paid some money for transfer fees and a brokerage fee. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, and the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. 

First, we need to find out how much he paid for the transfer fees. 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000. Then, we need to find out how much he paid for the brokerage fee. 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000. 

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee together. $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. This is the total amount he paid. 

To find the net proceeds, we need to subtract the total amount paid from the selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. 

The final answer is: $32,000"
"So, we gotta figure out how long it takes to get the oil hot and then cook the chicken. 

First, it takes 20 minutes to get the oil hot. Then, it takes 40% longer than that to get it to 400 degrees. That's 20 + 8 = 28 minutes. 

Now, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat up the oil. So, that's 20 - 5 = 15 minutes.

So, the total time is 28 + 15 = 43 minutes.

The final answer is: 43"
"So, there's this real estate guy, and he's spendin' money on ads. He's spendin' $5 on each newspaper ad, and $75 on each TV ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 TV ads. 

To find out how much he spent on newspaper ads, I just multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads. So, $5 * 50 is $250. 

Then, I do the same thing for the TV ads. $75 * 15 is $1125. 

Now, I add those two numbers together to find the total amount he spent. $250 + $1125 is $1375. 

The answer is $1375."
"So, there's this juggler, right? And they got 16 balls. Half of 'em are golf balls, and half of those are blue. I'm thinkin', if half of 16 is 8, and half of 8 is 4, then there's 4 blue golf balls.

The answer is 4."
"So, Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, and the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had.

Let's figure out how many M&Ms Mary got. We gotta count 'em up!

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more, so it's 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the M&Ms of the first bag, so it's 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add 'em up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

The answer is: 762"
"So, there's this guy John and he got 2 houses. Each house got 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom got 2 windows. That's 3 * 2 = 6 windows in each house. Then, there's 4 more windows in each house that ain't in the bedrooms. That's 4 * 2 = 8 windows. 

So, we gotta add those together: 6 + 8 = 14 windows in one house. Since there's 2 houses, we multiply that by 2: 14 * 2 = 28 windows.

The final answer is: 28"
"So, the lady went shopping and bought some stuff. She bought cocoa for $4.20, laundry for $9.45, and pasta for $1.35. She paid with $20. 

First, we gotta add up the prices of the stuff she bought. 

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounding to nearest cent) = $15.99

Now, we gotta find out how much change she gets. We take the $20 she paid and subtract the total cost. 

$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

So, the lady gets $4.01 in change."
"So, there's this lady, Terri, and she's makin' a sweater. It's got two sleeves, a collar, and a fancy thingy called a rosette. The part of the sweater that's the body takes 900 stitches to finish. The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. And the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 180 stitches.

Now, we gotta figure out how many stitches each sleeve takes. We know the whole sweater is 1800 stitches. We also know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches.

So, we subtract the body, collar, and rosette stitches from the total number of stitches for the whole sweater. That's 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches left for the two sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we gotta divide the stitches by 2. That's 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"So, Mrs. Rylan bought some seeds. She got 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds. Tomato seeds cost $40 each and celery seeds cost $30 each. To find out how much she spent, I added the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.

First, I multiplied the number of packets of tomato seeds by the cost of each packet: 20 * $40 = $800. Then, I multiplied the number of packets of celery seeds by the cost of each packet: 80 * $30 = $2400. 

Now, I added the two amounts together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"So, there's this guy Sean, and he's practicin' for a play. He's gotta remember some lines for two scenes and a song. The song's got 54 lines. 

The first scene's got twice as many lines as the song, so that's 2 x 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of those are Sean's lines, so he's gotta remember 108 / 3 = 36 lines from that scene.

The second scene's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of those are Sean's lines, so he's gotta remember 60 x 4/5 = 48 lines from that scene.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines. So, Sean's gotta remember 138 lines in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"So, there's this lady Carly and she had 80 cards. Some of 'em had the letter A on 'em, some had the letter B, some had the letter C, and the rest had the letter D. 

First, we gotta figure out how many cards had the letter A on 'em. We do that by takin' 2/5 of 80. That's like, 2 outta 5, so we multiply 80 by 2 and then divide by 5. That gives us 32 cards with the letter A.

Now, we gotta take away them A cards from the total. So, we subtract 32 from 80, and that leaves us with 48 cards. 

Next, we gotta figure out how many of them 48 cards had the letter B. We do that by takin' 1/2 of 48. That's like, half of 48, so we multiply 48 by 1 and divide by 2. That gives us 24 cards with the letter B.

Now, we gotta take away them B cards from the 48. So, we subtract 24 from 48, and that leaves us with 24 cards. 

Then, we gotta figure out how many of them 24 cards had the letter C. We do that by takin' 5/8 of 24. That's like, 5 outta 8, so we multiply 24 by 5 and divide by 8. That gives us 15 cards with the letter C.

Finally, we gotta take away them C cards from the 24. So, we subtract 15 from 24, and that leaves us with 9 cards. And them 9 cards musta had the letter D.

The answer is 9."
"So, there's this guy Matthew, and he's diggin' holes for shrubs and trees. It takes him 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs, and 10 minutes to dig a big hole for trees. We need to figure out how long it'll take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 big holes.

First, let's do the small holes. He's diggin' 30 of 'em, and it takes 3 minutes each. So, that's 30 x 3 = 90 minutes. That's a lotta minutes!

Now, let's do the big holes. He's diggin' 15 of 'em, and it takes 10 minutes each. So, that's 15 x 10 = 150 minutes. That's even more minutes!

Now, we add 'em together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes. That's a lot of minutes, but we need to convert it to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 by 60. That's 4 hours.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Mico and Marco wanna know each other, huh? They found out that when they add up their ages, it's 20. That's cool, I guess.

Now, they wanna know what their ages will be in 10 years. We need to figure that out. Let's say Mico's age is M and Marco's age is C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. When we add those up, we get M + C + 20. But we know M + C is 20, so we can just add 20 to that. That's 20 + 20 = 40.

So, in 10 years, Mico and Marco's ages will be 40."
"So, there's this girl Ruby and she's 6 times older than this other guy Sam. That means if Sam is x, Ruby is 6x. 

Now, let's say in 9 years, Ruby is 3 times as old as Sam. That means in 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 and Sam will be x + 9. We're told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write an equation: 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6x + 9 = 3x + 27. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 3x + 9 = 27. Then, subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3x = 18. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now."
"So, Peter bought some stuff. He got 20 popsicles and 4 ice cream bars. The popsicles cost 25 cents each and the ice cream bars cost 50 cents each. To find out how much he paid, I added the costs together.

First, I added 20 popsicles * 25 cents = 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars. Then I added 4 ice cream bars * 50 cents = 4 * 0.50 = 2 dollars. So, 5 + 2 = 7 dollars.

The final answer is: $7"
"So, we got two kinds of snakes, cobra and mamba. The cobra has 70 spots, and it's said that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. That means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

We got 40 cobras and 60 mambas. To find the total spots, we gotta multiply the spots on each snake by the number of snakes. For cobras, that's 40 * 70 = 2800. For mambas, that's 60 * 35 = 2100. Now, we add 'em together: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"So, Maddy's cousin's soccer game is gonna be big, huh? There's 12 team members, 3 coaches, and they're all bringin' their friends. I think there's 12 team members, 3 coaches, and 24 guests. That's a lotta people!

So, we gotta figure out how many pizzas Maddy needs. Each pizza can feed 3 people, so we gotta divide the total number of people by 3. That's 12 + 3 + 24, which is 39 people. Now, 39 divided by 3 is 13. So, Maddy needs 13 pizzas.

Now, let's see how much that's gonna cost. Each pizza costs $15. So, 13 pizzas will be 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"So, there's this lady named Katerina, and she makes jewelry. She likes makin' necklaces with topaz gemstones. She puts 8 of 'em in each necklace, and then she fills in the gaps with them silver beads. The thing is, them topaz gemstones are 1 inch long, and them silver beads are 1/4 inch long. And the necklace is 25 inches long.

First, we gotta figure out how much space is left between the gemstones. We take the length of the necklace, 25 inches, and subtract the length of the gemstones, 8 inches. That leaves us with 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, we gotta figure out how many silver beads fit in that space. We take the space, 17 inches, and divide it by the length of each silver bead, 1/4 inch. That's like, 17 x 4, 'cause you gotta multiply by 4 to get rid of the fraction. So, 17 x 4 = 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is 68."
"So, Alani's family had a thing where they wrote stories. Alani wrote 20 stories the first time, and then she wrote 20 x 2, which is 40, the second time. Her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories the first time, and then he wrote 40 x 2, which is 80, the second time. Her sister Margot wrote 60 stories the first time, and then she wrote 60 x 2, which is 120, the second time.

Now, let's add up all the stories. Alani wrote 20 + 40, which is 60. Braylen wrote 40 + 80, which is 120. Margot wrote 60 + 120, which is 180.

So, the total number of stories is 60 + 120 + 180. Let me do the math... 60 + 120 is 180, and 180 + 180 is 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"So, there's this girl named Ann, she's 9 years old. Her brother is twice her age, so he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old. Now, we gotta figure out how old he'll be in 3 years. We add 3 to his age, so 18 + 3 = 21."
"So, Kelly got 5 quarters and 2 dimes. I think that's like, 5 x 25 cents and 2 x 10 cents. That's 125 cents and 20 cents. Let's add 'em together: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, she buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much she got left, we gotta subtract 55 from 145. That's 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

So, Kelly got 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, there's this flag with 76 stars on it. It's got 3 rows of 8 stars, and 2 rows of 6 stars. The rest are 5-star rows. I counted the stars in the 8-star rows, that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Then I counted the stars in the 6-star rows, that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 

So, the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. Now, I need to find out how many 5-star rows there are. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, I subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Now, I need to find out how many 5-star rows there are. I divide the 40 stars by 5, and that's 40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"So, we got a bunch of flagstones that weigh 75 pounds each, and we need to figure out how many trucks we need to carry 'em. The trucks can only hold 2000 pounds, and we got 80 flagstones.

First, we gotta find out how much all the flagstones weigh together. We do that by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each one. So, 80 flagstones * 75 pounds = 6000 pounds.

Now, we gotta see how many trucks we need to carry 6000 pounds. We do that by dividing 6000 by 2000. That's 6000 / 2000 = 3.

So, we need 3 trucks to carry all the flagstones.

The answer is 3."
"So, we got two cars, one's goin' fast and one's goin' slow. The fast one's goin' 60 miles per hour, and the slow one's goin' half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. 

Now, we wanna know how long it took the slow one to go 480 miles. To figure that out, we gotta divide the distance by the speed. So, we do 480 miles divided by 30 miles per hour.

That's 480 ÷ 30 = 16 hours.

The answer is 16."
"So, there's this guy Ali, and he's super good at countin'. He's got 22 medals. His friend Izzy's also pretty good, but not as good as Ali. Izzy's got 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy's got 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Now, when they count together, they got 22 + 17 = 39 medals. But the thing is, there's more medals out there than that. Like, a lot more. They got 10 times more medals than Ali and Izzy got together. So, we gotta figure out how many medals are out there.

Let's call the number of medals out there ""x"". We know that 10 times that number is 39. So, we can set up an equation: 10x = 39. To find x, we divide both sides by 10: x = 39 ÷ 10 = 3.9.

Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""Is 3.9 a real number of medals?"" And I'm like, ""Yeah, I guess so."" But if you're thinkin' about it, it's kinda weird. You can't really have a fraction of a medal. But, I guess that's just how it is.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"So, we got 4 grown-ups and 8 little kids. They got 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 bars. That's a total of 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

The grown-ups get 6 bars each, so they take 4 * 6 = 24 bars. That leaves 40 - 24 = 16 bars for the kids.

There's 8 kids, and we wanna divide the 16 bars equally among them. So, each kid gets 16 / 8 = 2 bars.

The answer is 2."
"So, there's this lady named Susan, and she's doin' some online work. She gets paid $5 for every 10 minutes she works. She starts workin' at 8 in the mornin' and stops at 11, but she takes a break in the middle. That's like, half an hour, right? So, she's workin' for 3 hours, but she's only workin' for 2.5 hours 'cause of the break.

Now, let's figure out how many minutes she's workin'. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. But she takes a break, so we gotta subtract 30 minutes. That's 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

She gets paid $5 for every 10 minutes, so we gotta divide 150 by 10. That's 15. Now, we multiply 15 by $5. That's 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"So, there's this game thingy with three friends, Mike, Jim, and Tony. They play for a bit, and after three rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 42 points. Then, they play one more round, and everyone gets an extra point if they have more than 20 points. So, they all get an extra point, and now they have:

- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim has 18 + 1 = 19 points
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up all their points: 22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there's this fella named Will, and he buys 15 oranges. Then, he asks his two sons to wash some oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. That means the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son washed 8 oranges, and the youngest son washed 4 oranges. So, in total, they washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will had 15 oranges, and they washed 12, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"So, Darren is doin' some exercises, right? He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. Then, on the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, 10 fewer squats, and doubles the dumbbell presses.

Let's see how many pushups he does on the second day: 100 + 20 = 120. Then, he does 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40. And he doubles the dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, let's add up all the exercises: 100 + 120 = 220 pushups, 50 + 40 = 90 squats, and 20 + 40 = 60 dumbbell presses. So, the total count of exercises is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"So, we got a big bag of rice, 42 kg, and we wanna know how long it'll last. There's 5 people in the house, and they eat rice twice a day. That's 0.2 kg per person, twice a day, so that's 0.4 kg per person per day. And there's 5 people, so that's 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg per day.

Now, we got 7 days in a week, so we multiply 2 kg by 7, and that's 14 kg per week. We got 42 kg of rice, and we need to know how many weeks it'll last. So, we divide 42 by 14, and that's 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Sam sells bread, right? He wants to sell 120 crates in a week. But he's closed on Monday and Friday, and he sold some crates over the weekend. He sold 20 crates on Saturday and Sunday, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Let's add up the crates he sold: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates. He sold 65 crates in total.

Now, we need to find out how many crates he was short of his target. His target was 120 crates, so we need to subtract 65 from 120.

120 - 65 = 55

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target."
"So, there's this lady named Carmen, and she's at an auction. She starts with a bid of $200 for this old desk. Then, three other people bid on it, and their bids go up by $50 each time. Carmen bids after each of those three people, and she wins the desk.

The bids were $200, $250, $300, and $350. Carmen's bids were $200, $250, and $300. To find out how much she paid, we gotta add up all the bids. 

First, we add up the bids from the other three people: $50 + $50 + $50 = $150. Then, we add that to Carmen's last bid, which was $300. $300 + $150 = $450. But wait, we ain't done yet! We gotta add the cost of the desk itself, which is $200. $450 + $200 = $650.

So, Carmen paid $650 for the desk."
"So, John's work is 30 miles away and he goes there and back, so that's 60 miles a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 miles a week. He does that for 50 weeks, so that's 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles a year.

He gets charged $2 per mile, so that's 15,000 * 2 = $30,000 a year. Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus a month, so that's 150 * 12 = $1,800 a year. 

So, the total cost is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"So, Peter wants to exercise twice as long as he did on Monday and Sunday. He did 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday. We need to add those two numbers together to see how long he did in total.

23 + 16 = 39

Now, we need to multiply that by 2, 'cause he wants to do twice as long. 

39 x 2 = 78

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday."
"So, you wanna know how many pieces of paper you need for a 32-page tabloid. 

You fold the paper in half, and then you got two sides: left and right. The left side has 16 pages, and the right side has 16 pages too. That's 16 + 16 = 32 pages. But wait, you also got front and back. So, you need 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back for each side. That's 8 + 8 = 16 pages for the front and 8 + 8 = 16 pages for the back. 

So, you need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper."
"So Annika went to the town fair and she had $50. She spent half of it on food and stuff, and then she spent some more money on rides. I think she spent $25 on food and $10 on rides. That's a total of $35.

To find out how much she has left, I just subtract $35 from $50. That's $50 - $35 = $15.

So Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"So, Elise has a bunch of books, like, 250 of 'em. She's been sellin' 'em for three years now. She sells 'em for 20 bucks each. 

She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year. This year she sold 45 books. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

There's 50 books left unsold, and there's a total of 250 books. That means she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years.

We know she sold 90 books in the first year, so she musta sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20 bucks, so she made 110 * 20 = 2200 bucks in the second year.

The final answer is: $2200"
"So, Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week. He gets $10 an hour, so he makes 50 * 10 = $500 a week. He gets a $300 bonus for the whole month 'cause the company did good. So, he makes $500 + $300 = $800 a week. There's 4 weeks in April, so he makes 4 * $800 = $3200."
"So, John arm wrestles 20 people and he beats 80% of 'em. That means he beats 16 people. To find out how many he lost to, we gotta multiply 20 by 0.2. 

20 x 0.2 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"So, there's this bakery that makes 60 loaves of bread every day. They sell two-thirds of 'em in the morning. That's 40 loaves. Now, they got 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left. Then, they sell half of those 20 loaves in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 10. So, they sell 10 loaves in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, there's this guy Joey and he loses weight real fast. He loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. That's like, a lot of weight. Now, there's this other guy Sandy, and he wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, but he's not as fast. He needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

To figure out how many weeks it'll take Sandy, we gotta divide the weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the number of weeks it takes Sandy. So, we do 8 pounds / 4 weeks. That's 2 pounds per week.

Now, we know it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds. So, it's like, if he loses 2 pounds per week, it'll take him 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds. That's a lot of weeks.

The answer is 4."
"So, we got a tub of ice cream that's $13, but now it's $11. That's a discount of $2. We also got a packet of milk that's $0.50 cheaper. We need to buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

First, let's find out how much 2 tubs of ice cream cost at the old price: 2 x $13 = $26. Then, 4 packets of milk cost $0.50 each, so 4 x $0.50 = $2. So, the total cost at the old price is $26 + $2 = $28.

Now, let's find out how much 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk cost at the new price. 2 tubs of ice cream cost $11 each, so 2 x $11 = $22. 4 packets of milk cost $0.50 each, so 4 x $0.50 = $2. The total cost at the new price is $22 + $2 = $24.

To find out how much we save, we subtract the new price from the old price: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"So, there's this lady, Helena, and she's got this special drink that makes people grow extra arms and legs. It's like, every 3 days, they get an extra arm, and every 5 days, they get an extra leg. We wanna know how many new limbs they'll get after 15 days.

Let's see... if they get an extra arm every 3 days, that's 15 days / 3 days = 5 extra arms. That's a lot of arms!

And if they get an extra leg every 5 days, that's 15 days / 5 days = 3 extra legs. That's a lot of legs too!

So, if we add 'em up, they'll get 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. That's a total of 5 + 3 = 8 new limbs.

The answer is 8."
"So, there's this guy named Theo and he's goin' on a trip to South Africa. He's got $6000 to spend. He buys 6 business suits, and each one costs $100. That's 6 * $100 = $600. He also buys 3 suitcases, and each one costs $50. That's 3 * $50 = $150. 

Now, he's gotta buy a flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times the price of a business suit. So, 5 times the price of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. And $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200. 

So, the total cost of all the stuff he's bought so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. 

Now, he's got $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left. He wants to save $2000, so he's gotta spend $4050 - $2000 = $2050 on gifts for his business partners."
"So, there's this family with 5 people. Three of 'em eat 3 eggs a day, and the other two eat 2 eggs a day. They eat eggs every day, right?

Let's see... if three people eat 3 eggs a day, that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. And the other two people eat 2 eggs a day, that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs.

So, in total, they eat 9 + 4 = 13 eggs a day. Now, there's 7 days in a week, so we gotta multiply 13 by 7 to see how many eggs they eat in a week. That's 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The answer is 91."
"So, there's this guy Quinn, and he's 30 years old. Then there's Jane, and she's 3 years younger than Quinn, so she's 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so he's 27 + 5 = 32 years old."
"So, there's this fella Noah, and he's half as old as this other fella Cera. Cera's 46 now, so six years ago, Noah was half of that, which is 23. Now, we gotta figure out how old Noah is now. We do that by addin' 6 to 23, which is 29.

Now, we know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age back then. So, we multiply 3000 by 23, which is 69,000. That's the population six years ago.

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, we just gotta double it. So, we multiply 69,000 by 2, which is 138,000. That's the population of Chile now.

The final answer is: 138,000"
"So, there's this football team with 105 players. They got twice as many players on offense as they do on defense. That means if they got x players on defense, they got 2x players on offense. And they got half as many players on special teams as they do on defense, so they got x/2 players on special teams.

So, we gotta add up all the players: x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams). We know the total is 105, so we set it up like this:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To get rid of the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Now we combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there's 30 players on defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"So Martha's got a party and she invited a bunch of people. There's 2 families with 6 people in each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. And then there's 3 families with 4 people in each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But then some people can't come 'cause they're sick, so we gotta subtract 8. That leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, some people had other stuff they had to do, and that's 1/4 of 8 people. That's 8 / 4 = 2 people. We gotta subtract those too, so 16 - 2 = 14 people.

So, 14 people show up to Martha's party."
"So, Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. Then, his dad gave him some more marbles. His dad gave him 2/5 of the marbles he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his dad gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we gotta add the marbles he bought from Johanna to the ones his dad gave him, and the ones the store already had. That's 20 + 8 = 28 marbles. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 28 + 50 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. So, we gotta multiply the total number of marbles by 2. That's 78 * 2 = 156."
"So, we got a pool that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. We need to figure out how much it costs to fill it up. 

To do that, we gotta multiply the length, width, and height together. That's like, 6 times 4 times 5. 

6 * 4 = 24
24 * 5 = 120

So, the pool is 120 cubic feet. Now, we gotta pay $.1 for every cubic foot. That's like, 120 times $.1.

120 * .1 = 12

It costs $12 to fill the pool."
"So, there's this classroom with 30 boys. They got 3 times as many girls as boys, so that's 3 x 30 = 90 girls. Then, they got 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so that's 1/10 x 30 = 3 nongendered kids. Now, we add 'em all up: 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered kids = 123 total kids.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"So, we got a thing about electric poles and wires, right? They gotta be in a ratio, like 1 to 3. That means for every 1 pole, we need 3 wires. We're told there's 45 wires, so we gotta figure out how many poles we need.

We take the 45 wires and divide 'em by 3, 'cause that's the ratio. 45 ÷ 3 = 15. So, we need 15 poles."
"So, there's this party with 25 men and 15 women. Then, 1/4 of the people leave. That means 1/4 of 40 people leave, which is 10 people. 

Now, we know 22 men stayed, so 3 men left. That means 3 out of the 10 people who left were men. So, the other 7 people who left were women.

To find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of women who left from the original number of women. That's 15 - 7 = 8 women.

The final answer is 8."
"So, there's this magazine and it's half the price of a book. The book costs $4. That means the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, I gotta figure out how much the pen costs. It's $1 less than the magazine, so it's $2 - $1 = $1.

The answer is $1."
"So, there's this girl Jam, and she's got 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose ones. That's a total of 26 pencils. Then, her sister Meg has 46 pencils. We need to add those together to find the total number of pencils.

So, 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to figure out how many boxes they need. Each box can hold 24 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by 24.

72 ÷ 24 = 3

So, they need 3 boxes.

Final answer: 3"
"So, Shannon makes iced coffee by puttin' hot coffee in a big glass and addin' ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee colder, but it also makes it weaker. When she puts ice cubes in the coffee, it gets colder, and when she adds cream, it gets even weaker.

Let's see... the coffee gets colder by 65 degrees, and each ice cube makes it colder by 13 degrees. So, we gotta figure out how many ice cubes she used. We can do that by dividin' 65 by 13. That's 5 ice cubes.

Now, each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. Then, she adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes it even weaker.

So, the total amount of coffee that's weaker is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"So, there's this guy Ralph's record store. People can trade their old records for new ones. They trade 2 old records for 1 new one. 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. We need to figure out how many old records they brought in.

Let's think about it. If 5 people got 7 new records, that's like, 7 divided by 5. That's 1.4, but you can't trade a fraction of a record, so we'll just say each person got 1 new record. They traded 2 old records for each new one.

So, if each person got 1 new record, they must have traded 1 old record. Now, we gotta multiply the number of old records each person traded by the number of people. That's 1 old record per person times 5 people.

1 old record per person * 5 people = 5 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 5 old records."
"So, there's this company with 100 people. They got junior programmers and senior programmers. The senior ones get $400 more than the junior ones. The junior ones get $2000 a month. 

First, we gotta figure out how many junior programmers they got. We know they're 2/5 of the total people. So, we do 2/5 of 100, which is 40. That means they got 40 junior programmers.

Now, we know how many senior programmers they got, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers get $2000 a month, and the senior ones get $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.

So, the junior programmers get 40 * $2000 = $80,000 a month. The senior programmers get 60 * $2400 = $144,000 a month.

Adding those together, we get $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 a month.

The answer is: $224,000"
"So, there's this bus thingy, and some people get on it at the terminal. Then, at the first stop, 5 more people get on. Then, at the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. We know that 20 people are gonna get on the bus at the third stop. 

To figure out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we gotta do some math. We know 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, we add those two numbers together: 5 + 8 = 13. 

Now, we gotta subtract the 7 people who got off at the second stop. So, we do 13 - 7 = 6. 

So, 6 people got on the bus at the terminal.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he's got 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. Then, he gives 14 to his friends, so he's down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he's got 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Then, he eats 3 more that night, so he's got 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left. And then he eats 2 more in the morning, so he's got 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"So, the phone is 60% charged and it charges 1% every 3 minutes. We need to figure out how long it takes to get to 100%.

First, we gotta find out how much more charge it needs. That's 100% - 60% = 40%. Now, we gotta find out how many 3-minute chunks that is. We do that by dividing 40 by 1 (since it charges 1% every 3 minutes). That's 40. Then we multiply that by 3 to get the total minutes. That's 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

Now, we gotta convert that to hours. We do that by dividing by 60. That's 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

So, it'll take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"So, Erin had some lollipops, like, 7, and then her mom gave her more, like, 10. That's 7 + 10, which is 17. Then Erin gave some to Ella, like, 3. So we gotta subtract 3 from 17, which is 14. Erin has 14 lollipops now.

The answer is 14."
"So, the lady had a card that gave her $1 off for every $20 she spent. She spent $80, so she got 80 / 20 = 4 dollars off. But then she had a coupon that made it 2 times that, so she got 4 * 2 = 8 dollars off.

Now, we gotta subtract the rewards from the total she spent. That's 80 - 8 = 72.

So, she paid 72 dollars."
"So, there's this guy Nick, and he's thinkin' 'bout gettin' two jobs. One job pays him $15 an hour, and he works 2000 hours a year. The other job pays him $42,000 a year. But, there's some extra stuff to think about.

For the first job, he's gotta pay taxes. It's 20% of his total income. So, we gotta calculate that. His total income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000. Then, we gotta take 20% of that, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, he's left with $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

The second job pays him $42,000 a year, but he's gotta pay property tax, which is $6,000. So, he's left with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, he's gotta pay 10% tax on that, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So, he's left with $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

So, the second job is better, 'cause it gives him more money. The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"So, there's this thing about castles in Scotland. They got 220 of 'em. And 40% of 'em are all crumbled and stuff. That's like, 88 castles. Now, half of those are just sittin' there empty, doin' nothin'. So, we gotta divide 88 by 2. That's 44."
"So, there's this guy Robert who wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa. He got two offers from different places. One place wants him to pay $1,350 right now, and then 6 more payments of $350 each. The other place wants him to pay $1,100 right now, and then 9 more payments of $250 each.

To figure out which one is better, we gotta add up the payments. For the first place, that's $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450. For the second place, that's $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

So, the first place is $100 more expensive."
"So we got a bunch of guys with paintball guns. DJ got 8, Nick got 10, RJ got 1, and Richard got 5. We need to add 'em up to see how many guns they got in total.

DJ's guns: 8
Nick's guns: 10
RJ's guns: 1
Richard's guns: 5

Let's add 'em up: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now we gotta divide that by how many guys there are. There's 4 guys. So we do 24 ÷ 4.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So each guy would get 6 guns if they shared 'em."
"So, Mason needs sugar for suckers and fudge. He needs 30 ounces for suckers and 70 ounces for fudge. He wants to make 8 suckers and 1 fudge. 

To find out how much sugar he needs, we gotta add the sugar for suckers and fudge. 

8 suckers * 30 ounces = 240 ounces
1 fudge * 70 ounces = 70 ounces

240 + 70 = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar."
"So, Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. Then, the price goes up by 50% in the first year, and then it goes down by 25% in the second year. I'm gonna calculate this for ya.

First, I'm gonna find out how much the price goes up. 50% of $8 is $4, so the price goes up to $8 + $4 = $12. Now, the price is $12.

Next, I'm gonna find out how much the price goes down. 25% of $12 is $3, so the price goes down to $12 - $3 = $9.

Maria bought 8 shares, so I'm gonna multiply $9 by 8 to find the total value. $9 * 8 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"So, there's this Luke guy, and he ate 2 hot dogs. Then there's Thomas, and he ate way more than Luke. Like, three times more. So, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, there's John, and he ate half of what Thomas ate. Half of 6 is 3, so John ate 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we gotta subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate. That's 3 - 2 = 1.

The answer is 1."
"So, we got a class of 200 students, and they're divided into three groups. Two of 'em are the same size, and the last one is smaller. It's 10 less than the other two. We need to figure out how many students are in the smallest group.

Let's say the smallest group has x students. Then the other two groups have x + 10 students each. We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide by 3:

x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

60"
"So, there's this fella, Farmer Brown, and he's got a whole bunch of animals on his farm. He's got chickens and cows, and he's got twice as many chickens as cows. That's right, twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up an equation: x + 2x = 60. 

Simplifying that, we get 3x = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 20. So, there's 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. We can find the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and then adding them together. 

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
80 + 80 = 160 legs

So, the total number of legs is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"So, Josh is practicin' juggling, and he starts with 3 balls. He adds 1 ball each week. That's like, 3, 4, 5, 6 balls. He's got 6 balls at the end of the fourth week. Then, he drops 3 balls, but 2 of 'em get caught, so he loses 1 ball. That means he's left with 6 - 1 = 5 balls."
"So, we got a pink frog, a blue beetle, a green toad, a yellow snake, and a red bird. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, which is 50 pounds. The green toad also weighs 50 pounds. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog, so it's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog, so it's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we gotta add up all the weights. We got the pink frog (50), the blue beetle (50), the green toad (50), the yellow snake (60), and the container (20). And we gotta subtract the red bird (30) 'cause it's not in the container.

So, let's do the math: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20 = 190. Then, we subtract 30: 190 - 30 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"So, Laurel got some baby clothes from her friend. Her friend gave her 24 of 'em. Then, she got some more at a baby shower. She got twice as many as her friend gave her, so that's 2 x 24 = 48. And then her mom gave her 15 more. So, we gotta add 'em all up.

24 + 48 = 72
72 + 15 = 87

So, Laurel has 87 baby clothes now."
"So, there's this fella Tyson, and he's a runner. He runs 5000 meters every day. His coach tells him to run more, like, a lot more. The coach says he should run 1/5 more meters, and I think that's like, 1000 meters. So, now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

There's 30 days in June, and if he runs 6000 meters every day, then he runs 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters in June.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"So, there's this thing about juice boxes. One of 'em is 4 bucks. Another one is 5 bucks more than the first one. That means it's 4 + 5 = 9 bucks. The third one is 7 bucks more than the first one, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 bucks.

Now, we gotta figure out how much more the third one is than the second one. We take the price of the third one, 11, and subtract the price of the second one, 9. That's 11 - 9 = 2.

So, the third juice box is 2 bucks more than the second one.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2."
"So, we got two kinds of tables, right? One with 4 legs and one with 3 legs. I'm gonna count 'em.

For the tables with 4 legs, I count 40 of 'em. That's 40 * 4 = 160 legs. That's a lotta legs!

And then there's the tables with 3 legs. I count 50 of 'em. That's 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, I add 'em together: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

So, the answer is 310 legs."
"So, Jenny buys a bag of cookies that's got 36 cookies in it. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box every day for 5 days. That's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many cookies are left for Jenny. We take the total number of cookies that got eaten (20 + 7 = 27) and subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag (36). That's 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. 

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"So, Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall. They cost $30 each, but he got a discount. The discount is 40%. I think I know how to figure this out. 

First, I gotta find 40% of $30. That's like, 40/100 * 30. I think that's 12. So, the discount is $12. Now, I subtract that from the price of the shirt, which is $30. That's $30 - $12 = $18. 

Now, Davos bought 2 shirts, so I gotta multiply $18 by 2. That's $18 * 2 = $36. 

The final answer is: $36"
"So, they used to make tractors and sell 'em for $100 each. Now, they make silos and sell 'em for $220 each. They sell 10 tractors a day and now they sell 5 silos a day.

Let's see how much they make from tractors and silos. They make 10 tractors a day, and each tractor costs $100, so they make 10 * $100 = $1000 from tractors.

Now, they make 5 silos a day, and each silo costs $220, so they make 5 * $220 = $1100 from silos.

So, they make $1000 + $1100 = $2100 in total.

Now, let's see how much more they make now compared to before. They used to make $1000, and now they make $2100, so they make $2100 - $1000 = $1100 more.

To find the percentage, we need to divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100. That's ($1100 / $1000) * 100 = 110%.

So, they make 110% more now.

Final answer: 110"
"So, there's this lady named Madeline, and she buys stuff for her dog every month. The dog's food costs $25 a week, and there's 4 weeks in a month. That means the dog's food costs $25 * 4 = $100 a month.

She also buys treats for her dog, and that costs $20 a month. And then there's the medicine, which costs $100 a month.

So, let's add all that up: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 a month.

Now, we need to figure out how much she spends on her dog in a year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply $220 by 12. That's $220 * 12 = $2640 a year.

The final answer is: $2640"
"So, Peyton's got a bunch of stuff to do after work. 

She does a yoga class on Monday, that's 1 hour. Then she does a cooking class on Tuesday, and that's 3 times as long as the yoga class, so that's 3 hours. On Wednesday, she's doin' a cheese-tasting thingy, and that's half an hour. Thursday, she's doin' a museum tour, and that's half as long as the cookin' class, so that's 1.5 hours. And finally, she's doin' some errands on Friday, that's 2 hours.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The answer is: 7.5"
"So, April needs a lot of plant pots for the school garden. She wants 30 for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. That means she needs 2 x 30 = 60 pots for the roses. 

So, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 pots in total. But she already had 100 pots. To find out how many she has left, we need to subtract the number of pots she needs from the number she already had. That's 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"So, there's this lady named Andrea. She had some money, and then she bought a sweater for $11 and gave her brother $4. We need to figure out how much money she had before she did all that.

Let's say she had x dollars. She spent $11 on the sweater and gave her brother $4, so she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15. 

Now, we need to find out how much money she had before she spent that $15. We can do that by subtracting $15 from the amount she had initially. 

x - $15 = $36

To find x, we can add $15 to both sides of the equation:

x = $36 + $15
x = $51

So, Andrea had $51 before she bought the sweater and gave her brother some money.

The final answer is $51."
"So, John did some stuff on vacation. He spent 6 hours doin' boatin', and half that time swimmin', which is 3 hours. Then he watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours total. He did all that stuff in 30% of his time. 

Let's figure out how much time he had in total. If 30% of it was 15 hours, then the whole thing is 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours. 

Now, he spent 40% of his time sightseein', so we gotta find 40% of 50. That's 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The answer is 20."
"So Annabelle is savin' for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her piggy bank. She works at two jobs. At one job, she makes $10 an hour and she works for 20 hours. That's $200. At the other job, she makes $5 an hour and she works for 15 hours. That's $75. So, she makes a total of $200 + $75 = $275. Now, let's add that to the $80 she already has: $275 + $80 = $355. To find out how much more she needs, we gotta subtract $355 from $400. That's $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"So, there's this thing about three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest one is 6 feet tall. The other one is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we gotta figure out how tall the biggest tree is. We add the heights of the two shorter trees together, which is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. Then, we multiply that by 2, 'cause the biggest tree is twice as tall as the other two. That's 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"So, Dean's mom gave him some money to go to the toy store. He bought a bunch of toy cars and teddy bears. The toy cars cost 2 dollars each and the teddy bears cost 1 dollar each. He bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears.

First, let's find out how much he spent on the toy cars. 6 toy cars times 2 dollars each is 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. Then, he bought 5 teddy bears for 1 dollar each, so that's 5 x 1 = 5 dollars. The total he spent is 12 + 5 = 17 dollars.

He started with 28 dollars. After buying all that stuff, he had 28 - 17 = 11 dollars. Then, his mom gave him some more money, 10 dollars. So, now he has 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.

The final answer is: $21"
"So, there's this girl named Morgan, and she's got a birthday party. She's got a budget of $90. She wants to do some stuff with her friends. 

She wants to play mini-golf, and that costs $5. She also wants to ride them go-karts twice, and that's $10 a ride, so that's $20. And she wants some arcade tokens, but I don't know how much those cost, but let's just say it's $5 for now.

So, the total cost of all that stuff is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30. Now, we gotta subtract that from her budget, which is $90. So, $90 - $30 = $60.

Now, we gotta figure out how many friends she can invite. Each friend costs $5, so we gotta divide $60 by $5. That's $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is 12."
"So, Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops that cost 25 cents each. We need to figure out how much money she saves.

First, we need to know how much she spends on lollipops. There are 4 lollipops and each one costs 25 cents. So, we multiply 4 by 25 cents. That's 4 x 25 = 100 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can say 100 cents is $1. So, she spends $1 on lollipops.

Now, we need to find out how much she saves. She gets $5 every day and spends $1 on lollipops. To find out how much she saves, we subtract $1 from $5. That's $5 - $1 = $4.

So, Marisa saves $4 in her piggy bank.

Final answer: $4"
"So, Billy got $10 from his dad. He spent some of that on candy, and then he bought gumballs with the rest. The gumballs cost 5 cents each, and he bought 40 of 'em. That's 40 * 5 cents, which is $2. He spent all of his change on gumballs, so he musta had $2 left. That means he had $10 - $2 = $8 to start with.

Now, he spent $1.50 on candy. So, he had $8 - $1.50 = $6.50 left. Candy costs $1.50 a pound, so we gotta divide $6.50 by $1.50 to see how many pounds of candy he bought. That's $6.50 ÷ $1.50 = 4.33 pounds.

The answer is 4.33 pounds."
"So, there's this guy Carver, and he's 45 years old. His son is like, 5 years less than twice his age. We need to figure out how old the son is.

Let's say the son's age is S. We know Carver's age is 45, so we can set up an equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

Now, let's add 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S
This gives us 50 = 2S.

Next, we need to get S by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2: 50 ÷ 2 = S
This gives us S = 25.

So, the son is 25 years old.

The final answer is 25."
"So, there's this train that goes between three cities. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. That's 75 + 100 + (100 - 50) = 225 miles for one trip.

It does this trip three times a day, so it travels 225 * 3 = 675 miles in a day. The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can just leave it as 0.0375 days.

The final answer is 0.0375."
"So, there's this fella Mark, and he makes dog beds. He needs different amounts of stuffing for different kinds of dogs. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. Now, a collie bed takes the average of the two, which is like, 5 pounds.

So, if Mark makes 4 chihuahua beds, he'll need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. And for 3 collie beds, he'll need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds. 

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we just add those two numbers together: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"So, John's friend lives 200 miles away, and he drives to get there. He's goin' 70 miles per hour. That's a pretty good speed. He's gonna take a detour, which is 10 miles. That's like, a little extra. Then he's gonna drive back home, and that's 240 miles. He's gonna go 80 miles per hour on the way back.

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to get to his friend's house. We gotta divide the distance by the speed. So, 200 miles divided by 70 miles per hour is... um... 2.86 hours. That's a long time, but he's a good driver.

Now, he's gotta take the detour. That's 10 miles, and he's still goin' 70 miles per hour. So, 10 miles divided by 70 miles per hour is... 0.14 hours. That's like, a short little break.

Then he's gotta drive back home. That's 240 miles, and he's goin' 80 miles per hour. So, 240 miles divided by 80 miles per hour is... 3 hours. That's a long time, but he's a good driver.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours is... 5.99 hours. That's a long trip.

The final answer is: 5.99"
"So, there's 96 kids in the 4th grade at Small Tree School. 43 of 'em are girls. On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys didn't show up. To find out how many boys were there, we gotta subtract the number of absent kids from the total number of kids.

Let's do the math: 96 (total kids) - 9 (absent kids) = 87

So, there were 87 boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"So, there's this park with 6 girls in it. And it's said that there's twice as many boys as girls. That means if you take the number of girls and divide it by 2, you get the number of boys. 

So, 6 divided by 2 is 3. That's the number of boys. Now, to find the total number of kids, you just add the number of boys and girls together. 

6 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 9

The answer is 9."
"So, Jane gotta take 3 tests and she needs 42 points. She already got 15 and 18 points on the first two tests. Let's see how many points she needs on the third test.

She got 15 + 18 = 33 points so far. She needs 42 points in total. So, she needs 42 - 33 = 9 points on the third test.

The answer is 9."
"So, there's this Walmart place and they got rid of 3 people 'cause they didn't wanna wear masks. Then, they got rid of 7 more 'cause they stole stuff. And then they got rid of 21 more 'cause they got all physical with the stuff on sale. 

Now, I gotta figure out how many got kicked out for other reasons. I'm thinkin' it's like, 50 in total, and I gotta subtract the ones I already know about. So, I subtract 3, 7, and 21 from 50.

50 - 3 = 47
47 - 7 = 40
40 - 21 = 19

So, 19 people got kicked out for other reasons."
"So, there's this girl Erin and she scored 14 points. And she has three times more points than this other girl Sara, who scored 8 points. We need to figure out how many points Erin had before she scored 14.

Let's think about it... If Sara had some points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, that means Erin's points are Sara's points times three. So, if Sara had x points, Erin had 3x points.

We know Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up an equation: 3x = 14. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3. That's like sharing 14 cookies among 3 people, so each person gets 14 / 3 cookies. That's 4.67 cookies. But we can't have a fraction of a cookie, so we'll round down to 4 or 5. Since Sara can't have a fraction of a point, we'll say Sara had 5 points.

Now, if Sara had 5 points, Erin had 3 times that, which is 3 * 5 = 15. But we know Erin scored 14 points, so she must have had 15 - 14 = 1 point before.

The answer is 1."
"So, we gotta figure out how much it's gonna cost to give out all these senior awards. 

First, we gotta get the picture frames. There's 44 seniors, and each frame costs $20. That's 44 * $20 = $880. Now, we gotta add some extra money for the logo on each frame. That's 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost for the frames is $880 + $4 = $884.

Next, we gotta get some pins for 2 of the seniors. That's 2 * $5 = $10.

Then, we gotta get some cords for the officers. There's 11 officers, and each cord costs $12. That's 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $884 (frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"So, there's this hand-painted wallpaper that costs $400. If you make it yourself, you save 20% of that price. I think that's like, 20% of 400, right? That's 0.20 * 400 = 80 bucks. So, you subtract that from the original price.

$400 - $80 = $320

So, the DIY hand-painted wallpaper costs $320."
"So, there's this shoe store and they had a sale. They sold a lot of shoes. 

First, they sold 14 pairs on Friday. Then, they sold twice that amount on Saturday, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs. 

On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. But, some people didn't like the shoes and brought 'em back, so we gotta subtract those. They brought back 6 pairs.

So, we add up all the pairs sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs. Then we subtract the ones that were brought back: 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

The answer is 50."
"So, Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. 

Let's see... if Tuesday's class is 1 hour, then Saturday's class is 2 hours. So, we got 1 hour for Tuesday, 2 hours for Thursday, and 2 hours for Saturday. 

Now, let's add 'em up: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. 

The final answer is 5."
"So, the company bought $400,000 worth of equipment, but 40% of it was bad. That means 40% of 400,000 is bad, and the rest is good. 

To find out how much money they spent on good equipment, we gotta find out how many good pieces there are. If 40% is bad, that means 60% is good. So, we gotta find 60% of 400,000.

60% of 400,000 is 0.6 * 400,000 = 240,000. That's the amount of money they spent on good equipment.

The answer is: $240,000"
"So, Mary has 30 sheep. She gets milk from half of them and the other half gets milk too. Half of 30 is 15, so she gets milk from 15 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from those 15, and 2 kg from the other 15. 

So, she gets 15 * 1 = 15 kg from the first 15, and 15 * 2 = 30 kg from the other 15. 

Now, let's add those together: 15 + 30 = 45 kg. That's how much milk Mary gets every day."
"So, Mrs. Sherman had a bunch of bread rolls, like, a dozen or somethin'. She gave some to her kids, and then she cut up the rest. I think she had 6 rolls left, right? Then she cut those up into little pieces, and I'm pretty sure she cut 'em into 8 pieces each. So, if she had 6 rolls, and she cut 'em up into 8 pieces each, that's like... 6 x 8 = 48 pieces. I think that's how many pieces of bread she gave to the chickens."
"So, there's this big class with 40 kids. Half of 'em like blue, which is 40 divided by 2, that's 20. Now, we gotta find out how many like the other colors. We take the rest, which is 40 minus 20, that's 20. Then, one-fourth of those 20 like green, which is 20 divided by 4, that's 5. The rest, which is 20 minus 5, is the number of kids who like yellow. So, 20 minus 5 is 15."
"So, Lucy sells apples from her orchard. She sells 'em for $4 each. On Monday, she sold all the apples she picked. That means she sold 56 apples, 'cause 56 divided by 4 is 14. That's how many apples she picked on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Then, on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is 2 times 12, so that's 24 apples.

Now, let's add 'em up: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Lindsay is doin' laundry and thinks she's missin' some socks. There's 50 socks in total. She washed 10 pairs, and that's 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Then she washed 15 loose socks. So, she's washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

To find out how many socks she's missin', we gotta subtract the ones she washed from the total. That's 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The answer is 15."
"So, Rachel had some cookies, and then her brother ate some. I think she had 23 cookies to start with. Then, her friend Janet gave her some more cookies. I'm not really sure how many Janet gave her, but let's say it was 42. So now Rachel has 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

But then, her brother ate a lot of cookies. I think he ate 44 cookies. So, we need to subtract 44 from 65. That's 65 - 44 = 21.

I think Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"So, Karan borrowed some money, like $3,650, and she's gotta pay it back in 5 months. The interest rate is 10%. We need to figure out how much she's gotta pay each month.

To do that, we gotta find out the interest first. Interest is like, 10% of the money she borrowed. So, we multiply $3,650 by 0.10 (that's 10% as a decimal). That's $365. Then we add that to the money she borrowed, which is $3,650. So, $3,650 + $365 = $4,015.

Now, we gotta divide that by 5, 'cause she's payin' it back in 5 months. $4,015 ÷ 5 = $802.

So, Karan's gotta pay $802 each month.

The final answer is $802."
"So, there's this guy Cho, he hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. That's a pretty long time. Then there's this other girl Chloe, she hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. We need to figure out how much farther Cho hiked than Chloe.

To do that, we gotta multiply the speed by the time. For Cho, that's 14 kilometers per hour times 8 hours. That's 112 kilometers. 

For Chloe, we do the same thing, 9 kilometers per hour times 5 hours, and that's 45 kilometers.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two. That's 112 minus 45, which is 67 kilometers.

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is 67."
"So, Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 120 gold pesos.

Let's count the silver and gold they have together. Axel has 50 + 80 = 130. Anna has 100 + 120 = 220. Together they have 130 + 220 = 350.

The answer is 350."
"So, there's this girl Millie, and she's got a lemonade stand. She spent 18 bucks to get all the stuff she needs to make lemonade. Each pitcher can hold 12 cups, and she's got 3 pitchers, so she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for a buck, so she makes 36 x 1 = 36 bucks.

She spent 18 bucks, so she's got 36 - 18 = 18 bucks left over. That's her profit. Now, she sells lemonade for 4 cups every hour, and she's got 36 cups to sell. So, she's gonna sell it for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

So, her profit is 18 bucks, and she's gonna sell it for 9 hours. That's 18 / 9 = 2 bucks per hour."
"So, Mr. Ruther sold some land and had 12.8 hectares left. He sold 3/5 of it. That means he has 2/5 left. We need to figure out how much land he had at first.

Let's say he had x hectares. We know that 2/5 of x is 12.8. To find x, we can multiply 12.8 by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The answer is: 32"
"So, there's this choir with 52 members. Half of 'em are boys and half are girls. That means there's 26 girls. They wanna perform, but half the people can't make it. That's 14 people. Then, 3 teachers come and sing with 'em. So, we gotta add those 3 teachers to the 26 girls. That's 26 + 3 = 29 people. Half of 29 is 14.5, but we can't have half a person, so we just take 14 people who can't make it. That means 29 - 14 = 15 people can perform.

The final answer is 15."
"So, there's this fella named Wilson, and he needs a good grade on his report card to get the car for the weekend. He's got 5 test scores, and I'm gonna add 'em up for him.

65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, I'm gonna divide that by 5, 'cause that's how many tests he took.

400 ÷ 5 = 80

So, Wilson's math grade is 80."
"So, we gotta figure out how much 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost. 

First, we gotta multiply the number of erasers by the price of one eraser. That's 6 * 2, which is... 12 dollars. Then, we do the same thing with the pencils. 8 * 3 is... 24 dollars. Now, we add those two numbers together. 12 + 24 is... 36 dollars.

The answer is: $36"
"So, James is in charge of deliverin' messages to the teachers. He gives 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Then he gives 1/3 of that to Mr. Yu. That's like, 66 divided by 3, which is 22. So, he gives 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages, we just add 'em together: 66 + 22 = 88.

The final answer is: 88"
"So, David and Dasha went to the carnival. There's 9 rides and each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket is 2 dollars. You can also buy a special thing for 30 dollars that lets you ride all 9 rides.

If David buys that special thing, he don't need to buy any tickets. But if Dasha buys tickets, she needs 9 tickets. 9 tickets would cost 9 * 2 = 18 dollars.

The special thing costs 30 dollars. So, Dasha spends 18 dollars on tickets and David spends 30 dollars on the special thing. David spends more money than Dasha.

To find out how much David saves, we need to subtract the amount Dasha spent from the amount David spent. That's 30 - 18 = 12 dollars.

The answer is 12."
"So, Monica's got a lot of gifts to wrap. She's got 6 for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That's a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts. She's got 144 inches of ribbon. 

To figure out how much ribbon she can use for each gift, we gotta divide the ribbon by the number of gifts. So, we do 144 ÷ 12. That's 12. 

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift."
"So, there's this thing about popsicles, right? People got 5 and 6 of 'em, and they add up to 11. We gotta figure out how many each person got. 

We take the total number of popsicles, which is 165, and we divide it by 11. That's like, 165 ÷ 11. 

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now, we know that 5 and 6 are the parts, so we multiply 15 by 5 and 6. That's like, 15 * 5 and 15 * 6.

15 * 5 = 75
15 * 6 = 90

So, Betty got 75 popsicles and Sam got 90 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam got than Betty, we subtract 75 from 90.

90 - 75 = 15

The answer is 15."
"So, Tim is tryin' to save some cash by cancelin' his cable subscription. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each, but he gets a discount 'cause he's bundlin' 'em. That's like, 20% off, right?

So, 20% of $10 is $2, so he's savin' $2 on each of them. That's $4 total. Now, he's payin' $10 for Netflix and $4 for Hulu and Disney Plus, which is $14 total.

He used to pay $60 for the cable package. Now he's payin' $14 for the streamin' services. To find out how much he's savin', we gotta subtract the new price from the old price.

$60 (cable package) - $14 (streamin' services) = $46

So, Tim's savin' $46 a month by cancelin' his cable package.

The final answer is $46."
"So, Carol spends 4 hours writin' a song, half that much time recordin' it, and 90 minutes editin' it. We gotta convert the 90 minutes to hours, 'cause there's 60 minutes in an hour. So, 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time she spent:
- Writin' time: 4 hours
- Record time: 1.5 hours
- Edit time: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find out what percentage of time she spent editin', we gotta divide the edit time by the total time and multiply by 100. That's like, 1.5 divided by 7, then multiplied by 100. That's 21.43%.

So, she spent 21.43% of her time editin' the song."
"So, there's this thing about a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. It's like a big grid, ya know? And Wendy wants to put 20 more books than double the number of books in it. 

First, we gotta find out how many books the whole thing can hold. We do that by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns. So, 6 rows times 6 columns is 36 books. That's the whole thing's capacity.

Now, Wendy wants to put double that number of books in it, plus 20 more. So, we gotta double 36, which is 72. Then we add 20 to that, which makes 92.

So, Wendy needs 92 books."
"So, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, and each box had 15 cards. That's 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's add the cards she made and got from her dad: 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family. So, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

So, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards.

The answer is: 21"
"So, there's this lady Jenny, and she's got a pizza with 12 slices. She gives some to Bill and some to Mark. Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, and Mark gets 1/4 of it. I think 1/3 is 4 slices, and 1/4 is 3 slices. So, she gives away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Now, Jenny's left with 12 - 7 = 5 slices. But then she eats 2 of 'em. So, she's got 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"So, Mark has some money in his bank account, like $50. He gets $10 every day from his job. He wants a bike that costs $300. We need to figure out how many days he needs to save for that bike.

Let's think about it... If he gets $10 a day, and the bike costs $300, we gotta divide $300 by $10 to see how many days it'll take him. That's like, 30 days. He needs 30 days to save enough money for the bike.

The answer is 30."
"So, there's this lady Nancy, and she's cleanin' out her woodshed. She found 90 spiders. Then she found some millipedes, which is 1/3 of the number of spiders. That's 1/3 * 90 = 30 millipedes.

Now, she found some stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, that's 2 * 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

To find the total number of bugs, we add 'em all together: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168 bugs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"So, there's this lady named Erica, and she's 30 years old. Her sister, Beth, is 5 years older than her, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Now, there's another lady named Alice, and she's 7 years older than Beth. So, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

To find the difference between their ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The answer is 12."
"So, we got a glass of milk that's 8 ounces, and John drank 2 glasses. We need to figure out how many calories he got from that. 

First, we gotta multiply the number of glasses by the ounces per glass. That's 2 glasses times 8 ounces, which is 16 ounces. 

Now, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. So, we multiply 16 ounces by 3 calories. That's 16 times 3, which is 48 calories.

So, John had 48 calories from the milk."
"So, this guy works for 4 weeks a month, and that's 4 * 4 = 16 weeks a year. He works 6 days a week, so that's 16 * 6 = 96 days a year. He gets paid $50 a day, so he makes 96 * 50 = $4800 a year.

Final answer: $4800"
"So, Mark is makin' a big ol' batch of brownies. He needs 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Flour comes in 2-cup bags and milk comes in 2-cup bottles. 

First, we gotta figure out how much flour and milk Mark needs. He's makin' 4 batches, so we multiply the normal amounts by 4. 

For flour, that's 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Now, we divide that by 2, 'cause flour comes in 2-cup bags. 12 / 2 = 6 bags. 

For milk, it's 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. We divide that by 2, 'cause milk comes in 2-cup bottles. 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

Now, we gotta find out how many more bags of flour Mark needs than bottles of milk. We take the number of bags and subtract the number of bottles. That's 6 - 2 = 4.

The answer is 4."
"So, Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. That means he uses 900 watts of energy each hour. If he cuts back on using the AC by 5 hours a day, how much energy will he save in 30 days?

To figure this out, we need to first find out how much energy he uses in 30 days at the original rate. He uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, so that's 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours. Multiply that by 30 days and you get 7200 * 30 = 216,000 watt-hours.

Now, if he cuts back to 3 hours a day, he uses 900 watts for 3 hours, which is 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours. Multiply that by 30 days and you get 2700 * 30 = 81,000 watt-hours.

The difference between the two is 216,000 - 81,000 = 135,000 watt-hours. To make it easier to understand, we can convert that to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000. So, 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of energy in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"So, there's this lady Jane, and she's countin' zebras. She's got two of 'em with 17 stripes each, and then there's one zebra with 36 stripes. And then there's another one with half the stripes of the one with 36. I think that's 36 divided by 2, which is 18.

So, let's add up all the stripes. The two with 17 stripes each is 2 x 17, which is 34. Then we got 36, and 18. Now, let's add 'em all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

There's 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we gotta divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. That's 88 divided by 4, which is 22.

The answer is 22."
"So, Tyson wanna make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, huh? He needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese for each sandwich, and each sandwich serves 4 people. There's 20 people watchin' the game, so he needs:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will be 5 * $7.00 = $35.00
The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will be 5 * $3.00 = $15.00

So, Tyson's gonna spend $35.00 on meat and $15.00 on cheese, which is a total of $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

$50.00"
"So, there's this guy Allan, and he's got a lot of cannolis. He's got 40 of 'em. Then he goes to the store and buys 60 more cannolis. Now he's got 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Now, he's got twice as many corns as cannolis. So, he's got 2 * 100 = 200 corns.

So, if we add the number of corns and cannolis together, we get 200 + 100 = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"So, Elliott is tryin' to walk 10,000 steps a day. He did half of that on his way to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 steps with his friend. That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After that, he went for a short jog and had 2,000 steps left to do. To figure out how many steps he did on his jog, we gotta subtract the steps he had left from the steps he did before the jog. So, 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The answer is 4,000."
"So, there's this guy Toby, and he's readin' a book. The book's got 45 pages, and each page's got 200 words on it. That's a lotta words, man. Anyway, Toby can read 300 words per minute. He's gotta get to the airport in 60 minutes, and he's gonna leave as soon as he finishes the book. He's also got 10 minutes to get to the airport.

First, we gotta figure out how long it'll take Toby to finish the book. We do that by dividin' the total number of words by his readin' rate. So, 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words. Then we divide that by 300 words per minute, which is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes. That's how long it'll take him to finish the book.

Now, we gotta figure out how early he'll be at the airport. He's gotta be there in 60 minutes, and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book. So, we subtract 30 from 60, which is 60 - 30 = 30 minutes. That means he'll be 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"So, there's this delivery service company, right? They hired 40 people in May. Each of 'em gets paid $15 an hour and works 40 hours a week. That's a lotta cash, if you ask me.

So, let's do the math. 40 people, $15 an hour, 40 hours a week. That's 40 * 15 * 40 = $24,000. That's how much they paid in May.

Now, in June, some people's contracts ran out. I think it was 1/4 of 'em. That's 40 * 1/4 = 10 people. So, they had 40 - 10 = 30 people left. They paid 'em $15 an hour, 40 hours a week, so that's 30 * 15 * 40 = $18,000.

So, the total amount they paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

$42,000"
"So Sally went to the seashore for vacation. Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She scooped up 2 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.

First, let's figure out how much the taffy cost. The first pound is $3. The second pound is half off, so it's $3 - $1.50 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the other stuff. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

$3"
"So, Tim buys some fireworks. He gets two packs, one costs $400 and the other costs twice that, so it's $800. Then he buys a finale firework for $150. 

First, we gotta add the two packs together: $400 + $800 = $1200. Then, he gets a discount on those two packs. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. So, the two packs cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the finale firework to that: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"So, Shannon wants to make cookies for 30 days. She eats 2 cookies a night. That's 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

We need to figure out how many dozen cookies that is. A dozen is 12 cookies. So, we gotta divide 60 by 12. That's 60 ÷ 12 = 5. 

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies."
"So, there's this lady, Marcy, and she makes candles. She says they're 99% safe, but 5% of 'em got a bad smell like wet dog. She makes 50,000 candles. We need to figure out how many of 'em are both bad and smell like wet dog.

We know 5% of the candles are bad, but we don't know if that's the same as the ones that smell bad. Let's just say it is, 'cause that's what the problem says. So, we gotta find 5% of 50,000.

To do that, we multiply 50,000 by 0.05. That's like having 50,000 groups of 5, and that's 2500.

So, 2500 candles will smell like wet dog and probably explode.

2500"
"So, Misha buys 4 blouses from the sale rack. The regular price of each blouse is $20. The blouses are 30% off. To find out how much Misha paid, I gotta calculate the discount first.

The discount is 30% of $20. That's 0.30 times $20. So, the discount is $6. Now, I subtract that from the regular price. $20 minus $6 is $14. That's the price Misha paid for each blouse.

Since Misha bought 4 blouses, I multiply $14 by 4. That's $56. So, Misha paid a total of $56 for the blouses.

The final answer is: $56"
"So, there's this girl Joanne, and she's pickin' apples from her family's orchard. Her sister comes out to help her. Joanne picks 30 apples from the tallest trees, and half that amount from the shortest trees. She picks more apples from the middle trees. Her sister picks twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees. She don't pick any from the middle trees.

The sisters picked a total of 500 apples. We need to figure out how many apples Joanne picked from the middle trees.

Let's say Joanne picked x apples from the middle trees. Then, her sister picked 2x apples from the tallest trees and 3x apples from the shortest trees.

We know Joanne picked 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount from the shortest trees, so she picked 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister picked 60 apples from the tallest trees and 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of apples picked by both sisters:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 90 + 0 = 500

Combine like terms:

195 + x = 500

Subtract 195 from both sides:

x = 305

So, Joanne picked 305 apples from the middle trees.

The final answer is: 305"
"So, we got a problem here. We got a bunch of camels and dromedaries, and we need to figure out how many dromedaries there are. We know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. We also know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps.

Let's think about it... If we got 180 heads, that means we got 180 camels and dromedaries. But we also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. So, if we add up all the bumps, we should get 304. That means we got 2 times the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries, which is equal to 304.

Let's write an equation: 2c + d = 304, where c is the number of camels and d is the number of dromedaries. We also know that c + d = 180.

Now, let's solve for c. If we subtract the second equation from the first equation, we get: 2c + d - (c + d) = 304 - 180. This simplifies to c = 124.

Now that we know c, we can plug it back into one of the equations to find d. If we use c + d = 180, we get 124 + d = 180. Solving for d, we get d = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"So, Tom went on a trip to Europe. He walked a lot in the first 4 days. He walked 200 kilometers every day, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers. Then, he walked some more, but not as much as the first 4 days. He walked 30% of the first 4 days, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the first 6 days he walked 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers. He didn't walk on the 7th day. Then, he walked 300 kilometers every day for the next 7 days. That's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers. So, the total distance he walked is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is 3140."
"So, there's this guy Zack and his locker. It's half the size of this other guy Timothy's locker. And then there's Peter, and his locker is a quarter the size of Zack's locker. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 

So, if Peter's locker is a quarter of Zack's, we gotta multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size. That's 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches. 

Now, since Timothy's locker is half the size of Zack's, we gotta multiply Zack's locker size by 2. That's 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The answer is 40."
"So, Stanley was standin' on a mountain, 10,000 feet up, and a big gust of wind took his comb and it fell 4,000 feet down to a ledge. His brother Oliver was on the mountain too, but he was 3,000 feet down. Stanley called Oliver on his phone and asked him to find his comb. 

To find out how high Oliver needs to climb, we gotta add the two numbers together. 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000. That's how high Stanley's comb is. Now, we need to find out how much higher Oliver is from the comb. He's 3,000 feet lower, so we subtract that from the comb's height. 14,000 - 3,000 = 11,000. That's how high Oliver needs to climb.

The answer is 11,000."
"So, Mr. Josue got some money from two banks. He had some money already. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. That means the second bank gave him 2 x $4000 = $8000.

Now, we need to add the money he already had to the money he got from the banks. He had $5000. The first bank gave him $4000 and the second bank gave him $8000. So, we add $5000 + $4000 + $8000.

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue has $17000 now.

The final answer is: $17000"
"So, there's this rock with 50 cats on it. Then, 4 boats come and take 5 cats each. That's 4 * 5 = 20 cats gone. Now, we got 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.

Then, some cats see a mouse and run after it. They take 3/5 of the 30 cats. To find 3/5 of 30, I counted on my fingers and got 18 cats gone. Now, we got 30 - 18 = 12 cats left.

So, there's 12 cats on the rock now."
"So, there's this guy Bill, and he's gettin' a new streaming service. He gets a deal where the first 6 months is $8 a month, then it goes up to $12 a month after that. Then, after 8 months, it goes up again to $14 a month. We gotta figure out how much it costs him for 2 whole years.

Let's break it down. For the first 6 months, it's $8 a month, so that's 6 x $8 = $48. Then, for the next 8 months, it's $12 a month, so that's 8 x $12 = $96. And for the last 8 months, it's $14 a month, so that's 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's add 'em all up: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256. So, Bill's gonna pay $256 for 2 whole years of the service."
"So, Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. He had two kinds of jeans: tattered and jogger. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered ones. Cole bought both and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the money from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's say the price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Cole saved 1/3 of the money from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * x. He saved 2/3 of the money from the tattered jeans, which is 2/3 * (x + 6). The total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the price of the tattered jeans:

Price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"So, there's this thing about buses and stuff. We got 4 buses, and each one can hold 60 people. That's 4 x 60 = 240 people. Then, we got 6 little buses, and each one can hold 30 people. That's 6 x 30 = 180 people. And, we got 10 little vans, and each one can hold 15 people. That's 10 x 15 = 150 people.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people. So, 570 people can go on the trip."
"So, Lillian's got a garden and she wants to put up some bird feeders. She makes 3 and buys 3 more. The store-bought ones get 20 birds a day, and the ones she made get 30 birds a day. 

We gotta figure out how many birds she'll see in total. So, we gotta add the birds from the store-bought ones and the homemade ones. 

Store-bought ones: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
Homemade ones: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

Now, we add 'em together: 60 + 90 = 150 birds

The answer is: 150"
"So, Aleksandra went to a restaurant and she ordered some stuff. She got a bagel, soup, and cake. The bagel costs $4. The soup is more expensive than the bagel, and it's 25% more. That means the soup costs $4 + $1, which is $5. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it's $4 / 2, which is $2.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"So, Kenny's tryin' to sell his Pokémon cards to go to the amusement park. He's gotta make $100, 'cause that's how much it costs. He's gonna sell his cards for $1.50 each. He keeps some of 'em for himself, and he's got $50 in cash. 

He's keepin' 1/3 of the cards, so he's sellin' the other 2/3. If he makes $50 from sellin' the cards, that means he's makin' $1.50 per card. 

Let's say he starts with x cards. He's sellin' x - 1/3 cards. Since he's makin' $1.50 per card, the amount of money he makes is 1.5(x - 1/3). 

We know he makes $50 from sellin' the cards, so we can set up the equation: 

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. First, we can get rid of the 0.5 by multiplyin' both sides by 2:

3(x - 1/3) = 100

Now, distribute the 3:

3x - 1 = 100

Add 1 to both sides:

3x = 101

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 33.67

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 33

So, Kenny started with 33 cards.

The final answer is 33."
"So, there's this caterer, right? He's supposed to make hot dogs for 36 people. But he only makes enough for half of them to have two hot dogs. That means he makes hot dogs for 18 people to have two, and the other 18 people get just one.

Then, 40 people show up, and everyone wants a second hot dog. So, the caterer has enough hot dogs for 40 people to have two. That means he has enough for 40 people to have two hot dogs, and 0 people to have just one.

To find out how many people didn't get a second hot dog, we need to subtract the number of people who got two hot dogs from the total number of people. That's 40 - 40 = 0.

So, 0 people didn't get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 0"
"So, there's this lady named Indras, and she's got 6 letters in her name. Now, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and 3 + 4 is 7. That means her sister's name has 7 letters.

So, we gotta add the letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters. That's 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"So, Charlotte went to the kitchen store and bought some stuff. She got a set of pots and pans for $120.00, a set of bowls for $20.00, and 5 utensils for $5.00 each. The total cost of all that stuff is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, the store is having a sale, and everything is 20% off. That means she gets to pay 80% of the original price. To find 80% of $165.00, I'll multiply it by 0.80. So, 0.80 * $165.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order is gonna cost her $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"So, Dora wanna buy some stuff. She got a skipping rope, a board game, and a ball. The rope costs $6, the game costs $11, and the ball costs $2. She already got $2 from her allowance and her mom gave her $16. 

First, we gotta add up how much all the stuff costs: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19. Then we gotta add the money she already got: $2 + $16 = $18. Now, we subtract the money she got from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy all the stuff.

$1"
"So, there's this guy Prince Thaddeus, and he killed 100 dragons with his sword. Then there's Prince Arthur, and he killed three-fourths as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. That's 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons. 

Now, Prince Walter, he killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, he killed 2 * 75 = 150 dragons. 

Lastly, there's Prince Bruce, and he killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. That's 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons."
"So, we got 15 gallons of gas and we wanna know how much Josey needs for her lawnmower. We're told she needs 1/4 of a container. 

To find out how much gas she needs, we gotta divide 15 by 4. That's 15 ÷ 4 = 3.75. 

Now, we gotta convert that to pints. There's 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply 3.75 by 8. That's 3.75 × 8 = 30 pints.

So, Josey needs 30 pints of gas.

The final answer is 30."
"So, George spent $5 and got 1% of his money left. That means he spent 99% of his money. He spent 99% of 5 dollars, which is 0.99 x 5 = 4.95 dollars. 

Now, he spent 4.95 dollars on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so he bought 4.95 / 0.40 = 12.375 bags of chips. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, he bought 12 bags of chips.

He had 1% of his money left, which is 0.01 x 5 = 0.05 dollars. He spent 4.95 - 0.05 = 4.90 dollars on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so he bought 4.90 / 0.75 = 6.53 candy bars. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is 6."
"So, Ray had a bunch of lollipops, like 25. He kept some for himself, 5. Then he gave the rest to his friends. There's 4 friends, right?

So, we gotta take the lollipops he didn't keep, which is 25 - 5 = 20. Now we gotta divide that by 4, 'cause he gave 'em to 4 friends.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each friend got 5 lollipops.

The answer is 5."
"So, there's this cake that weighs 20 ounces. My friend Rory cuts it into 8 pieces, and she and her mom each get a piece. Now, we gotta figure out how much cake is left.

If they each got a piece, that means 2 pieces are gone. So, we gotta subtract 2 from the total weight of the cake. 

20 ounces (total weight) - 2 pieces (that are gone) = 18 ounces

So, the cake weighs 18 ounces now."
"So, Sitti and Juris got some oranges. They got 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. They wanna share 'em with their friends. They got 6 friends, so that's 8 people in total. 

We gotta add up all the oranges they got: 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. Now, we gotta divide the oranges by the number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone gets 7 oranges."
"So, Antoine's got a recipe for french onion soup and he wants to make it bigger. He's gonna use 2 times the amount of onions, which is 2 pounds. He's gonna use 2 pounds of onions and 2 boxes of beef stock. The onions cost $2.00 a pound and the beef stock costs $2.00 a box.

First, let's find out how much the onions cost. 2 pounds of onions * $2.00 a pound is $4.00. Then, the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 a box is $4.00. So, the total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

Now, Antoine's soup serves 6 people. To find out how much it costs per serving, we gotta divide the total cost by the number of servings. So, $8.00 ÷ 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, that's $1.

The final answer is $1."
"So, there's this movie premiere thingy, and these two people, Wayne and Bernadette, they gotta get there. Bernadette's stayin' in a high-rise apartment, and Wayne's stayin' in a hotel. The drive from Bernadette's place takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, so Bernadette's drive takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, Bernadette wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. So, she needs to leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne. That's how much earlier she should leave.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"So, we got a room that's 360 square feet and it's a rectangle. We need to find the perimeter. The length is 3 yards, and we gotta convert that to feet. There's 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can find the width by dividing the area by the length. So, 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we got the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for that is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, it's 2 * (9 + 40). That's 2 * 49, which is 98 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"So, there's these two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth. They bought some beads. Elizabeth got 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth got 1 + 2 * 20 = 41 beads.

Margareth got 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. That's 3 + 4 * 20 = 83 beads.

Now, we gotta find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. We do that by subtractin' Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 83 - 41 = 42.

So, Margareth has 42 more beads than Elizabeth."
"So, Marcus wakes up and his house is 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and the oven makes the house get hotter by 5 degrees every hour. That's like, 15 degrees in total. Then, he opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house gets cooler by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. That's like, 6 degrees in total.

So, we gotta add the 15 degrees from baking and subtract the 6 degrees from cooling. That's 15 - 6 = 9 degrees. 

The house's final temperature is 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"So, there's this guy Jon, and he does a triathlon. He swims for 40 minutes, bikes for 80 minutes, and runs for 50 minutes. He wins by 10 minutes.

Now, there's another guy James, and he's kinda like Jon, but he's faster in the swim. He swims 10% faster, so that's 40 - 4 = 36 minutes. He bikes for 5 minutes longer, so that's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know Jon wins by 10 minutes, so we gotta figure out how long it takes James to run. We can do that by addin' up Jon's times and subtractin' 10 minutes. That's 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. Then we subtract 10 minutes, so that's 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes James to run. We know James bikes for 85 minutes, and Jon bikes for 80 minutes, so James must be faster. We can set up an equation: 36 + 85 + x = 160, where x is how long it takes James to run.

36 + 85 + x = 160

Combine like terms:
121 + x = 160

Subtract 121 from both sides:
x = 39

So, James runs for 39 minutes.

The final answer is 39."
"So, we got this thing about movies, right? There's Movie A, Movie B, and Movie C. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. We gotta convert that to minutes, 'cause that's what we're workin' with. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so...

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to 75 minutes:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. We gotta divide 80 minutes by 4 to find out how long Movie A is:

80 minutes ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"So, there's this fella named Michael, and he's racin' his horse. The horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs. A bale of hay costs three bucks. The horse runs for 30 minutes, and that's 0.5 hours. 

To find out how far the horse went, we gotta convert 30 minutes to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. Now, we multiply the speed of the horse, which is 32 miles per hour, by 0.5 hours. That's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles. 

Since the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, it ate 16 miles * 0.5 bales = 8 bales. Now, we gotta find out how much that costs. 8 bales * 3 bucks per bale = 24 bucks. 

Michael's got 6 five-dollar bills, so he's got 6 * 5 = 30 bucks. Now, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has: 30 - 24 = 6. 

So, Michael's got 6 bucks left."
"So Rozanne's got 4 dozen eggs, that's 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. And she's also got 2 eggs that are loose. So she's got 48 + 2 = 50 eggs. 

Now, she's puttin' out trays that hold 5 glasses, and each glass needs 5 eggs. So, each tray can hold 5 x 5 = 25 eggs. 

To figure out how many trays she can put out, we gotta divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. That's 50 ÷ 25 = 2.

So Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog."
"So, there's this guy Joey, and he's got 214 points in Scrabble. Then he gets 26 points, and that makes it 214 + 26 = 240. 

Now, there's this other lady, Marcy, and she's got 225 points. She gets 10 points, so that's 225 + 10 = 235. 

To figure out how many points Joey's winning, we gotta take Marcy's score and subtract it from Joey's score. That's 240 - 235 = 5. 

So, Joey's winning by 5 points."
"So, there's this fella who bought a bunch of sneakers, 48 of 'em, for $576. He sold 17 of 'em for $20 each, and the rest, 31 of 'em, to a department store for $25 each. 

First, let's figure out how much he made from sellin' those 17 sneakers. That's 17 * $20 = $340. Then, he sold the other 31 sneakers for $25 each, so that's 31 * $25 = $775. 

Now, we gotta add those two numbers together to get the total amount of money he made. $340 + $775 = $1115. 

Finally, we subtract the cost of the sneakers, $576, from the total amount of money he made, $1115. That's $1115 - $576 = $539. 

The answer is $539."
"So Beatrice bought a bunch of crayons. She got some packets with 8 colors in 'em and some with 16 colors in 'em. I counted 'em out. 

She got 6 packets with 8 colors, so that's 6 x 8 = 48 colors. Then she got 4 packets with 16 colors, so that's 4 x 16 = 64 colors. Now I add 'em together: 48 + 64 = 112 colors. That's the total number of colors Beatrice bought.

The answer is 112."
"So, you wanna know the price of a regular popcorn. 

Well, let's think about it. If you buy a super ticket for $20, that's like, a whole bundle deal. You get a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. That's a pretty good deal, right? But, you didn't buy the super ticket, so you saved $2. That means the regular price of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda is $20 - $2 = $18.

Now, the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the regular price of the movie ticket is $20 - $1 = $19. But, you said the movie ticket costs $12, so that's good. 

The thing is, you gotta pay for the soda, and it costs $3. So, the popcorn costs $19 - $12 = $7. 

The final answer is: $7"
"So, there's this thing about helium balloons, right? They cost $900 to fill 20 of 'em. Then, two days later, the price goes up by $20. That means each balloon now costs $55. 

To find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons, I just multiply 170 by 55. That's 170 x 55 = $9350."
"So, there's this car that's drivin' on the road, right? It's goin' 60 miles per hour for a bit, then it slows down to 30 miles per hour for a bit. We gotta figure out how fast it's goin' on average.

First, we gotta find out how far it went. So, it's goin' 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it's goin' 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, that's 30 * 1 = 30 miles. So, the total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Now, we gotta figure out how long it took in total. It took 2 hours to go 120 miles, and then 1 more hour to go 30 miles, so the total time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. That's 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The car's average speed is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Jenna got 8 sapphires and then she traded 3 of 'em for some rubies. That means she's got 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

Now, we gotta figure out how much them sapphires are worth. I think it's like, 5 sapphires * $800 per sapphire. That's 5 * 800 = $4000. 

Then, she got 2 rubies, and I think they're worth like, 2 * $1200. That's 2 * 1200 = $2400. 

So, the total value of all her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400."
"So, there's this guy Marin and his neighbor Nancy, and they both eat apples. They eat 4 apples each day. We need to figure out how many apples they eat in 30 days.

Let's see... if they eat 4 apples each day, that's 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day. Now, we gotta multiply that by 30 days. That's 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

So, they eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"So, Bob needs potting soil for his garden. He's got 10 raised beds, and each one is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. I think he needs to know how much soil he needs.

To figure that out, I'm gonna multiply the length, width, and height of one bed. That's 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. Now, I'm gonna multiply that by 10, 'cause he's got 10 beds. That's 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, so I'm gonna divide 320 by 2. That's 320 ÷ 2 = 160 bags. Now, I'm gonna multiply 160 by the price of one bag, which is $12. That's 160 x $12 = $1920.

So, Bob's gonna need $1920 worth of potting soil.

The final answer is: $1920"
"So, there's this thing about magicians' cards. They got 15 red cards, and there's more green cards than that. Like, a lot more. We need to figure out how many more green cards there are. To do that, we gotta find 60% of 15. That's like, 0.6 times 15. 

0.6 * 15 = 9

So, there's 9 more green cards than red cards. That means there's 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, we know there's 15 red cards, 24 green cards, and some yellow cards. The yellow cards are the same as the sum of red and green cards. So, we add those together.

15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

So, there's 39 yellow cards.

To find the total number of cards, we add 'em all together.

15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

The answer is 78."
"So, there's this girl Katelyn, and she sees 50 fairies flyin' around. Then, 20 minutes pass, and her friend sees half as many fairies comin' from the east. That means 50 / 2 = 25 more fairies show up. Now, there's 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Then, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies fly away. So, we gotta subtract 30 from 75. That's 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left.

The answer is 45."
"So, there's this lady with a dog, and her dog has 8 puppies. 3 of 'em have spots. Then there's this other guy, Brandon, and his dog has 12 puppies, 4 of 'em have spots. We gotta figure out what percentage of all the puppies have spots.

First, we gotta add up all the puppies. So, 8 (the lady's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20 puppies.

Now, we gotta find out how many of 'em have spots. The lady's dog has 3, and Brandon's dog has 4. So, 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage, we gotta divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20), and then multiply by 100. That's like, 7 ÷ 20 = 0.35, and then 0.35 × 100 = 35%.

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"So, the farmer is buyin' a lotta feed for his horses. He buys 2 boxes of them fancy sugar cubes, 4 big bags of carrots, 42 big bales of hay, and 20 sacks of oats. 

First, we gotta figure out how much all the feed weighs. 

2 boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds, 4 bags of carrots weigh 48 pounds, 42 bales of hay weigh 3150 pounds, and 20 sacks of oats weigh 1300 pounds. 

Add 'em all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds. 

Now, the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we gotta divide the total weight by the truck's capacity. 

4400 / 2250 = 1.96. 

Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer's gotta make 2 trips to get all the feed."
"So, Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?

To figure this out, we gotta do some math. She gets 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, that's 3 * 2 = 6 cents from cans. Then, she gets 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. That's 5 * 3 = 15 cents from bottles. So, in total, she gets 6 + 15 = 21 cents a week.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause there's 4 weeks in a month. 21 * 4 = 84 cents. That's how much she makes in a month.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there's this lady named Shondra, and she's got some plants. There's another lady named Toni, and she's got more plants than this Frederick guy. Frederick's got 10 plants. Toni's got 60% more plants than Frederick. To figure out how many plants Toni's got, we gotta do some math.

First, we gotta find 60% of Frederick's plants. That's 0.6 times 10, which is 6. Then we add that to Frederick's plants, and that's 10 + 6, which is 16. So Toni's got 16 plants.

Now, we gotta figure out how many plants Shondra's got. We know she's got 7 fewer plants than Toni. So we take Toni's plants, 16, and subtract 7. That's 16 - 7, which is 9. So Shondra's got 9 plants.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Ali had some money, like $21. Then, this Leila lady gave him half of her money. She had $100, so half of that is $50. Now Ali has $21 + $50. That's $71."
"So, there's this lady Ashley, and she ordered a pizza that costs $15. She wants to give a tip that's 1/5 of the price she paid. To find out how much she should give, we gotta do some math.

We take the price of the pizza, which is $15, and we divide it by 5. That's 'cause 1/5 is the same as dividing by 5. So, $15 ÷ 5 = $3.

Now, we add that to the price of the pizza, which is $15. So, $15 + $3 = $18.

So, Ashley should give the delivery guy $18."
"So, Finley was doin' pretty good at first, she was in first place. Then she fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. After that, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. Then she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she was in 6th place again.

She finished in 6th place."
"So, Miss Maria got a bunch of cards, right? She had 6 decks of basketball cards, and each deck had 25 cards. That's a lotta cards! And she also had 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box had 40 cards. That's even more cards!

So, let's count 'em up. Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards = 150 cards. Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards = 200 cards. Now, add 'em together: 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Miss Maria kept 50 cards for herself, so she gave away 350 - 50 = 300 cards. Now, she gave 10 cards to each student. How many students did she give cards to? Well, we gotta divide 300 by 10. That's 300 ÷ 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"So, Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. That's 20 x 0.45, which is 9 dollars. She got a dollar off, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. That's 20 x 0.50, which is 10 dollars. She got 10% off, which is 10% of 10, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount. That's 9 - 8, which is 1 dollar.

The final answer is: $1"
"So, there's this guy Bob, and he's in charge of doin' laundry for a big hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets, and twice as many towels as pillow cases. We gotta figure out how many pieces of laundry there are in 80 rooms.

Let's start with the sheets. There's 2 sheets per room. Then there's the comforter, which is 1 per room. Now, the pillow cases are twice as many as the sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases per room. And the towels are twice as many as the pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels per room.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room. We got 80 rooms, so we multiply 15 by 80 to get the total number of pieces of laundry.

15 * 80 = 1200

The answer is 1200."
"So, Fireman Frank got some shoes. He had 200. Then he got 5 more on Monday. That's 200 + 5 = 205. Then he got 15 more on Wednesday. That's 205 + 15 = 220. Then he got 30 more on Friday. That's 220 + 30 = 250. Then he gave away 180 on Saturday. That's 250 - 180 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, Mary got 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can make 8 cupcakes. We need to know how many cupcakes she can make in total. 

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to know how many cupcakes can fit in one pan. It's 12 cupcakes. We need to divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans Mary needs.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary needs 4 pans of cupcakes."
"So, Theo bought a pen for $2 and some paper. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. That means the paper cost 3 * 2 = 6, and then 6 - 1 = 5. So the paper cost $5.

The total cost of the things she bought is 2 + 5 = 7. She gave the cashier 10 dollars. To find out how much change she got, we need to subtract 7 from 10. 10 - 7 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"So, there's this class with 30 students, and each student starts with 10 pencils. Then, after two months, they use 1/5 of all the pencils. That means they used 60 pencils. So, they got 300 - 60 = 240 pencils left.

Now, at the end of the year, they got 1/3 of those pencils left. That's 1/3 of 240, which is 80 pencils.

The answer is 80."
"So, Matt wants cookies, but his dad says he gotta eat healthy stuff first. He says Matt can have half as many cookies as the carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleanin' his room. Matt wants 5 cookies in total. We gotta figure out how many carrot sticks he needs.

Let's say Matt eats x carrot sticks. He gets half as many cookies as that, so that's x/2 cookies. And he gets 2 extra cookies for cleanin' his room. So, we can make an equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2. That gives us x + 4 = 10.

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by subtractin' 4 from both sides. That gives us x = 6.

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

The answer is 6."
"So, there's this shark, right? It's 10 feet long. And it's got 2 remoras attached to it. The remoras are 6 inches long, but we need to convert that to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is 0.5 feet. 

So, the remoras are 2 * 0.5 feet long, which is 1 foot. Now, we need to figure out what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long. 

To find the percentage, we divide the remoras' length by the shark's length, then multiply by 100. That's (1 / 10) * 100, which is 10%. 

So, the remoras take up 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is 10."
"So, there's this thing about a grade level where most kids got a computer at home. It's like, three-fourths of 'em do. And we know that 20 kids don't have one. We need to figure out how many kids are in that grade.

Let's say the total number of kids is x. If three-fourths of 'em got a computer, that means the other one-fourth didn't. So, we can say that one-fourth of the kids is 20. To find the total number of kids, we can multiply 20 by 4.

20 * 4 = 80

So, there's 80 kids in that grade."
"So, Jason wanna break in them new shoes in three weeks, right? He's gonna walk 4 days a week. We gotta figure out how long he's gotta walk each day.

First, we gotta know how many days he's gonna walk in three weeks. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 3 weeks by 7 days.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we gotta divide the total minutes (240) by the total days (21).

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk about 11.43 minutes each day for 4 days a week to break in them new shoes in three weeks.

The answer is: 11.43"
"So, Sarah went to the store and bought some books. She spent a lot of money, like $300. Each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we gotta divide the money by the price of one book.

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Now, she gave some books to her 4 kids. We need to find out how many books each kid got. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

So, each kid got 5 books."
"So, there's this class of kids, right? And some of 'em are allergic to dairy, some to peanuts, and some to both. I counted 'em up, and I found out that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. 

Now, I gotta figure out how many kids aren't allergic to anything. I'm thinkin' I gotta add up the ones allergic to dairy and peanuts, but then I gotta subtract the ones that are allergic to both 'cause they got counted twice. So, I add 9 (dairy) and 6 (peanuts), that's 15. Then I subtract 3 (the ones allergic to both), that leaves me with 12.

Now, I gotta subtract that from the total number of kids in the class, which is 32. So, 32 minus 12 is 20. That means 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

The answer is 20."
"So, there's this company and they're takin' their employees on a tour. They got 3 groups, and each group has 200 people in it. They also got 7 tour guides. I'm not really sure why they need that many guides, but I guess they wanna make sure everyone's taken care of.

So, to find out how many people are goin' on the tour, I just multiply the number of groups by the number of people in each group. That's 3 groups times 200 people, which is 600. Then, I add the 7 tour guides to that number. That's 600 plus 7, which is 607.

The final answer is 607."
"So, Tom's wife is gettin' an anniversary trip, huh? He's buyin' plane tickets for her and he's payin' $5000 each. That's a total of $10,000 for the two of 'em.

Now, the hotel's gonna be more expensive 'cause it's a busy weekend. The regular price is $1500 a day, but it's 20% more. That's like, $300 more. So, the new price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 a day. They're stayin' for 3 days, so that's 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Addin' the plane tickets and the hotel, we get $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"So, there's this guy Ben, and he's got 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Now, there's this other guy Jasper, and he's got half as many blue tubes as Ben, which means he's got 4 / 2 = 2 blue tubes. And Jasper's also got three times as many yellow tubes as Ben, so he's got 3 * 3 = 9 yellow tubes.

So, in total, Jasper's got 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint."
"So, there's this Belen lady, and she got two pennies. One's from 1959 and the other's from 2010. The 2010 penny is lighter than the 1959 penny, and it's only three-quarters as heavy. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. We gotta figure out how much the 2010 penny weighs.

Three-quarters of 48 is 36, so the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, we add the weights of both pennies together. 48 (1959 penny) + 36 (2010 penny) = 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, Keegan and Tashay are tryin' to raise money for a baseball camp. They need $200. By 3 pm, Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91. Let's add those two numbers together: $83 + $91 = $174. Now, we gotta see how much more they need. We take the goal, $200, and subtract $174. That's $200 - $174 = $26. They need $26 more.

The final answer is: $26"
"So, there's this guy Gabriel and he's got a music player that can hold 100 songs. He's already got 20 songs on it. Now, there's this other guy Luri, and he's got 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, Luri's got 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to figure out how many more songs Luri can add to his player. Gabriel's player can hold 100 songs, and he's already got 20, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri's player can hold 100 songs, and he's already got 60, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

So, Luri can add 40 more songs, and Gabriel can add 80 more songs. To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we need to subtract 40 from 80.

80 - 40 = 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"So, there's this fella Stetson, and he made a bet with Alec. He's gotta give up 10 bucks for every orange he eats. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of 'em. To figure out how much money he gave up, we gotta do some math.

We gotta find 2/5 of 60. That's like, 2 groups of 5, so it's 2 * 5 = 10. Then we gotta divide that by 5, so it's 10 / 5 = 2. That means Stetson ate 2 groups of 5 oranges, and that's 2 * 10 = 20 bucks.

So, Stetson gave up 20 bucks.

The final answer is: $20"
"So, I gotta figure out how much Jillian's handbag cost. She said it cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. Her shoes cost $80. 

First, I gotta do 3 times the cost of her shoes. That's 3 * $80 = $240. 

Then, I gotta subtract $20 from that. So, $240 - $20 = $220. 

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"So, James runs 12 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week. That's a lot of runnin'! To figure out how many hours he runs, we gotta multiply the miles by the days. 

12 miles * 5 days = 60 miles

Now, we gotta convert miles to hours. James runs 10 miles per hour. So, we divide the total miles by 10.

60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"So, Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse eats five pounds of oats twice a day. That's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse. He's got four horses, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

Now, he's gonna need oats for five days. That's 40 * 5 = 200 pounds. Each bag of oats weighs 50 pounds. So, we gotta divide 200 by 50 to see how many bags he needs. That's 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses.

Final answer: 4"
"So, Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of 'em are Pomeranians. That means 18 of 'em are Pomeranians. Now, we gotta find out how many of those Pomeranians are girls. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, we gotta divide 18 by 3. That's 6. So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"So, we gotta find the average of the highest temperatures in these three places. I think I got it right.

There's Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia. The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. That's really, really cold. Then there's Northlandia, which is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. That's kinda nice, I guess. And Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. That's not too bad, I suppose.

So, let's add 'em up: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30. Now, we gotta divide by 3, 'cause we're findin' the average. -30 divided by 3 is... -10.

So, the average highest temperature is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is -10."
"So, there's this kid who wants a toy car that costs $12. He already has $4. He's gonna save $2 every day from his allowance. We need to figure out how many days it'll take him to save enough money to buy the toy.

Let's do the math. He needs $12 - $4 = $8 more. He saves $2 a day. So, we divide $8 by $2. That's 4. He'll need 4 days to save enough money to buy the toy."
"So, Jaime got some eggs and he's tryin' to put 'em on trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and he's got 2 trays. He's got a total of 64 eggs. 

To figure out how many eggs he can't put on the tray, we gotta subtract the number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs. 

So, 64 eggs minus 48 eggs (2 trays * 24 eggs) is 16 eggs. That's how many eggs Jaime can't put on the tray.

The answer is 16."
"So, Sally buys one small pizza and one big pizza. The small pizza costs $8. The big pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. That means the big pizza costs 3 x $8 = $24. 

To find out how much Sally spent, we add the cost of the small pizza and the big pizza. $8 + $24 = $32."
"So, there's this lady named Heather and she's buyin' razors. They come in packs of 4 and cost $4 each. But right now, she's gettin' one free with every pack she buys. And she's also got a $2 coupon. 

So, she's gonna buy 2 packs, but she only pays for 1 pack 'cause of the free one. That pack costs $4. After she uses her $2 coupon, she's payin' $2. 

Now, there's 4 razors in a pack, so we gotta figure out how much each one costs. We take the $2 and divide it by 4. That's $2 ÷ 4 = $0.50. 

To get the price in cents, we multiply by 100. So, $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents. 

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this thing about cheerleaders and a pyramid. They got 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and the 10th one is 60 inches tall. They stack 'em up like that: 4 on the bottom, 3 on top of 4, 2 on top of 3, and the shortest one on top.

First, we gotta figure out the height of the bottom layer. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we multiply 4 by 64 to get the total height of the bottom layer: 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

Next, we got the next layer, which is 3 girls standin' on top of the 4. Again, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, so we multiply 3 by 64 to get the total height of this layer: 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

Then, we got the next layer, which is 2 girls standin' on top of the 3. You guessed it, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, so we multiply 2 by 64 to get the total height of this layer: 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl is 60 inches tall, and she's on top, so we just add that to the total: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 576 inches.

Now, we gotta convert that to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 576 by 12 to get the total height in feet: 576 ÷ 12 = 48 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"So, Charisma works for 8 hours a day. That's a lotta hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so she works 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. 

She's gotta get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour. That's 8 hours * 5 minutes = 40 minutes per day. 

After 5 days, she's walked 40 * 5 = 200 minutes."
"So, there's this fella named Brett, and he's 14 years old. Now, his sister Angela, she's gonna be three times as old as Brett is now in four years. That means in four years, Angela's gonna be 3 times 14, which is 42. 

So, if Angela's gonna be 42 in four years, we gotta subtract 4 from 42 to find out how old she is now. That's 42 - 4 = 38.

The final answer is 38."
"So, there's this guy Paul, and he's drivin' a car twice a day, once in the mornin' and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Each mornin' ride costs him about $6, and each afternoon ride costs him about $2.

Let's see, he's doin' this for 14 days, so that's 2 rides a day. That's 2 * 14 = 28 rides. Now, we gotta figure out how much he spent.

For the mornin' rides, he's spendin' $6 per ride, so 28 rides would be 28 * 6 = $168. That's a lotta money!

For the afternoon rides, he's spendin' $2 per ride, so 28 rides would be 28 * 2 = $56. That's not as much as the mornin' rides, but still a pretty penny.

So, we add 'em together: $168 (mornin' rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224. That's the total amount of money Paul spent on drivin' his car.

The final answer is: $224"
"So, there's this lady Ashley, and she got 5 boxes of oranges, and each box had 10 oranges in it. That's like, 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. Then there's this other lady Brianne, and she got 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, that's 50 + 20 = 70 oranges for her.

Now, they wanna make these greek orange pies, and each pie needs 3 oranges. So, we gotta divide the total number of oranges by 3. That's 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Now, let's divide 120 by 3. That's 120 ÷ 3 = 40.

So, they can make 40 greek orange pies."
"So, there's this guy Mark, and he's tryin' to pick a place for his wife's surprise party. There's two places he's lookin' at. One place costs $200 no matter how many people come, and the other place costs $25 per person. But, the first place don't come with food, and the food for the second place is already included.

Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The first place costs $200 plus $5 for each guest, so it's like 200 + 5x. The second place costs $25 per guest, so it's just 25x.

We wanna know when these two places cost the same, so we set 'em equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x. Now, let's get rid of the 5x on the left side by subtractin' 5x from both sides. That leaves us with 200 = 20x.

Next, we divide both sides by 20, and that gives us 10 = x. So, 10 guests is the magic number where the two places cost the same.

The answer is 10."
"So, there's this thing about three people findin' insects. They got 43 in total. Lily found more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. We gotta figure out how many each one found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Then David found x/2 insects, and Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know the total is 43, so we add 'em up: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43. We can combine the x's: 2x + 7 = 43. Then we subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 36. Now we divide by 2: x = 18.

Now we know Bodhi found 18 insects. To find out how many Lily found, we take half of 18 and add 7: 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, there's this lady, Mariah, and her grandma, and they're knittin'. Mariah uses 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma uses 1/2 of a skein. A skein of yarn got 364 yards in it. We gotta figure out how many yards they used altogether.

To do that, we gotta do some math. Mariah uses 1/4 of 364, which is 91 yards. Her grandma uses 1/2 of 364, which is 182 yards. Now we add 'em together: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

The final answer is: 273"
"So, Cherrie's friends want some gifts. Two of 'em want 5 gifts each, and three of 'em want 2 gifts each. We gotta count 'em all up.

For the two friends who want 5 gifts, we do 2 x 5, which is 10. Then we do 3 x 2 for the other friends, which is 6. Now we add 'em together: 10 + 6 = 16.

Then, Cherrie gets 10 more gifts. We add those to the 16: 16 + 10 = 26.

The answer is 26."
"So, there's this chair, and it's 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, we gotta figure out how long the couch is. It's 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so it's 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry gum, and she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. She also bought a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. 

If she paid $7 in total, we gotta figure out how much she paid for the strawberry gum. We know she paid $3 for the grape and green apple gum. So, we subtract that from the total: $7 - $3 = $4. That's how much she paid for the strawberry gum. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, we gotta divide that by 2: $4 ÷ 2 = $2. 

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, Frederick is makin' popsicle sticks to sell and stuff. He's tryin' to save money by buyin' his own sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He's got $24 to spend on wood. A 2 x 4 costs $4 and a 2 x 8 costs $6.

Let's see which one's cheaper. For the 2 x 4, he gets 200 sticks for $4, so that's $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick. For the 2 x 8, he gets 400 sticks for $6, so that's $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick. The 2 x 8 is cheaper.

Now, let's see how many sticks he can make with $24. He can buy 4 of the 2 x 8 for $24, and that's 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

The answer is 1600."
"So, Mario's got 6 sled dogs and he needs snowshoes for 'em. Each snowshoe costs $12.00. To find out how much it's gonna cost, we gotta multiply the number of dogs by the cost of the snowshoes.

Let's do the math: 6 dogs * $12.00 = ?

I think it's... $72.00! That's right, it's gonna cost Mario $72.00 to get snowshoes for all his dogs.

The final answer is: $72."
"So, there's this lady named Janet. She takes the bus to work 5 days a week. She takes 2 trips a day. That's 2 * 5 = 10 trips. Each trip costs her $2.20. So, 10 trips would cost her 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly pass for $20, she'll save $22 - $20 = $2.

The answer is $2."
"So, there's this farm and a zoo, right? The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so it has 30 * 2 = 60 cows. 

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep. The zoo has 20 * 2 = 40 sheep.

Now, let's add 'em up: 
Farm: 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 40 sheep = 100 animals

So, the farm and zoo got 50 + 100 = 150 animals in total.

$oxed{150}$"
"So, Rose bought a lot of onions and potatoes. She bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. If Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, that means Sophia bought 1/4 of what Rose bought.

For onions: 12 / 4 = 3
For potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato."
"So, Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. He needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. We gotta figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day to reach his goal.

First, let's find out how many days he has to lose the weight. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (we don't count February 29th since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days until his birthday. That's a total of 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 212 days.

Now, we need to divide the total calories he needs to burn (30 pounds * 3500 calories per pound) by the number of days he has to lose the weight. 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories. 105,000 calories / 212 days = approximately 496 calories per day.

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of about 496 calories each day to reach his goal."
"So, Gerald gets paid $30 a day. He works for a whole week, that's 7 days. So, he makes 7 x $30 = $210. 

He spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we gotta subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made. So, $210 - $100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: $110"
"So, there's this girl Hannah, and she's supposed to run 8 laps at the gym. Each lap is 0.25 kilometers long. She needs to drink 60 milliliters of water for every kilometer she runs. To figure out how much water she needs, we gotta multiply the number of laps by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.

So, we got 8 laps, and she needs 60 milliliters per kilometer. Multiply 'em together: 8 * 60 = 480 milliliters.

The answer is 480."
"So, Julie had some money, like $500. Then she spent some of it on clothes, which is 20% of the money. That's like, 20% of 500, which is 100 bucks. So, she had 500 - 100 = 400 bucks left.

Then, she spent some more money on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining money. That's 25% of 400, which is 100 bucks. So, she had 400 - 100 = 300 bucks left.

So, Julie had 300 bucks left.

300"
"So, there's this thing about a house and a lot. They cost a total of $120,000. The thing is, the house costs three times as much as the lot. I think I figured it out. If you add the cost of the house and the lot together, you get $120,000. If the house costs three times as much as the lot, that means the lot costs one-third of the total. So, you gotta divide $120,000 by 4 to find the cost of the lot. 

$120,000 ÷ 4 = $30,000

So, the lot costs $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much, the house costs 3 x $30,000 = $90,000.

The house costs $90,000."
"So, Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack cost $4. She had 8 bags in total, so she spent 8 * 4 = 32 dollars.

Then, she sold each bag for 8 dollars. So, she made 8 * 8 = 64 dollars.

To find out how much money she made, we need to subtract the money she spent from the money she made. 64 - 32 = 32.

So, Tara made 32 dollars."
"So, Joe throws 25 punches per minute, and a fight is 5 rounds of 3 minutes each. We gotta figure out how many punches he threw in total.

Let's see... if he throws 25 punches per minute, and there's 15 minutes in the fight (5 rounds x 3 minutes each), we multiply 25 by 15.

25 x 15 = 375

So, Joe threw 375 punches in the fight."
"So, there's this bake-off thingy, and Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so we gotta divide 36 by 4. That's 36 ÷ 4 = 9. Josh made 9 cookies.

Now, Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh. So, we multiply 9 by 2. That's 9 × 2 = 18. Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Ali got some money from workin' on Mr. James' farm. He had 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. Let's see how much he had in total. 

He had 4 $10 bills, that's 4 x 10 = 40 bucks. And he had 6 $20 bills, that's 6 x 20 = 120 bucks. So, he had 40 + 120 = 160 bucks.

Then, he gave his sister half of that money. Half of 160 is 160 / 2 = 80 bucks. So, he gave her 80 bucks and was left with 160 - 80 = 80 bucks.

After that, he bought dinner and spent 3/5 of the remaining money. 3/5 of 80 is (3/5) x 80 = 48 bucks. So, he spent 48 bucks on dinner and was left with 80 - 48 = 32 bucks.

The final answer is 32."
"So, there's this guy Rob, and he takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to figure out how long it takes Royce. 

First, we gotta convert 2 hours into minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. 

Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we gotta double the time it takes Rob, which is 120 minutes, and add 40 minutes. That's 120 + 40 = 160 minutes.

So, it takes Royce 160 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 160"
"So Martha's got 3 grandkids, and she's makin' 'em some winter clothes. She's makin' a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each one. 

She needs 2 skeins for a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. 

Let's see how many skeins she'll need in total. 

She's makin' 3 hats, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 skeins. 
She's makin' 3 scarves, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 skeins. 
She's makin' 3 sweaters, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 skeins. 
She's makin' 3 pairs of mittens, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 skeins. 
She's makin' 3 pairs of socks, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

So, Martha needs 63 skeins of wool."
"So, Chris is doin' his math homework. He's got 100 problems to do. He does 12 on Monday. Then he does 3 times as many on Tuesday, which is 3 * 12 = 36. So now he's done 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

He's got 100 - 48 = 52 problems left. Then, on Wednesday, he does a quarter of those, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13. So now he's done 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

That means he's got 100 - 61 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

The final answer is 39."
"So, there's this strawberry-pickin' thing goin' on at Grandma Concetta's farm. I heard Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Then there's Bobby, and he picks one less quart than Tony, so he picks 5 quarts per hour. Kathy's the one who picks twice as many as Bobby, so she picks 10 quarts per hour. And Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add 'em up: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29.

The answer is 29."
"So, they baked 200 loaves of bread. Then they sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon. That's a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. But then, 6 loaves came back. So, we gotta subtract the ones sold from the ones they had, and then add the ones that came back. That's 200 - 132 = 68. Then, 68 + 6 = 74.

The answer is 74."
"So, there's this fella named Jackson, and he's plantin' tulips. He can fit 6 red ones in a row and 8 blue ones in a row. He buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. We gotta figure out how many rows he can plant.

First, we do the red ones. 36 divided by 6 is... 6. That's how many rows of red tulips he can plant.

Then, we do the blue ones. 24 divided by 8 is... 3. That's how many rows of blue tulips he can plant.

Now, we gotta see which one's smaller. 3 is smaller than 6, so he can plant 3 rows of flowers in total.

The final answer is 3."
"So, there's this lady named Heather, and she got a big ol' bag of raisins. It's got 27 cups in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. The oatmeal cookies need 3/4 of a cup of raisins each. 

To figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we gotta divide the raisins by the amount needed for one batch. So, we do 27 cups divided by 3/4 cup. That's like 27 times 4, then divided by 3. 

27 * 4 = 108
108 / 3 = 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The answer is 36."
"So, Ada's electric bill is 12 kilowatts per hour. She's gonna add a new thingy that uses 2 kilowatts per hour. That's like, 14 kilowatts now. 

We gotta figure out how much it costs. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 14 kilowatts by 7. That's 98 kilowatt-hours. Now we gotta multiply that by the price, which is $1.50. That's 98 * 1.50 = $147.

Now, we gotta find out how much it was before. We do the same thing, 12 kilowatts times 7, that's 84 kilowatt-hours. Then we multiply that by the price, 84 * 1.50 = $126.

The difference is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"So, we got a person who can paint half a house in 5 days, right? That means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. Now, if we got 5 of 'em, they can paint a whole house in 10 days, but we gotta think about how many days in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so 10 days is 1 and 3/7 of a week. If 5 people can paint a whole house in 1 and 3/7 of a week, then they can paint a whole house in 7 days. Now, we gotta think about how many hours in a day. There's 24 hours in a day, so 7 days is 7 * 24 = 168 hours.

Final answer: 168"
"So, there's this lady Ophelia and this other lady Jenna, they live in the same apartment. They got 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and Jenna got 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Ophelia got 20 sofas. 

We need to figure out how many chairs Ophelia got. We can do that by figuring out how many chairs Jenna got. Since Jenna got 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply Ophelia's chairs by 3. But first, we gotta figure out how many chairs Ophelia got. We know Ophelia got 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can set up an equation: 20 = x - 2, where x is the number of chairs Ophelia got. Solving for x, we get x = 20 + 2, which is x = 22. So Ophelia got 22 chairs.

Now we know Jenna got 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna got 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"So, Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. He paid a total of $48. If he didn't buy the headphone set, how many CDs could he have bought?

To figure this out, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid. The headphone set cost $44. So, we subtract $44 from $48.

$48 - $44 = $4

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD, which is $4. 

$4 ÷ $4 = 1

So, Tom could have bought 1 more CD if he didn't buy the headphone set.

$1"
"So, Josh worked out for 8 weeks. He worked out 4 hours a week for some weeks, but not all of 'em. He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks, and 6 hours for one week. I'm gonna count the hours for each type of week.

He worked 4 hours a week for 5 weeks, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 hours. Then, he worked 5 hours for 2 weeks, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 hours. And he worked 6 hours for one week, so that's just 6 hours.

Now, I'm gonna add up all the hours: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"So, there's this bus with 48 people on it. Then, 8 people get off at the first stop. That leaves 48 - 8 = 40 people. Then, 5 times as many people as the ones who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. That's 5 * 8 = 40 people. So now there's 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 21 people get off, so there's 80 - 21 = 59 people left. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, there's 59 + 63 = 122 people on the bus now.

The final answer is 122."
"So, there's this guy Jame, and he's gonna be 27 in 5 years. That means he's 22 now. 

Now, there's this other guy, Jame's cousin. In 8 years, he's gonna be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin is gonna be 2 x 27 - 5, which is 49. But we need to know how old he is now. So, we subtract 8 from 49, and that's 41. 

So, Jame's cousin is 41 now. The difference between Jame's age and his cousin's age is 22 - 41, which is -19. But that can't be right, 'cause you can't have a negative age difference. So, we need to flip it around. Jame's cousin is 41, and Jame is 22. That's a 19-year difference.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"So, there's this guy Errol, and he bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. The computer cost $1,100. 

To find out how much the printer cost, we gotta subtract $400 from $1,100. That's $1,100 - $400 = $700. 

Now, we gotta find out how much the monitors cost. We know the computer and printer cost $2,400 together, and we know the computer and printer cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. So, the monitors cost $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

Since there are 2 monitors, we gotta divide $600 by 2. That's $600 / 2 = $300.

The answer is $300."
"So, there's this thing about 20 kids goin' on a school trip. They split into two groups, boys and girls. The boys went out and brought back 60 shells each. That's 60 * 10 = 600 shells in total.

The girls brought back some shells too. They brought back 4 times as many shells as the boys, plus the number of shells the boys brought. So, that's 4 * 60 = 240, plus 60, which is 300 shells in total.

Now, we gotta figure out how many shells the girls brought back each. We know there are 10 girls, so we divide 300 by 10. That's 30 shells per girl.

The final answer is 30."
"So, there's this guy Nick and he's got a lot of candies. Then there's this other guy George and he's got fewer candies. They're like, equal at first, but then George eats some. Now George has 3 candies left. We gotta figure out how many candies Nick had.

So, George had some candies, and then he ate 5. That means he had 3 left, so before he ate, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Now, Nick had twice as many candies as George. So, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The answer is 16."
"So, there's this girl Chenny, she's 10 years old. Then there's Alyana, she's 4 years younger than Chenny. That means Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Now, we got Anne, she's 2 years older than Alyana. So, Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

The answer is 8."
"So, we got four books here. The first one is 31 mm thick. The second one is 50 mm thick. The third one is 5 mm less than the second one, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm. The fourth one is twice as thick as the first one, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm.

Now, let's add 'em up: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The answer is 188."
"So, Emma made some vlogs already. She made 18 in the first week, 21 in the second week, and 15 in the third week. Let's add those numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54. 

Now, we need to know how many vlogs she needs to make to reach 72. To do that, we need to subtract 54 from 72. 72 - 54 = 18.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach 72."
"So, my wife wants me to pay an extra 20% of the $50 dinner bill. I gotta figure out how much that is. 

20% of $50 is like, um... 20 out of 100, right? So I gotta find 20 out of 100 of 50. 

I think I can do that... 20 * 0.2 = 4. So, 20% of 50 is 4. 

Now, I add that to the original bill: 50 + 4 = 54. 

So, I gotta pay 54 dollars."
"So, there's this boy and he gets $18, but it's shared among 3 boys, so he gets $18 / 3 = $6. Then he adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21. After that, he spends $8, so he's left with $21 - $8 = $13. Then, he saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The answer is $39."
"So, Elvis wants to save a lot of money, like, a lot. He's got a goal of saving $1125 a month. Now, he wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. That's like, if he saves a certain amount in the first half, he'll save twice that amount in the second half.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars a day in the first half. Then, he'll save 2x dollars a day in the second half. We know he saves a total of $1125 in the whole month, and there are 30 days in April. So, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much he needs to save in the second half: $1125 / 2 = $562.50.

Now, we know that Elvis saves x dollars a day in the first half, and he saves 2x dollars a day in the second half. We can set up an equation to figure out how much he saves in the first half: x * 15 = 562.50. But wait, that's not right. We can't just multiply 15 by x, 'cause that's not how it works.

Let's try again. If Elvis saves x dollars a day in the first half, and he saves 2x dollars a day in the second half, then we can set up the equation: x * 15 = 2x * 15. But that's still not right. We need to figure out how many days are in the first half of the month. There are 15 days in the first half of April.

So, let's try again. If Elvis saves x dollars a day in the first half, and he saves 2x dollars a day in the second half, then we can set up the equation: x * 15 = 2x * 15. But that's still not right. We need to figure out how much Elvis saves in the first half. We know he saves a total of $562.50 in the second half, and that's twice as much as he saves in the first half. So, we can divide $562.50 by 2 to find out how much he saves in the first half: $562.50 / 2 = $281.25.

Now we know Elvis saves $281.25 in the first half, and that's 15 days. So, we can divide $281.25 by 15 to find out how much he saves per day in the first half: $281.25 / 15 = $18.75.

Now that we know Elvis saves $18.75 in the first half, we can find out how much he saves in the second half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, we can multiply $18.75 by 2: $18.75 * 2 = $37.50.

The final answer is: $37.50"
"So, Verna bought some fruit. She got 3 apples, 5 oranges, and 6 peaches. The apples cost $1.50 each, the oranges cost $0.80 each, and the peaches cost $0.75 each. She gave $20.

First, I'm gonna calculate the cost of the apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
Then, I'm gonna calculate the cost of the oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
And the cost of the peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, I'm gonna add 'em all together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so I'm gonna subtract $13.00 from $20 to find out how much change she got: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"So, Jairus and Jenny did some tasks. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and Jenny gets $0.5. They both did 20 tasks. 

Jairus did 20 tasks, so he got 20 x $0.8 = $16. Jenny did 20 tasks, so she got 20 x $0.5 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus got than Jenny, we need to subtract Jenny's money from Jairus's money. $16 - $10 = $6.

The answer is $6."
"So, there's this guy Jeff and this other guy Brad, and they're tryin' to split 100 bucks. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. We need to figure out how much Jeff gets.

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then Jeff gets 4x dollars. We know the total is 100 bucks, so we gotta add 'em together:

x + 4x = 100

Now, let's combine these x's:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So, Brad gets 20 bucks. Now, we need to find out how much Jeff gets. We know Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so:

Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 bucks

The final answer is: 80"
"So, there's this fella named Jeff, and he's gotta walk to work and back home every day. His work is 3 miles away. That means he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, so that's 3 + 3 = 6 miles per day.

Now, he's gotta do this 5 days a week. So, we gotta multiply 6 miles by 5 days. That's 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The answer is 30."
"So, Elise is writin' the alphabet a bunch of times. She writes it all out twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. Then she writes half of it, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters. After that, she writes all the letters she already wrote, so that's 52 letters again. 

So, we gotta add all those numbers together: 52 + 13 + 52 = 117 letters. I think that's right."
"So, there's this thing called a phone tree. It's like when someone calls a bunch of people, and then each of those people call a bunch of other people. It keeps goin' on like that. 

So, the first time, Ali calls 3 families. Then, those 3 families call 3 other families each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9. Then, those 9 families call 3 other families each, so that's 9 x 3 = 27. Then, those 27 families call 3 other families each, so that's 27 x 3 = 81.

So, in the fourth round, there's gonna be 81 families called."
"So, Mark was sick for a while and lost some weight. He lost 10 pounds every month. He weighs 70 pounds now. We need to figure out how much he weighed before he got sick.

Let's think about it... If he lost 10 pounds every month, that's like, a lot. So, if he lost 10 pounds for 3 months, that's 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. That's a lot of weight!

So, if he weighs 70 pounds now, we need to add the 30 pounds he lost to find out how much he weighed before he got sick. That would be 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

The answer is 100."
"So, there's this guy Jonathan and he's sad 'cause he don't have enough toys. He needs 2 more toys than the other guy James, who has 80 toys. We need to figure out how many toys Jonathan has.

We know that if James has 80 toys, and Jonathan needs 2 more, then Jonathan needs 80 + 2 = 82 toys. But that's not the answer we're lookin' for. We're lookin' for how many toys Jonathan already has. So, we gotta think about it like this: if Jonathan needs 2 more toys to make his set 5 times bigger than James's set, that means his set is 5 times 80, which is 400. And then we gotta subtract 2 from that, 'cause he already has some toys. So, 400 - 2 = 398.

So, Jonathan already has 398 toys.

**The answer is 398.**"
"So, there's this shop that sells school stuff. They got notebooks for $1.50 each, pens for $0.25 each, calculators for $12 each, and geometry sets for $10 each. This guy, Daniel, he wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the stuff.

First, let's add up the cost of all the stuff. 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 1 calculator is $12. And 1 geometry set is $10. So, the total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, we gotta give them a 10% discount. 10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3. So, the discount is $3. The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is $27."
"So Carly's buyin' stuff for her friends. She buys 5 hamburgers for $4 each, 10 packs of fries for $0.30 each, and 5 cans of fruit drinks for $2 each. 

First, let's add up the cost of the hamburgers: 5 * $4 = $20. Then, the cost of the fries: 10 * $0.30 = $3. And the cost of the fruit drinks: 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, let's add 'em all up: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33. Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

So Carly gets $17 back as change."
"So, there's this lady Antonella, and she sells stuff. She gets paid based on how much she sells. If she sells stuff worth $1000, she gets 30% of that. That's like, $300. But if she sells more than $1000, she gets 10% of the extra amount. So, if she sells $2500, that's $1500 more than $1000. She gets 10% of that, which is $150. So, she gets $300 + $150 = $450."
"So, Bill got 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. That's 2 x 24 = 48 bottles. He's got 70 guests comin' over, and he wants 2 bottles for each one. That's 70 x 2 = 140 bottles. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many more bottles he needs. We take the 140 bottles he needs and subtract the 48 bottles he already has. That's 140 - 48 = 92 bottles. 

So, Bill needs 92 more bottles of water."
"So, there's this guy Ray, and he swims in the water. When it's cold, he swims a mile in 16 minutes. When it's hot, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. 

So, when it's hot, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice 16 minutes. Twice 16 is 32, and 2 more than that is 34. So, he swims a mile in 34 minutes when it's hot.

Now, we need to figure out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles when it's hot. We multiply 3 by 34, which is 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles when it's hot than when it's cold, we subtract the time it takes when it's cold from the time it takes when it's hot. That's 102 - 48, which is 54 minutes.

The answer is 54."
"So, John gets paid $2 an hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. That's like, $2 * 5 * 4 = $40 a week. He wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it'll take him, we gotta divide $80 by $40. That's $80 ÷ $40 = 2. So, it'll take him 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: 2"
"So, you wanna know how much lunch is gonna cost. You pay $40 for a big fish sub, and then you pay three times that for a smaller one. That's like, three groups of $40. 

So, you do the math: $40 * 3 = $120. Then you add that to the $40 you already paid for the big one. That's $40 + $120 = $160.

The answer is: $160"
"So, there's this bag of buttons, right? And it's got 21 buttons in it. Now, some of these buttons got two holes and some got four holes. I think I counted 'em, and there's 7 buttons with two holes. That's 7 x 2 = 14 holes. 

The rest of the buttons, that's 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, they got four holes each. That's 14 x 4 = 56 holes. 

So, if we add 'em up, we get 14 + 56 = 70 holes. That's the total number of holes in all the buttons."
"So, we got this problem about lockers. There's this guy Timothy, and his locker is 24 cubic inches. Then there's Zack, and his locker is half as big as Timothy's. That means Zack's locker is 24 divided by 2, which is 12 cubic inches.

Now, we got Peter, and his locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. To find out how big Peter's locker is, we gotta divide Zack's locker size by 4. So, 12 divided by 4 is 3.

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"So, there's this lady named Octavia, and she drinks half the amount of coffee that's recommended. That means she drinks 0.5 cups. Her husband, Juan, drinks 10 times that amount, so he drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

Now, Juan's doctor told him to drink only 4 cups. To find out how much he needs to cut back, we gotta subtract 4 from 5. That's 5 - 4 = 1.

The answer is 1."
"So, there's this pet shop with 6 cages. 3 of 'em got hamsters and the other 3 got guinea pigs. We gotta count 'em all. 

First, let's count the hamsters. 3 cages got 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters. Then, we got 3 cages with guinea pigs, and each of those got 5 guinea pigs, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add 'em together: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents. So, the pet shop had 45 rodents."
"So, we got three friends, Mark, Susan, and Bob. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. That's right, 130.

Now, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds. That's a lot, right?

To find the average weight, we gotta add up all their weights and divide by 3. So, we add 150 + 130 + 260 = 540. Then we divide by 3, which is 540 / 3 = 180.

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"So, we got this thing about the pyramids and the sun. The pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and the sun is movin' up 5 degrees an hour. We wanna know how many degrees the sun is from the ground after 10 hours.

We take the 5 degrees the sun moves per hour and multiply it by 10 hours, which is 50 degrees. Then we add that to the 32 degrees the pyramids are from the ground. So, 50 + 32 is 82 degrees.

The answer is 82."
"So, James is buyin' birthday candles for his two sons. One's 12 years old and the other's 4 years younger. That means the younger one's 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old. That's a total of 4 candles. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how much James spends, we gotta divide 4 candles by 5 candles per pack. That's 4 ÷ 5 = 0.8. But James can't buy 0.8 packs, so he'll buy 1 pack.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"So, there's this lady named Judy. She reads a lot. 

She reads 15 minutes every night before bed. That's 7 nights a week. So, she reads for 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in a week. 

Now, she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in a week, we gotta divide 105 minutes by 1.5 minutes and then multiply by 2. 

105 / 1.5 = 70. Then, 70 * 2 = 140 pages. That's how many pages she reads in a week.

In the second week, she read 100 pages. To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add those two numbers together: 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"So, Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of 'em, and Trevor ate a quarter. I think a third is 4, and a quarter is 3. So, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many are left, I just subtract 7 from 12. That's 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"So, there's this guy Shiloh, and he's 44 years old today. Now, his nephew is gonna be three times as old as him in 7 years. We need to figure out how old the nephew is now.

Let's say the nephew's age is N. In 7 years, the nephew will be N + 7, and Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(N + 7).

Now, let's solve for N. First, we'll subtract 7 from both sides: 51 - 7 = 3N. That gives us 44 = 3N. Then, we'll divide both sides by 3: 44 ÷ 3 = N. That gives us N = 14.67. But since you can't be a fraction of a year old, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, the nephew is 14 years old.

The answer is 14."
"So, the tooth fairy gave Sharon some money for her teeth. She got $5 for the first one. Then she got $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 * $1 = $3. Then, for the last two teeth, she got half of what she got for the first three teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.

Now, let's add it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"So, there's this thing about three teenagers playin' soccer. Richie, he's the one who scored a lot of goals, 80 to be exact. He scored 20 more goals than this other guy, Mark. And he scored 45 more goals than this other guy, Anna.

So, we gotta figure out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. Let's start with Mark. If Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, that means Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Now, we know Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now that we know how many goals each of 'em scored, we can add 'em up to find the total. Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"So, there's this guy Liam and he's got a lemonade stand. He says he made $63. Then this other guy Mitchell comes along and he says he sold 21 lemonades for $4 each. We gotta figure out how much Mitchell made.

We multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. So, 21 * 4 is... um... 84. Yeah, that's right. Mitchell made $84.

Now, we gotta find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. We take the amount Mitchell made and subtract the amount Liam made. So, 84 minus 63 is... 21.

The answer is 21."
"So, Peter has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for a whole week. He buys wooden action figures for 3 days and plastic action figures for the rest of the week. The wooden action figures cost $5 each and the plastic ones cost $2 each.

First, let's see how much he spent on the wooden ones. He bought 3 of 'em, so that's $5 * 3 = $15. He had $70, so he's left with $70 - $15 = $55.

Now, he's gonna buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week. He's got $55 left, and each one costs $2. So, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27.5. But, he can't buy half a figure, so he'll buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter's got 3 wooden ones and 27 plastic ones. So, he's got 3 + 27 = 30 action figures.

The final answer is 30."
"So Leah got a new kitten and stuff. She spent $200 on spayin' it. Then she bought 3 vaccines for $20 each, so that's 3 * $20 = $60. And the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each, so that's 4 * $12 = $48.

To find out how much the kitten cost, we gotta add all that together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten cost $308."
"So, Ford has a garden and he grows roses. He gives some roses to the flower shops. The first shop gets 20 roses, the second shop gets 15 roses, and the third shop gets 30 roses. We need to figure out how many roses Ford doesn't have.

Let's see how many roses he gives away in a month. There are about 4 weeks in a month. So, we multiply the number of roses each shop gets per week by 4:

- The first shop gets 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- The second shop gets 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- The third shop gets 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Now, let's add up all the roses he gives away: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford doesn't have, we subtract the roses he grows from the roses he gives away: 260 - 160 = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses."
"So, Katina has $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to figure out how much money she has left after 2 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years is 2 x 12 = 24 months. If she takes out $100 every month, that's 24 x $100 = $2400. 

Now, we need to subtract $2400 from $3000. That's $3000 - $2400 = $600. 

The answer is $600."
"So, there's this food truck that only sells grilled cheese sandwiches. They buy bread for $3.00 a loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. They also spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

First, let's figure out how much money they make from selling the sandwiches. They sell 10 sandwiches, and each one is $7.00. So, they make 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

Now, let's see how much they spend. They need 1 loaf of bread, which is $3.00, and they also spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff. So, their total cost is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

To find out how much money they make, we subtract their total cost from their total revenue. That's $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The answer is: $37.00"
"So, Kate got 3 boxes of crayons, and they're all broke down into tiny pieces. She wants to make some kinda muffin thingies with 'em. She puts 'em in the oven for a bit, and then she sells 'em for $1.50 each.

First, we gotta figure out how many crayon pieces she got. She got 3 boxes, and each box has 64 crayons. So, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Now, she melts 8 crayon pieces together to make one muffin thingy. So, we gotta divide 192 by 8.

192 ÷ 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. She sells 'em for $1.50 each. To find out how much money she makes, we multiply 24 by $1.50.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"So, there's this guy Michael, and he's gettin' new carpet for his bedroom. The carpet costs $12 a square foot, plus $2 a square foot for the padding. His contractor's gonna charge him $4 a square foot to take out the old carpet, and $34 a square foot to put in the new one. The room's 18 feet by 12 feet, so we gotta figure out how much carpet they need.

First, we gotta find the area of the room. That's 18 times 12, which is 216 square feet. Now we know how much carpet they need.

The carpet costs $12 a square foot, so 216 square feet times $12 is $2592. That's the cost of the carpet.

The padding costs $2 a square foot, so 216 square feet times $2 is $432. That's the cost of the padding.

The contractor's gonna charge $4 a square foot to take out the old carpet, so 216 square feet times $4 is $864. That's the cost of the removal.

The contractor's also gonna charge $34 a square foot to put in the new carpet, so 216 square feet times $34 is $7344. That's the cost of the installation.

Now we add it all up: $2592 for the carpet, $432 for the padding, $864 for the removal, and $7344 for the installation. That's $9608 in total.

The final answer is: $9608"
"So, Mack wants to count birds. He saw 50 birds on the first two days, then 0 on the third day. Then he saw 120 birds on the fourth and fifth days, 20 birds on the sixth day, and 90 birds on the seventh day. 

To find out how many birds he saw on average, we gotta add up all the birds he saw and then divide by 7. 

Let's add 'em up: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280. 

Now, we divide by 7: 280 ÷ 7 = 40.

So, Mack saw 40 birds on average per day."
"So, there's this thing called a ""number train"" and it starts with 20. Then, we gotta do some stuff to it. 

First, we gotta add half of 20 to 20. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20 and get 30. Then, we divide 30 by 5, which is 6. 

Next, we take 6 and multiply it by the difference between 20 and 12. 20 minus 12 is 8, so we multiply 6 by 8 and get 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"So, there's this boy and his brother. The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. That means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we gotta add 'em together. 5 (the boy's cards) + 2 (the brother's cards) = 7.

The answer is 7."
"So, Maggie's oven is broken. It's supposed to be 450, but it's really 468. That's 18 degrees off. To find out how much it's off, we gotta divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100. That's like, 18 divided by 450 is 0.04, and then 0.04 times 100 is 4%. That means the oven is 4% off.

Now, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set it to. Her recipe says 520 degrees, but the oven is 4% off. So, we gotta add 4% of 520 to 520. 4% of 520 is 20.8, and 20.8 plus 520 is 540.8.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"So, Max is gonna watch two movies this weekend. The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. That's like, 90 minutes. The second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. That's like, 125 minutes. Now, we gotta add 'em together. 90 + 125 is 215. So, it's gonna take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: 215"
"So, Juan's neighbor Herb said he paid $76,000 for his house. Then, Juan asked how much his house was worth. Herb said it's 30% less than Herb's house. That means Juan's house is worth 70% of Herb's house.

To find out how much Juan's house is worth, we gotta calculate 70% of Herb's house. That's 0.7 x $76,000 = $53,200.

Now, we gotta add the values of both houses. That's $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"So, Judy got a bunch of cups, like, a dozen, which is 12. And she got twice as many dishes, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 dishes. 

Her friend came with 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 40 cups and 24 + 20, which is 44 dishes.

So, if we add all the cups and dishes together, we get 12 + 40 = 52 cups, and 24 + 44 = 68 dishes. 

So, the total number of cups and dishes is 52 + 68, which is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"So, there's this thing about contacts, right? They come in boxes, and each box has 90 of 'em. They last Pete 45 days. Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off. That means it's $100 - $10, which is $90. He's buyin' two boxes, so that's $90 x 2, which is $180. Now, we gotta figure out how much each pair costs. There's 90 pairs in two boxes, so we divide $180 by 90 pairs. That's $2 per pair.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, Tabitha paid John and Jill $10 an hour to clean out her attic and basement. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

Let's figure out how much each person made. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. She makes $10 an hour, so she made 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. He makes $10 an hour, so he made 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John made compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"So, there's this lady named Hannah. She does some stuff, like aerobics and running. Aerobics makes her burn a lot of calories, like 500 calories per hour. Running makes her burn even more, like 600 calories per hour. She does these things for a while, and I think she does it for 2 hours and 1 hour, respectively.

So, let's see how many calories she burns in total. For the aerobics, she burns 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. For running, she burns 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories. That's a total of 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, I think she needs water for every 200 calories. So, we gotta divide the total calories by 200. 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8. That means she needs 8 times 100 ml of water. 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"So there's this jar with jelly beans in it. It's got red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says that there's 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans is 4500. We need to figure out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (1% fewer), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (1% more). We can add these up to get the total number of jelly beans:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine the B's:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485

And the number of green jelly beans:

1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1509 - 1485 = 24

So, there are 24 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

The final answer is: 24"
"So Jared's typing speed is like, 47 words per minute at first. Then it goes up to 52 words per minute after he takes some typing lessons. And then it goes up some more, like 5 words, so it's 57 words per minute now.

To find the average, we gotta add all three numbers together and then divide by 3. So we do 47 + 52 + 57, which is 156. Then we divide that by 3, which is 52.

So the average of the three numbers is 52."
"So, there's this guy Martin, and he's thinkin' about what to eat for breakfast. If he eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds a week. If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week. We wanna know how much he'll weigh after 5 weeks.

If he eats Cheerios, he'll lose 1.25 pounds a week. That's 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds. So, he'll weigh 6.25 pounds less after 5 weeks.

If he eats donuts, he'll gain 1.75 pounds a week. That's 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds. So, he'll weigh 8.75 pounds more after 5 weeks.

The difference in weight is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"So, Alex is gettin' ready for this thing she's hostin', and she wants to make sure she's got enough seats. She invites 100 people via email, and they all say they're gonna bring 2 of their friends. Then she calls 10 of her friends and invites 'em too, and 8 of 'em say they're bringin' their spouses.

So, let's see... she invited 100 people, and they each brought 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 more people. Then she invited 10 friends, and 8 of 'em brought their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 100 (the ones she invited) + 200 (the friends) + 18 (the friends' spouses) = 318 people.

So, Alex needs 318 seats.

**The final answer is 318.**"
"So there's this line of dogs in a vet's office. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, and it weighs 10 pounds. The next dog is a Dachshund, and it weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so it's 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. Then there's a Papillon, and it weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it's 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The last dog is a Mastiff, and it weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon, so it's 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"So, there's this lady named Marilyn who wants to buy boots online. The boots cost $16 on Amazon, and shipping is $4. On eBay, the boots are $13, but shipping is twice as much as on Amazon. So, shipping on eBay is $4 x 2 = $8.

The total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20. The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we gotta subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay. That's $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"So, there's this beanstalk thingy. It starts out 4 feet tall, and it doubles in height every day. We need to figure out how many days it takes for it to be taller than the window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's see what happens:

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than 20 feet.
Day 2: It doubles to 8 feet, still less than 20 feet.
Day 3: It doubles again to 16 feet, still less than 20 feet.
Day 4: It doubles once more to 32 feet, and now it's more than 20 feet.

So, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than the window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, there's this thing about mushrooms, right? They're like, 100 grams or somethin', and they got 3 grams of protein in 'em. Now, this fella John, he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. We need to figure out how much protein he gets from that.

First, we gotta see how many of those 100-gram mushrooms he eats. So, we divide 200 by 100, and that's... um... 2. So, he eats 2 of those mushroom cups a day.

Now, each cup got 3 grams of protein, so we multiply 2 cups by 3 grams, and that's... 6 grams of protein a day. 

Now, we need to figure out how many days in a week, and that's 7. So, we multiply 6 grams by 7, and that's... 42 grams of protein a week.

The final answer is 42."
"So, Jerry's age is like, twice what it was 5 years ago, right? That means if we take his age 5 years ago, and we multiply it by 2, we get his age now. 

Let's say his age 5 years ago was x. Then, his age now is 2x. But we know that 2x is also equal to his age now, so we can set up an equation: 2x = x + 5. 

Solving for x, we get x = 5. So Jerry's age now is 2x, which is 10. 

Now, we need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years. We add 3 to his age now, which is 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"So, George needs to pay for some dental work. He's gotta get 2 implants, and each one costs $2000. He also wants a crown on one of 'em, and that's an extra $500. He already gave some money down, $600. He makes $15 an hour at his job.

First, we gotta figure out how much he needs to pay in total. The implants are $2000 each, so 2 of 'em is 2 x $2000 = $4000. Then, he wants a crown on one, so that's another $500. That's a total of $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He already gave $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours he needs to work to make that much money. He makes $15 an hour, so we divide $3900 by $15. That's $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"So, we got this thing about a triangle and angles, right? One angle is twice the smallest, and one angle is three times the smallest. We gotta figure out the biggest angle.

Let's say the smallest angle is x. Then the other two angles are 2x and 3x. We know that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. So we gotta solve for x.

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the x's: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30, we can find the other two angles. 2x is 2(30) = 60, and 3x is 3(30) = 90.

So, the angles are 30, 60, and 90. The biggest angle is 90.

The answer is 90."
"So, Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies. 

First, let's see how much money he has. He has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2. He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60. He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70. And he has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45. 

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"So, there's this pet store with dogs, cats, and birds. I think I counted 'em. Dogs got 4 legs, and there's 5 of 'em, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 legs. Cats got 4 legs too, and there's 2 of 'em, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 legs. And birds got 2 legs, and there's 10 of 'em, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The answer is 48."
"So, Jamaal was liftin' an 8-pound weight. Then he went and got a heavier one, but it was too much for him. He got a weight that's 2 pounds lighter than the one he got. 

To find out how much weight he got, we gotta do some math. First, we gotta find 50% of 8 pounds. That's like, half of 8. So, 8 * 0.5 = 4. Then we add that to 8, so 8 + 4 = 12. That's how much heavier he got. 

But then he got a weight that's 2 pounds lighter than that. So we gotta subtract 2 from 12. That's 12 - 2 = 10. 

So, Jamaal is liftin' 10 pounds now.

The final answer is 10."
"So, Steve gets some games for his birthday and some more games throughout the year. He gets 5 games for his birthday every year. Then, he buys 1 game a month for a year, and then 2 games a month for the next year, and 4 games a month for the last year. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.

Let's count the games he gets each year:

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game a month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 + 12 = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game a month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 + 12 = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games a month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 + 24 = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add up all the games he has after 3 years: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"So, we got a plane that goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That's like, a pretty fast plane, right? To figure out how long it takes to go 2000 miles, we gotta do some math.

We need to find out how many miles the plane can go in one hour. We do that by dividing 1200 miles by 3 hours. That's 400 miles per hour. Now we know that.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to go 2000 miles at that speed. We do that by dividing 2000 miles by 400 miles per hour. That's 5 hours.

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to go 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, there's this guy Ruiz, and he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. That's like, a lot of chocolates. Now, there's this other lady, Marissa, and she makes 3/4 as many chocolates as Ruiz makes in 1 hour. That's like, 3/4 of 120, which is 90 pounds. So, she makes 90 pounds in 1 hour.

If they work together for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds.

Together, they make 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds of chocolates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"So, there's this guy Howard, and he spends some money at the arcade. He spends $8 on Monday. Then, he spends twice as much on Tuesday, which is 2 x $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64.

So, let's add up how much he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88. He started with $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract $88 from $100.

$100 - $88 = $12

The final answer is 12."
"So, Patrick sold lemonade for a while. He sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours, and then 10 cups per hour for 2 hours. He charged 50 cents per cup. 

First, let's figure out how much he made in the first 4 hours. He sold 15 cups per hour, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 cups. He charged 50 cents per cup, so that's 60 * 0.50 = $30.

Then, he sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours. That's 10 * 2 = 20 cups. He charged 60 cents per cup, so that's 20 * 0.60 = $12.

Now, let's add those two amounts together. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"So, there's this thing about tires. They rotate a lot when you drive. Like, every 2 miles, they do 725 times. And this guy Jeremy, he drives 400 miles a month. We need to figure out how long it takes for his tires to wear out.

First, we gotta see how many miles he drives in a year. That's easy, just multiply 400 by 12.

400 * 12 = 4800 miles

Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles.

4800 / 2 = 2400

So, the tires rotate 2400 times a year. Now, we gotta see how many times the tires can rotate before they wear out. That's 10,440,000.

2400 * 4362.5 = 10,440,000

 Wait, that's not right. I made a mistake. Let me try again.

2400 * 4362.5 = 10,440,000

I did it! The tires will last 4362.5 years.

Final answer: 4362.5"
"So, there's this shampoo bottle that costs $24.00. It says you need 2 pumps to get 120 washings. If you use 1 pump, how much will it cost per pump?

Let's think about it... If 2 pumps give 120 washings, then 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. That's like, half the washings.

Now, we gotta figure out how much it costs for 60 washings. The whole bottle costs $24.00, so for 60 washings, it's $24.00 / 2 = $12.00.

We need to know how much it costs per pump, so we gotta convert that to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $12.00 is 12 * 100 = 1200 cents.

Now, we divide 1200 cents by 60 washings to get the cost per pump. That's 1200 / 60 = 20 cents.

The final answer is 20."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There's a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. 

To find out how much Joe will have left, we gotta calculate the discount on the shirt first. That's $25 * 0.3 = $7.50. So the shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 now.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50. 

Now, we gotta add sales tax. I think sales tax is like, 8% or something. So, $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20. The total cost is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Joe started with $50, so he'll have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left. That's not good, he's gonna be in the red.

The final answer is: -$6.70"
"So, Juan wanna make a lot of croissants, huh? He wanna make 4 dozen a day for a whole week. That's a lotta flaky pastry!

So, let's figure out how much butter he needs. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. If he makes 4 dozen a day, that's 4 times the butter. So, he needs 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound of butter a day.

Now, he's gonna make that for 7 days. So, we multiply 1 pound by 7. That's 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter.

So, Juan needs 7 pounds of butter to make all those croissants.

The answer is: 7"
"So, there's this thing about costin' to repave a street. It's like, $194 per meter, and Monica's street is 150 meters long. We gotta figure out how much it costs her.

So, we multiply $194 by 150, and that's... um... *counts on fingers* ...$29,100. That's how much it costs Monica.

Now, there's this other guy, Lewis. His street is 490 meters long. We gotta figure out how much it costs him. We multiply $194 by 490, and that's... *counts on fingers again* ...$95,060. That's how much it costs Lewis.

So, we gotta find out how much more it costs Lewis than Monica. We take $95,060 and subtract $29,100, and that's... *thinks for a moment* ...$65,960. That's how much more it costs Lewis.

The answer is: $65,960"
"So, John got some money to do some research. He had $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

Then, the money went up by 50% every month. So, the 6th month he got $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000. The 7th month he got $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000. The 8th month he got $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500. The 9th month he got $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250. The 10th month he got $506,250 * 1.5 = $757,500.

Now, we add all the money together: $500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $2,380,000."
"So, there's this basketball team and they went to a steakhouse. The first guy ate a steak that's 6 ounces. The second guy ate some beef tips, and there's 8 of 'em, and each one's 1 ounce. The third guy ate a big ol' steak that's 1 pound, which is 16 ounces. The other two guys didn't eat no meat.

So, let's add up the ounces of meat they ate. We got 6 (first guy) + 8 (second guy) + 16 (third guy) = 30 ounces.

The answer is 30."
"So, there's this Reddit group with 1000 members. They post stuff on it. Each member posts 3 times a day. We need to figure out how many posts they'll have in March. March has 31 days, right?

So, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March. That's 3 * 31. 

3 * 31 = 93

So, the group will have 93 posts in March."
"So, Gary does laundry twice a week. He uses 20 gallons of water for each load. I'm not really sure how many weeks are in a year, but I think it's like, a lot. Let's just say 52 weeks.

If he does laundry 52 weeks a year, and he does it twice a week, that's 52 * 2 = 104 loads. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so that's 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

Now, I think a gallon of water costs 15 cents. I'm pretty sure that's right. So, 2080 gallons of water would cost 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"So, Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then she went to the pet store and bought some stuff. She got 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. She also got 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. Then she bought 20 fish for $0.50 each, which is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. And she needed some fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

The answer is: $33.00"
"So, there's this beanstalk thingy in Jane's backyard. It's 3 inches tall after the first week. Then it doubles in height, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 inches after the second week. Then it grows another 4 inches, so that's 6 + 4 = 10 inches after the third week.

The beanstalk is 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"So, there's this fella Prince, and he's a butcher. He sells a lot of meat, like 15 kilograms every hour. He works for 10 hours a day, so that's 15 * 10 = 150 kilograms of meat per day. 

Now, he got a big bull that weighs 750 kilograms. We need to figure out how many days it'll take him to sell all that meat. To do that, we gotta divide the weight of the bull by how much meat he sells in a day. That's 750 kilograms divided by 150 kilograms per day.

750 ÷ 150 = 5

So, it'll take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from the bull."
"So, there's this school auditorium with 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. That's a total of 4 * 18 = 72 seats.

Now, one-fourth of those seats are taken by the administrators. That's 72 / 4 = 18 seats taken by the administrators.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats. Then, one-third of those are taken by the parents, which is 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

So, the rest of the seats are taken by the students. That's 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

The answer is 36."
"So, we got 6 poles at each intersection, and each pole has 4 street lights. That's 6 * 4 = 24 street lights. But, 20 of 'em ain't workin'. So, we gotta subtract those. 24 - 20 = 4. That's the number of street lights that are workin'."
"So, we got two DVDs, right? One's been played a lot, like, 356 times, and the other one's been played not as much, like, 135 times. We need to figure out how many times we can play 'em before they break.

Let's see... if one DVD can be played 1000 times and it's been played 356 times, that means it's got 1000 - 356 = 644 times left. And the other one's been played 135 times, so it's got 1000 - 135 = 865 times left.

Now, let's add 'em together: 644 + 865 = 1509. So, we can play both DVDs 1509 times before they break.

The final answer is: 1509"
"So, John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, and each time he stayed for 2 hours. That's a total of 2 sessions a week, and he did that for 6 weeks. So, he went 2 * 6 = 12 times.

He stayed for 2 hours each time, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 hours. Now, he paid $125 for each hour. So, the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"So, Jim has 20 pieces of gum. He chews gum for 8 hours at school, and he chews 1 piece every 2 hours. That's 8 / 2 = 4 pieces. Then he chews 2 more pieces, one on the way home and one after dinner. So, he chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces in total.

He starts with 20 pieces, and after chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left. Then he gives half of that to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces. So, he gives away 7 pieces and has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

The answer is 7."
"So, some lady's gonna be 16 in 12 years. That means she's 4 now. If she's 4 now, then 4 years from now she'll be 8."
"So, there's this baseball coach and a basketball coach, and they went shopping together. The baseball coach bought some baseballs for $3 each, and the basketball coach bought some basketballs for $14 each. I counted the baseballs and found out the baseball coach bought 9 of 'em. I counted the basketballs and found out the basketball coach bought 8 of 'em.

So, I did some math, and the baseball coach spent 9 x $3 = $27. The basketball coach spent 8 x $14 = $112. Now, I gotta find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. I did that by subtractin' the two amounts: $112 - $27 = $85.

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"So, there's this lady named Arianna, and she's got a garden with 10 rows of flowers. Each row has 20 flowers. Now, she's got 4/5 of the flowers blooming. To figure out how many flowers are blooming, we gotta multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row, and then multiply that by 4/5.

So, 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers. Then, 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers. That's how many flowers are blooming in Arianna's garden.

The final answer is: 160"
"So, Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. We gotta convert that to megabytes per second first. There's 1000 kb in 1 megabyte, so we divide 20 by 1000. That's 0.02 megabytes per second.

Now, we need to figure out how many seconds are in an hour. There's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, we multiply 0.02 megabytes per second by 60 seconds per minute, and then by 60 minutes per hour. That's 0.02 x 60 x 60 = 72 megabytes per hour.

So, Ashley's internet speed is 72 megabytes per hour."
"So, there's this tow truck that pulled cars for a whole week. It pulled 10 cars for the first three days, and then it pulled 6 cars for the rest of the week. I counted the days, and there's 7 days in a week.

For the first three days, it pulled 10 cars each day. So, that's 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

For the rest of the week, it pulled 6 cars each day. There's 4 days left, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

Now, I add those two numbers together: 30 + 24 = 54 cars.

The final answer is 54."
"So, there's this kid Adam and he wants to ride a big roller coaster. The thing is, you gotta be 4 feet tall to ride it, and he's only 40 inches tall right now. He grows 2 inches every year. 

To figure out how many years it'll take him to be tall enough, we gotta subtract his height from the height the roller coaster needs. That's 4 feet, which is 48 inches. So, 48 - 40 = 8 inches. 

Now, we gotta divide that by how much he grows each year, which is 2 inches. So, 8 / 2 = 4. That means it'll take him 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The answer is 4."
"So, James got a job sellin' used cars. He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. The company paid 30% of that price to buy the cars. That's like, 0.3 times $25,000, which is $7,500. They paid $7,500 for each car.

So, the total they paid is 10 x $7,500 = $75,000. Now, James gets to keep the rest, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 times $175,000, which is $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"So, there's this lady Tiffany, and she's tryin' to figure out how many surfers can stay on a big wave. She says that when the wave is over 30 feet, only 25% of the riders can stay up. And out of those riders, 60% are women. There's 100 riders in total.

First, we gotta find out how many riders can stay up. We do that by takin' 25% of 100, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...25! Yeah, 25 riders can stay up.

Now, we gotta find out how many of those women are stayin' up. We take 60% of 25, which is... *thinks for a sec* ...10! So, 10 women are stayin' up.

That means the rest of the riders who can stay up are men. We subtract the women from the total, so... 25 - 10 = 15. So, 15 men can stay up on the wave.

The final answer is 15."
"So, there's this jeweler store and they got these three kinds of jewels: diamond, gold, and silver. The price of the gold one is 4/5 times the price of the diamond one. And the silver one is $400 cheaper than the gold one.

The diamond one costs $2000. So, we gotta figure out how much the gold one costs. We do that by multiplying the diamond one's price by 4/5. That's like, 4 divided by 5, then multiplied by 2000. That's 0.8 times 2000, which is 1600.

Now, the silver one is $400 cheaper than the gold one. So, we subtract 400 from 1600. That's 1600 minus 400, which is 1200.

We got the prices of all three now: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add 'em all together. That's 2000 plus 1600 plus 1200, which is 4800.

The final answer is: $4800"
"So, Max bought some stamps. He got 16 of 'em with snowflakes on 'em. Then he got 3 more truck stamps than snowflakes, so he got 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 16 (snowflakes) + 19 (trucks) + 10 (roses) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"So, Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and Tom is driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. We gotta figure out how long it's gonna take Tom to catch up to Bob.

First, we gotta find out how fast Tom is closin' the gap. We do that by subtractin' Tom's speed from Bob's speed. That's 70 - 55, which is 15 miles per hour.

Now, we gotta divide the distance by the speed. That's 75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour. That's 5 hours.

So, it's gonna take Tom 5 hours to catch up to Bob.

The answer is 5."
"So, there's this guy Tommy and he caught some fish. And there's this other guy Darren, and he caught some fish too. And then there's Naomi, and she caught a lot of fish. 

Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. So, we gotta subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught. That's 17 - 6 = 11.

Now, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we gotta add 3 to 11. That's 11 + 3 = 14.

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"So, Manny's parents said they won't let him do karate if it costs more than $10 per class. They already paid $60 for 10 classes. To find out how many classes he can miss, we gotta divide the money they paid by the price per class.

$60 ÷ $10 = 6

That means they can afford 6 classes. Manny already did 10, so he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

The final answer is 4."
"So, there's this lady Julie and her coworker Jewel. Jewel does 50 customers a day, and Julie does twice as many, so Julie does 100 customers a day. 

To find out how many customers they do in a week, we gotta add 'em together: 50 + 100 = 150. Then we multiply that by 7, 'cause they work 7 days a week. 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"So, there's this thing about three people runnin' together. Paisley ran 4 miles. Then there's Reggie, and he ran 5 times what Paisley did, which is 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Now, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 miles. That's 17 miles.

Next, I gotta find out how much 5 oranges cost. I do that by multiplying 5 by $3.30, which is... *counts on fingers again* ...$16.50! That's how much 5 oranges cost.

Now, I add 'em together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50! That's the total cost.

The final answer is: $42.50"
"So, Bob wants to dig a hole. He wants it to be 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. I think he's gonna need a lot of shovels. 

To find out how long it'll take him, we gotta multiply the length, width, and depth. That's like, 6 times 4 times 3. That's 72. 

Now, it takes him 3 seconds to shovel one little cube of dirt. So, we gotta multiply 72 by 3. That's 216. 

So, it's gonna take Bob 216 seconds to dig that hole. That's like, 3.6 minutes."
"So, Bill is gettin' a new truck. He's gettin' a big one with some extra stuff. The base price of the truck is $30,000. Then he's addin' some extras. The king cab is $7,500 more. Leather seats are one-third of that, so they're $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they're $2,000. And the light package is $1,500.

Let's add it all up: $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500. Then $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000. Next, $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000. Finally, $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"So, Tim gets a promotion and stuff. He gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary. That's like, $1,000 more. And he also gets a bonus, which is half a month's salary, so that's $10,000. 

So, his new salary is $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000. To find out how much he makes in a year, we gotta multiply that by 12. That's $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"So, James buys a new wardrobe. He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit. The suits cost $750 each and the dress pants cost 1/5 that cost. The dress shirts were $60 each. 

First, let's figure out how much the suits cost. He buys 10 suits, and each one is $750. So, 10 * $750 = $7500. 

Next, we gotta figure out how much the dress pants cost. The dress pants cost 1/5 of what the suits cost. So, 1/5 of $750 is $150. He buys 10 pants, so 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's figure out how much the dress shirts cost. He buys 3 shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. Each shirt is $60, so 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The total cost of everything is $10800."
"So, there's this news website that publishes a lot of articles, like, 20 of 'em every day. And then there's this other website, its sister website, that publishes, like, 10 articles a day. We need to figure out how many articles they publish in February, which has 28 days.

So, we multiply the number of articles the first website publishes by the number of days in February, and we get 20 * 28 = 560 articles. Then we do the same for the second website, 10 * 28 = 280 articles. Now we add 'em together, 560 + 280 = 840 articles.

The answer is 840."
"So, there's this guy Steve, he's 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she's 60 + 4 = 64 years old. Now, their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"So, we got a bag of flour, and it's divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. We need to know how much flour is in three bags. 

To find out, we gotta multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. So, we do 8 portions * 3 bags = 24 portions. 

Now, we know each portion is 2 kilograms, so we multiply 24 portions by 2 kilograms. That's 24 * 2 = 48 kilograms.

The answer is 48."
"So, Alisa and Stanley went bikin' and stuff. Alisa went 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. That's like, 12 x 4.5, which is 54 miles. Then Stanley went 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. That's like, 10 x 2.5, which is 25 miles. Now, we gotta add 'em together. 54 + 25 is 79. So, they biked a total of 79 miles.

The final answer is 79."
"So Bill is tryin' to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet per hour through dirt, and half that fast through clay. He's gotta dig through 24 feet of dirt and 8 feet of clay. 

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to dig through the dirt. That's 24 feet, and he can do 4 feet per hour. So, that's 24 / 4 = 6 hours. 

Now, he's gotta dig through clay, and that's half as fast, so that's 4 feet per hour. He's gotta dig 8 feet, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 hours. 

So, in total, it's gonna take him 6 hours to dig through the dirt and 2 hours to dig through the clay. That's 6 + 2 = 8 hours. 

The final answer is: 8"
"So, this guy Howie wants to get cupcakes for his whole class. He's thinkin' about gettin' one of each kinda cupcake, so he's gonna get vanilla and chocolate. He's gonna get 2 of each for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. 

First, let's figure out how many he needs for himself and his teacher. That's 2 + 2 = 4 cupcakes. Then, he's gotta get 2 for each of his 25 classmates, so that's 25 x 2 = 50 cupcakes. 

Now, add 'em all up: 4 (for himself and his teacher) + 50 (for the classmates) = 54 cupcakes. So, Howie should get 54 cupcakes."
"So, Fishio posted a selfie on Instagram and got 2000 likes after a week. Then, three weeks later, she got 70 times as many likes as the first time. That means she got 70 x 2000 = 140000 likes.

Then, she got 20000 more likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we need to add the new likes to the old likes.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000
Total likes = 160000

The final answer is 160000."
"So, there's this lady named Clara, and she bought 20 pomegranates on Tuesday. The price was $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost was $20 * 20 = $400. Then, she got $2 off, so it's $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, there's this lady named Sheila, and she bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store gave her a 10% discount. First, we gotta find 10% of $30. That's $30 * 0.10 = $3. Then, we subtract that from $30, so $30 - $3 = $27. Now, we multiply that by 20, so $27 * 20 = $540.

The difference between the two prices is $398 - $540. That's a negative number, which means the price on Tuesday was more expensive."
"So, Ariadne has a shop with two kinds of hats, red and green. She sold a lot of red hats in the first month, and it's said that the money from those red hats was half the money she made from green hats. If the red hats made $400, then the green hats made twice that, which is $800.

So, the first month's total was $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, she sold 3/4 of the first month's total. That's 3/4 of $1200, which is $900.

To find the total for both months, we add $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"So, James rents a horse-drawn carriage for 4 hours, but he gets 1 hour free. That means he pays for 3 hours. The first hour costs $15, and the other 2 hours cost twice as much, which is $30. 

So, the total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"So Sally's bank account was $200 at the start of the week and now it's $420. That means she got some money taken out of her paycheck. We need to figure out how much.

Let's see... if she had $200 and now she has $420, that's a difference of $220. But we know she's supposed to get $300. So, to find out how much was taken out, we need to subtract $220 from $300.

$300 - $220 = $80

So, $80 was taken out of her paycheck."
"So, there's this lady Lori, and she's havin' a party. She needs eggs for deviled eggs, and she's got 16 guests comin' over. Each guest is gonna eat 3 deviled egg halves. So, we gotta figure out how many eggs she needs.

First, we gotta multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest is gonna eat. That's 16 * 3 = 48. Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause it takes 2 halves to make one egg. So, 48 / 2 = 24.

Now, we gotta figure out how many dozens that is. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we gotta divide 24 by 12. That's 24 / 12 = 2.

So, Lori needs 2 dozen eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Shiela gotta write a 15-page paper, but she already done 1/3 of it. That means she done 5 pages. Now, we gotta find out how many pages she got left.

Let's see... if she done 5 pages outta 15, that means she got 15 - 5 = 10 pages left. So, she gotta write 10 more pages.

The answer is 10."
"So, Mike's teacher gave him a 200-page book to read in 30 days. He wants to read 10 pages a day. We need to figure out how many days it'll take him to finish the book.

Let's do the math: 200 pages / 10 pages a day = 20 days. That's how many days it'll take Mike to finish the book.

Now, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he'll finish. He has 30 days to finish, so we subtract 20 from 30. That's 30 - 20 = 10.

So, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"So, James buys a plane that costs $150,000. He pays $5000 a month to keep it in a hanger. He also spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger. That means he spends $5000 + $5000 x 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

To find out how much he spends in a year, we gotta multiply the monthly costs by 12. So, $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. Then, $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

So, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (first year's costs) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"So, Finley went to the store and bought some stuff. She had rice, beans, and pork. It took her 30 minutes to cook the rice. It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The beans took half the time of the pork and rice together. So, we gotta add the time for pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Then we divide that by 2, and that's 80 / 2 = 40 minutes for the beans.

Now, we add up the time for all the food: 30 minutes for the rice, 50 minutes for the pork, and 40 minutes for the beans. That's 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is 120."
"So, we got two mixtures here. One's got half a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts, and the other's got one fifth of a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts. 

First, let's figure out how much the first one costs. Half a pound of almonds is $10, and a third of a pound of walnuts is $5. So, the first one's $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, for the second one, one fifth of a pound of almonds is $2, and a third of a pound of walnuts is $5. So, the second one's $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we gotta find out how much more the first one costs than the second one. That's $15 - $7 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, there's this fella named Lee, and he's got a farm with sheep and geese. He's got a total of 70 legs and 20 heads. Now, sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We need to figure out how many sheep he's got.

Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs, so 4s legs come from the sheep. Geese have 2 legs, so 2g legs come from the geese. The total number of legs is 70, so 4s + 2g = 70.

We also know that sheep and geese both have heads, so the total number of heads is 20. That means s + g = 20.

Now, we can solve these two equations. If we take the second equation and subtract 's' from both sides, we get g = 20 - s.

We can plug this into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70. Simplify it, and we get 4s + 40 - 2s = 70. This simplifies to 2s + 40 = 70. Then, we subtract 40 from both sides, and we get 2s = 30. Finally, we divide both sides by 2, and we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Roger went to the store to buy some coffee. He likes a certain kind, but it was sold out. He had to buy a different kind that's more expensive. This new kind costs $6 a pound. He needs a week's worth of coffee, and he drinks one pound a day. That's 7 pounds. He also bought a donut for $2.

To find out how much everything cost, we gotta add the cost of the coffee and the donut. The coffee costs 7 pounds * $6 a pound, which is $42. Then we add the $2 donut. So, $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"I'm tryin' to figure out how much that apple pie cost. Gus spent a bunch of money at the store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8, and a bottle of soda for $1. I'm gonna add up the other stuff first.

The chips cost $4, and the chicken and soda cost $9. So, that's $4 + $9 = $13. Now, I'm subtractin' that from the total Gus spent, which is $20.

$20 - $13 = $7

So, the apple pie cost $7."
"So, James delivers newspapers, right? He gives some to District A, some to District B, and some to District C. He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. We need to figure out how many he gives to District B.

Let's see... if he gives 600 in total, and 198 to District A and 209 to District C, that's 198 + 209 = 407. So, the rest must be for District B. 

That means he gives 600 - 407 = 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: 193"
"So, John's takin' a cookin' class, right? He's goin' to class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. That's a lotta cookin'! He's doin' it for 6 whole weeks. That's a lot of cookin' time.

So, let's figure out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time. We gotta add up all the hours he spends in class, then divide that by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

He's in class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours a week. He does that for 6 weeks, so that's 8 x 6 = 48 hours. Now, we gotta divide that by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 ÷ 1.5 = 32

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"So, we got 150 teachers on the court, and 60% of 'em are history teachers. That means the rest are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we gotta subtract the number of history teachers from the total.

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. So, there's 90 history teachers. Now, we subtract that from 150 to get the number of math teachers: 150 - 90 = 60.

Now, we know there's 60 math teachers, and each one sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how much time they all sleep in one day, we multiply 60 by 6: 60 * 6 = 360.

The answer is 360."
"So, there's this lady named Aurelia, and she's got $120. Then there's this other lady named Kassidy, and she's got 3/4 of what Aurelia's got. That's 3/4 * 120 = 90. 

Now, there's this other lady named Rayna, and she's got 60 more than Kassidy. That's 90 + 60 = 150.

So, let's add up all their money: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

If they wanna share it equally, we gotta divide it by 3. That's 360 / 3 = 120.

So, each of 'em would have 120 dollars.

Final answer: 120"
"So, there's this lady Sarah and she's playin' basketball. The game's divided into 4 parts, and each part is 12 minutes long. But, there's this one part where it's tied, so they gotta add a little extra time. That extra time is 5 minutes.

So, we gotta add 5 minutes to the 4 parts. That's 4 x 12 = 48 minutes. Then we add 5 minutes. 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The answer is 53 minutes."
"So, we got a company with 50 employees. We need to find out how many of 'em are in charge. First, we gotta find out how many of 'em are in charge of the whole company. We know that 20% of the employees are in charge, and that's 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is 10. Now, we gotta find 30% of those 10. That's 30% of 10, which is 3. So, there's 3 people in charge of the whole company."
"So, we gotta figure out how much stuff Svetlana needs for 16 muffins. She needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt for one muffin. 

First, we do the flour: 5 tablespoons * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons. Then we do the sugar: 3 tablespoons * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons. And for the salt: 0.25 tablespoons * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons.

Now we add 'em all up: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons. That's how much stuff Svetlana needs.

The final answer is: 132"
"So, there's this guy Robert, and he had 3 pounds of candy. Then there's Cindy, and she had 5 pounds. And there's Aaron, and he had 4 pounds. They wanna share it all together. So, we gotta add 'em up: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds. Now, they wanna split it evenly among the three of 'em. So, we divide 12 by 3, and that's 4. They each get 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is 4."
"So, Adam went to a store and bought some candies. He got 7 of one kind and 10 of another kind. One of the first kind costs 50 cents, and one of the second kind costs 75 cents. He paid the cashier 15 dollars. 

To find out how much change he got, we gotta add up the cost of all the candies. The first kind costs 7 x 50 cents, which is 350 cents. The second kind costs 10 x 75 cents, which is 750 cents. We need to add those together: 350 + 750 = 1100 cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide 1100 by 100 to get 11 dollars. 

Adam paid 15 dollars, so we subtract 11 dollars from 15 dollars to find the change: 15 - 11 = 4 dollars.

The final answer is: $4"
"So, Christina's got a calendar and she writes down how she's feelin' every day. She's had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest are neutral. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the last 8 days were neutral. Then, the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good again.

Let's see... if the first 8 days were good, that's 8. Then the next 8 days were bad, that's 8. And the last 8 days were neutral, that's 8. So, we got 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days accounted for. That leaves 30 - 24 = 6 days. But wait, we gotta add the next 3 good days, so that's 6 + 3 = 9.

So, Christina's got 9 good days left in the month.

Final answer: 9"
"So, Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We need to figure out how many books Sally has. Let's think about it... If Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, that means Sally's books are like, half of Janey's books minus 3. 

So, if we take Janey's books, which is 21, and we divide it by 2, we get 10.5. Then, we subtract 3 from that, and we get 7.5. But, you can't have half a book, so we round down to 7. That's how many books Sally has.

The answer is 7."
"So, there's this bamboo in Mrs. Jameson's backyard. It grows super fast, like 30 inches a day. Right now, it's 20 feet tall. We need to figure out how many days it'll take for it to be 600 inches tall.

First, we gotta convert 20 feet into inches. There's 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is 20 x 12 = 240 inches. Now we got our starting point.

We need to find out how many days it'll take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. We do that by subtracting 240 from 600, which is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Now, we gotta divide 360 by 30, which is how many inches the bamboo grows each day. 360 ÷ 30 = 12.

So, it'll take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

The answer is 12."
"So, James has some toys for his dog shelter. He got 4 toys for 4 dogs, but then there were more dogs. He bought more toys, and then some dogs left. Now, he needs to know how many toys he needs.

Let's start with the dogs. James had 4 dogs, and then there were 8 more. So, he had 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Then, he bought more toys, and when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as before. That means he had 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. But then, 3 dogs left, so he had 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Each dog needs a toy, so James needs 21 toys."
"So, there's this thing about three people investin' money in a joint savings account. They put in $1200 together. Then, one of 'em, Dylan, puts in 2/5 of that. That's like, 2/5 of 1200, which is 480. 

Now, we gotta find out how much money is left. We take 1200 and subtract 480, which is 720. That's the amount left.

Next, this other person, Frances, puts in 2/3 of that 720. That's 2/3 of 720, which is 480. 

Now, we gotta find out how much the last person, Skyler, put in. We take 720 and subtract 480, which is 240. That's how much Skyler put in.

The final answer is 240."
"So, there's these two sisters, Carol and Jennifer. They like gettin' signatures from famous people. They got a book for that. 

Carol got 20 signatures, and Jennifer got 44. They wanna get to 100 signatures. They got 64 signatures now. To get to 100, they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures."
"So, there's this lady Lorie, she gets paid $10 an hour. And there's this other lady Karen, she gets paid twice as much as Lorie. So, Karen gets paid $20 an hour.

Now, we wanna know how much Karen makes in two days if she works 3 hours a day. To do that, we gotta multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day, then multiply that by 2.

So, $20 an hour * 3 hours a day = $60 a day. Then, $60 a day * 2 days = $120.

The answer is $120."
"So, we got 6 potatoes makin' 36 hash browns. That's like, 6 groups of 6. If we got 96 potatoes, we just gotta divide 'em up into groups of 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, we can make 16 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

**Answer: 16**"
"So, we got a elevator that can hold 700 kg. There's this guy Jack and 8 other grown-ups, and they all wanna ride the elevator together. We need to figure out how much they're gonna weigh in total.

Each grown-up weighs 80 kg. So, we multiply 80 by 9 (that's Jack and the 8 other grown-ups) to get the total weight.

That's 720 kg. Now, we need to see how much that is over the limit. We take 720 and subtract 700.

That's 20 kg. So, they're gonna be 20 kg over the limit."
"So, there's this lady named Katarina, and she's got 68 cookies. She's got 5 less cookies than this fella Max. So, we gotta add 5 to 68 to find out how many cookies Max has. That's 68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.

Now, Max has 12 more cookies than this big, furry guy, the Cookie Monster. So, we gotta subtract 12 from 73 to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. That's 73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

This other lady, Summer, she's got 23 more cookies than Max. So, we add 23 to 73 to find out how many cookies Summer has. That's 73 + 23 = 96 cookies for Summer.

Now, let's add up all their cookies: Katarina's 68, Max's 73, the Cookie Monster's 61, and Summer's 96. That's 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"So, Shania's makin' her own dress and she's gonna make it longer. She's gonna add 50% of the original length to it, and then she's gonna add 20cm to the bottom. The final dress is 140cm long. 

Let's figure out the original length. We'll call that x. If she adds 50% of x to it, that's like addin' 0.5x to it. So, the new length is x + 0.5x, which is 1.5x. Then, she adds 20cm to it. The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"So, there's this fella named Chris, and he's got a lawn mower that's got two speeds. One speed is super slow, and the other is super fast. He can mow his whole lawn in 1 hour with the slow speed, or 40 minutes with the fast speed. 

He decided to try something new, and he mowed half the lawn with the slow speed and half with the fast speed. So, we gotta figure out how long it took him to mow the whole lawn.

He took 60 minutes to mow half the lawn with the slow speed, and 40 minutes to mow half the lawn with the fast speed. To find the total time, we just add 'em together.

60 + 40 = 100 minutes

So, it took Chris 100 minutes to mow the whole lawn.

The final answer is 100."
"So, John and Jack gotta get to school, and they got 30 minutes. They already walked to the corner, and that took 6 minutes. Then they walked to the fire station, and that took 13 minutes. So, they spent 6 + 13 = 19 minutes walkin' around.

Now, they gotta know how much time they got left to get to school. They got 30 minutes, and they already spent 19 minutes. So, they got 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left.

They got 11 minutes to get to school without bein' late."
"So, Catherine went to the store and bought some stuff. She bought 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. I'm not really sure how to do math, but I think I can figure it out.

First, I'll multiply the bananas by 2, 'cause she bought 2 kilos. That's 2 x $2 = $4. Then, I'll multiply the oranges by 2, 'cause she bought 2 kilos. That's 2 x $3 = $6. Now, I'll add the apples, bananas, and oranges together. That's $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

So, Catherine paid $14 in total."
"So, Greta and Celinda are bakin' cookies. Greta makes 30, and Celinda makes twice as many, so she makes 2 x 30 = 60. They make a total of 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Then, they eat 10 cookies, so they got 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left."
"So, there's this one twin and one triplet, and the twin is 7 years older than the triplet. They add up to 44 years. I'm gonna try to figure this out.

Let's say the triplet's age is x. Then the twin's age is x + 7. We got two of those, so we gotta add 'em up and set it equal to 44.

x + x + 7 + x + 7 + 7 = 44

Combine the x's and the 7's:

3x + 21 = 44

Now, subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

So, the triplet's age is 7.67. The twin's age is 7.67 + 7, which is 14.67. But wait, we can't have a fraction of a year, right? So, I'ma round it down to 14.

The answer is 14."
"So, John wanna take a nap, but he gotta do his homework first. He got 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of readin', and 20 minutes of history. That's a total of 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John got 3 hours before he gotta eat dinner. We need to convert that to minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the homework time from the time John got before dinner: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

So, John got 100 minutes to nap."
"So, Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. We need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost.

First, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops will cost. We multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10:
10 * $0.40 = $4.00

Now, we need to find out how much 10 candies will cost. We multiply the cost of one candy by 10:
10 * $3.20 = $32.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $36.00.

The final answer is: $36.00"
"So, Rong is savin' 20 coins a month. And Neil is savin' 2/5 more than Rong, which is 20 + 8 = 28 coins a month. 

If Rong saves 20 coins a month, in a year he'll save 20 * 12 = 240 coins. And Neil saves 28 coins a month, so in a year he'll save 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

Now, if we multiply the coins saved by Rong and Neil in a year, we get 240 * 10 = 2400 coins for Rong and 336 * 10 = 3360 coins for Neil.

So, after 10 years, Rong and Neil will have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The answer is: 5760"
"So, John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and they cost $20 each. That's $40 for the vaccines. Then, there's this heartworm check thingy. It's 60% of the whole bill. If John had $125, he spent $100 on the vet visit. To figure out how much he has left, we gotta subtract $100 from $125.

$125 - $100 = $25

So, John has $25 left.

The final answer is $25."
"So, there's this crate of fruit, right? It's got 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. I think I know how much each one costs. 

Bananas cost twice as much as apples, and apples cost 50 cents. So, bananas cost 1 dollar. Oranges are the most expensive, and they cost three times as much as bananas, so they cost 3 dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs. 5 bananas cost 5 dollars, 12 apples cost 6 dollars, and 7 oranges cost 21 dollars. Adding all that together, we get 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars.

So, the total price for the crate of fruit is 32 dollars."
"So, there's this comforter thingy with colored squares on it. It's got 14 red ones, and there's 4 more blue ones than red ones, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue ones. Then, there's 6 more green ones than blue ones, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green ones. And, there's 12 fewer white ones than green ones, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white ones.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68. So, the comforter's got 68 little squares on it. That's a lot of squares!"
"So, there's this thing about chairs at Mia's restaurant. She needs a lot of 'em. There's 42 grown-ups and 15 babies comin' over. And she's got 8 high chairs. Now, she's got 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. That means she's got 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs. 

So, we gotta add up all the people and chairs. 42 grown-ups + 15 babies + 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 65. She needs 65 chairs in total. But she's already got 8, so she needs 65 - 8 = 57 more chairs.

The final answer is 57."
"So, there's this field with 50 deer in it. I heard that 50% of 'em are bucks. That means half of 'em are bucks. So, we gotta find half of 50.

Half of 50 is 25. Now, I'm told that 20% of the bucks are 8 points. That means 20% of 25 bucks are 8 points. To find that out, I gotta do some math.

20% is the same as 0.2. So, I multiply 25 by 0.2 to find the number of 8-point bucks.

25 * 0.2 = 5

So, there's 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"So, there's this class 3B, right? They got points for good behavior, and if they get enough, they can go on a trip. There's Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has 50 points. 

Betty got more points than Adam, and she got 30% more. That's 30% of 50, which is 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. Martha got 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all their points: Adam (50) + Betty (65) + Tom (35) + Martha (105) = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip, so they're missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."
"So, Great Grandma Jones has three kids, right? And each of 'em has three kids of their own. That's a lotta kids! Now, we gotta figure out how many of 'em are her grandkids. So, we multiply 3 kids by 3, and that's 9 grandkids.

Then, each of those 9 grandkids has three babies of their own. That's 9 x 3 = 27 babies. So, there's 27 great grandbabies. That's a whole lotta great grandbabies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss!"
"So, Greta's paycheck is $2400. She puts 50% of that into her retirement account. That's like, half of her money, so it's $1200. Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, which is $480. 

Now, we gotta subtract the money she put away and the car payment from her original paycheck. So, we do $2400 - $1200 - $480. That's $720. She's got $720 left to spend."
"So, there's a box with 20 spots for pencils, but 4 are gone. That means there's 20 - 4 = 16 pencils left. Now, we gotta figure out how many pairs we got. A pair is 2 pencils, so we divide 16 by 2. That's 16 ÷ 2 = 8. So, there's 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"So, there's this lady Hannah and she's got a big fireworks show goin' on in her city. They got 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks in it. That's a lotta fireworks! 

Now, Hannah's house is in a good spot to see some of the fireworks, and she can see 40% of 'em. That's like, 40% of 300 fireworks. To find 40% of 300, you just multiply 300 by 0.4. That's 120 fireworks she can see from her house.

But that's not all, Hannah's also got some fireworks in her backyard. She's got 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks in it. That's 3 x 5 = 15 fireworks. 

So, to find out how many fireworks Hannah can see in total, you just add the fireworks from her house and her backyard. That's 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks."
"So, there's this big group of people goin' to the movies. They got 14 people, and they each need stuff to drink and eat. Each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

First, let's figure out how many drinks they need. 14 people, 2 drinks each, that's 14 * 2 = 28 drinks. Then, they need 3 snacks each, so that's 14 * 3 = 42 snacks.

Drinks and snacks cost $2 each, so we gotta multiply the number of drinks and snacks by 2. 28 drinks * 2 = 56, and 42 snacks * 2 = 84. Now, we add 'em together: 56 + 84 = 140.

So, the group spent $140 on drinks and snacks."
"So there's this Gissela, Gordy, and Gary, and they got trucks. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry more than Gissela's, and I think it's 4,800 pounds. I'm pretty sure I got that right.

So, if we add up Gissela and Gordy's trucks, that's 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Then, when Gary joins, they can carry 11,600 pounds. To figure out how much Gary's truck can carry, we gotta subtract the other two trucks' capacity from the total. That's 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"So, there's this fella Larry, and he's cookin' dumplings for his friends. He's got 8 guys, includin' himself, and 6 gals. The guys ate more dumplings than the gals, and each gal ate 3 dumplings. The guys ate 1 more dumpling than the gals.

So, the gals ate 3 dumplings each, and there's 6 of 'em, so they ate 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Now, the guys ate 1 more dumpling than the gals, so they ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings each. There's 8 guys, so they ate 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

Addin' the dumplings the gals and guys ate, we get 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings. Since there were no leftovers, Larry musta cooked 50 dumplings.

The answer is 50."
"So, Gerald and Julia had some money, and they split it in some kinda way. They had 100 dollars, and it was split between them in a 3 to 2 thing. That means for every 3 parts Gerald got, Julia got 2. So, they had 3 + 2 = 5 parts in total.

Gerald had 3 parts, so he got 3/5 of the money. To find out how much that is, we multiply 3/5 by 100. That's 60 dollars. 

Gerald spent 10 dollars on a book, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left.

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this cat and a turtle, and the cat is super fast, like, way faster than the turtle. The cat can run 15 feet in one second. If we divide that by 5, we get the turtle's speed. That's 15 divided by 5, which is 3 feet per second.

Now, we wanna know how far the turtle can go in 40 seconds. We multiply the turtle's speed by the time, which is 3 feet per second times 40 seconds. That's 120 feet.

The answer is 120."
"So, the firefighters wanna know how many hours they gotta work to reach their goal. They already did some work and made $2100, but they need $6300. 

First, let's see how much more they need: $6300 - $2100 = $4200. 

Now, they make $1400 per hour. To find out how many hours they need to work, we gotta divide the amount they need by the amount they make per hour: $4200 ÷ $1400 = 3.

So, they need to work for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, there's this river, and some city uses 40% of the water from it. Now, they use 80% of that 40% for industrial stuff. That's like, 80% of 40%, which is 32%. 

To find out how much water they use for other things, we gotta subtract 32 from 100. That's like, 100 minus 32, which is 68. 

So, 68% of the river's water is used by the city for non-industrial stuff.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"
"So, there's this lady Alex, and she's teachin' people stuff. She charges 12 bucks a day. We wanna know how much she makes for 2 weeks. There's 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days. Now, we multiply 14 days by 12 bucks a day, and that's 14 x 12 = 168. So, Alex makes 168 bucks for 2 weeks."
"So, there's this ice cream factory, right? They make chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream. They make 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, and 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. We wanna know how many quarts they make in 48 hours.

First, let's figure out how many quarts of chocolate ice cream they make in 48 hours. They make 100 quarts in 2 hours, so we gotta multiply that by 24 (48 hours / 2 hours). That's 100 * 24 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Now, let's do the same for vanilla ice cream. They make 50 quarts in 4 hours, so we multiply that by 12 (48 hours / 4 hours). That's 50 * 12 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, we add 'em together: 2400 (chocolate) + 600 (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"So Marcus bought some stuff. He got 5 croissants, 4 cinnamon rolls, 3 mini quiches, and 13 muffins. The prices were $3.00 for the croissants, $2.50 for the cinnamon rolls, $4.00 for the mini quiches, and $1.00 for the muffins.

First, let's add up the prices. 5 croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00. 4 cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00. 3 mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00. And 13 muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add all those numbers together. $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a special card that gives him 10% off. That means he gets 10% of $50.00 off. 10% is the same as 0.10. So, 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, we need to subtract $5.00 from $50.00. $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is $45.00."
"So, there's this ice cream place that's got a deal. You buy 2 scoops, and they give you 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. 

If you got $6.00, you can buy 4 scoops 'cause 6 divided by 1.5 is 4. But, since you get one free, you can get 3 scoops. That's the deal."
"So, Ginger and Amy got 100 pieces of candy at first. They eat candy every day. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to figure out how many days they eat candy.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days. They eat candy for 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces of candy. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Ginger had 100 pieces of candy, but she ate 56 pieces. So, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left. Amy had 100 pieces of candy, but she ate 42 pieces. So, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.

Now, we need to figure out how much candy Amy has more than Ginger. We do this by subtracting Ginger's candy from Amy's candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"So, Mr. Boarden is fixin' up his bathroom. He needs 24 tiles for every square foot. He wants to cover two thirds of his bathroom, which is 36 square feet. To find out how many tiles he needs, I'm gonna multiply 36 by 24.

36 * 24 = 864

So, Mr. Boarden needs 864 tiles.

The answer is: 864"
"So, James went blueberry pickin' and stuff. He had to pay $20 to get there, and then he paid $1.50 for every pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so that's $1.50 * 30 = $45. Then he added the $20 he paid to get there, so that's $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, if he bought the blueberries at the store, it would cost him $2.50 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so that's $2.50 * 30 = $75. 

To find out how much he saved, we gotta subtract the cost of pickin' from the cost of buyin', which is $75 - $65 = $10.

So, James saved $10 by pickin' his own blueberries.

$10"
"So, there's this company that wanted to buy 500 computers. They had $700 for each one. But then they found out the price went up by 10%. We gotta figure out how much they paid for all the computers now.

First, we gotta find out how much more they paid 'cause of the price increase. That's 10% of $700. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.1. So, 0.1 x $700 = $70. That's how much more they paid.

Now, we add that to the original price: $700 + $70 = $770. That's the new price of each computer.

Next, we multiply the new price by the number of computers they bought: $770 x 500 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"So, we got this thing with eggs, cheese, and ham. Eggs are like, 75 calories each, and we got 6 of 'em. That's 6 * 75 = 450 calories. Then we got cheese, and it's 120 calories per ounce, and we got 2 ounces, so that's 2 * 120 = 240 calories. And ham's 40 calories per ounce, and we got 2 ounces, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. So, the omelet's got 770 calories."
"So, I bought 6 pencils and 8 erasers. Pencils cost 50 cents each and erasers cost 25 cents each. I paid 10 dollars. 

First, I calculate the cost of pencils: 6 pencils * 50 cents = 3 dollars. Then, I calculate the cost of erasers: 8 erasers * 25 cents = 2 dollars. 

Now, I add the cost of pencils and erasers: 3 dollars + 2 dollars = 5 dollars. 

Since I paid 10 dollars, I need to find out how much change I get. To do that, I subtract the total cost from the amount I paid: 10 dollars - 5 dollars = 5 dollars.

The answer is 5."
"So, there's this job at Google, and a lot of people apply. Then, 30% of those people get to meet with the people who work there. That's 30 out of 100. 

Next, 20% of those people who met with them get a job. That's 20% of 30, which is 6 people.

Finally, 1/3 of those people who got a job actually take it. That's 1/3 of 6, which is 2 people.

So, 2 people end up taking the job.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Goldy got 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. I think she gave away a total of 3 + 4 = 7 sacks. Each sack weighs 25 kilograms. So, the total weight of rice she gave away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack. That's 7 * 25 = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"So, Castle bought some cereal boxes. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. Last week, she bought 4 boxes. We need to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week.

Let's count the boxes: 3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes this week. Last week, she bought 4 boxes. To find the difference, we subtract 4 from 8.

8 - 4 = 4

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"So, there's this lady Helga, and she's super good at dancin'. She's got two feet, and she taps 'em both at different speeds. When she's standin' still, she taps her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute. That's a total of 550 times a minute.

Now, when she raises her arms, she taps 'em slower, 200 times a minute for each foot. That's 400 times a minute.

She dances for 5 minutes, but only 2 of those minutes she's got her arms up. So, we gotta figure out how many times she taps her feet in total.

For the 3 minutes she's standin' still, she taps 550 times a minute, so that's 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

For the 2 minutes she's got her arms up, she taps 400 times a minute, so that's 400 * 2 = 800 times.

Add 'em together, and you get 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"So, there's this fella Ron, and he's got a big problem with a pothole in front of his house. It's gonna cost him $450 if it don't get fixed, and if he tries to fix it himself, he's gonna get fined $120. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25.

Let's see, if he fixes the pothole himself, he's gonna spend $120 (the fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $195. But, if he don't fix it, he's gonna lose $450. So, he's saving $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixin' the pothole himself.

The final answer is: $255"
"So, there's this restaurant with a bunch of chairs. They got 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. Then, they sent some chairs to the carpenter to fix 'em. They sent 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs. 

Let's see how many chairs they got left. First, we gotta add the normal and baby chairs together: 170 + 23 = 193. Then, we gotta subtract the chairs they sent to the carpenter: 193 - 33 = 160.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"So, there's this guy Bryce and his four friends, and they all got pizzas after football practice. Each pizza had 12 slices. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. That's like, two-thirds of 12, which is 8 slices. So, they ate 8 slices each, and since there are three of them, they ate 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The other two friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. That's three-quarters of 12, which is 9 slices. So, they ate 9 slices each, and since there are two of them, they ate 9 x 2 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate: 24 + 18 = 42 slices. But wait, there are only 60 slices in total. That means they ate more slices than they had. That's not possible, so let's try again.

Let's say Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is 8 slices. The other two friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices. But we can't have more slices than the total number of slices. So, let's try again.

If Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, that's 8 slices. The other two friends ate 1/2 of their pizzas, which is 6 slices. Now, let's add up all the slices they ate: 8 + 6 = 14 slices.

Now, we subtract the slices they ate from the total number of slices: 60 - 14 = 46 slices.

The final answer is: 46"
"So, we got a cat and a dog, and they both eat sausages. The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes the dog to eat the same amount of sausages. We know the dog eats 2/3 of the time the cat does, so we multiply 30 by 2/3, which is 20 minutes. That's how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

Now, we gotta find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. We do that by adding the time it takes the cat and the dog, then dividing by 2. So, we add 30 and 20, which is 50, and then we divide by 2, which is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"So, there's this guy Topher, and he's super tall, right? He's got huge shoes. One of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We know one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches long. We need to figure out how long one of Bobby's shoes is.

First, we gotta convert 8 feet to inches. There's 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches, so 96 + 4 = 100 inches. That's how long one of Topher's shoes is.

Now, we know that's 10 inches more than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write an equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90. Then we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"So, there's this girl Hannah, and she's all stressed out 'cause she's studyin' for her finals. She goes crazy and starts smashin' windows in the school parking lot. She breaks a quarter of the students' car windows and three-fourths of the teachers' car windows. There's 64 student cars with 4 windows each, and 32 teacher cars with 2 windows each.

First, let's figure out how many windows she breaks for the students. That's 64 cars with 4 windows each, so that's 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

Now, for the teachers. There's 32 cars with 2 windows each, so that's 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Add 'em together, and you get 256 + 64 = 320 windows. So, Hannah smashed a total of 320 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"So, there's this lady named Candy, and she's got a bunch of spools of thread. She's got 15 of 'em light blue, 45 of 'em dark blue, 40 of 'em light green, and 50 of 'em dark green. We need to figure out what percentage of her spools are blue.

First, we gotta add up all the blue ones. That's 15 + 45, which is 60. Now we gotta add up all the spools. That's 15 + 45 + 40 + 50, which is 150.

Now, we gotta find out what percentage 60 is of 150. We do that by dividing 60 by 150, and then multiplying by 100. That's 60 ÷ 150 = 0.4, and then 0.4 × 100 = 40.

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"So, there's this big line of people at a polling station. There's 5000 people in line. By midday, 2/5 of them have already voted. That's 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people. 

Now, that leaves 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people. Then, by 4 o'clock, 2/3 of those remaining people have voted. That's 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, the people who haven't voted by 4 o'clock are 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

The answer is 1000."
"So, there's this fella Parker, and he eats 4 pieces of gum a day. A pack of gum has 15 pieces in it. He wants to know how many packs he needs for 30 days.

To figure this out, we gotta divide 30 days by 4 pieces of gum. That's 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5. But you can't buy half a pack, so we gotta round up. That means he needs 8 packs of gum.

The answer is 8."
"So, we gotta figure out how many s'mores we need. We got 9 kids and they want 2 s'mores each, and 6 grown-ups want 1 s'more each. That's a total of 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores for the kids, and 6 s'mores for the grown-ups. So, we need 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores in total.

Now, we gotta know how many s'mores one box of graham crackers can make. It's 8 s'mores per box. So, we need to divide 24 s'mores by 8 s'mores per box. That's 24 ÷ 8 = 3 boxes.

So, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

Final answer: 3"
"So, Dora's dad is older than her. He's eight more than twice her age. If Dora is 15, that means her dad is 2 x 15 + 8 = 38. That's a big number!

Dora's mom is four years younger than her dad. So, she's 38 - 4 = 34. That's even bigger!

Now, let's add up their ages. Dora's age is 15, her dad's age is 38, and her mom's age is 34. So, 15 + 38 + 34 = 87. That's a lot of years!

The final answer is: 87"
"So, there's this fella, Greg, and he's walkin' down the street with his 3 younger siblings. He finds some cash, and he wants to split it up fair. He's got 4 of 'em, including himself. He's gotta divide the money equally among 'em.

So, we gotta do some math. We take the money, which is $20, and we divide it by 4. That's like, how many pieces of cake you get when you cut a pie into 4 slices.

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

So, each of 'em gets $5."
"So, I got a bunch of books here. There's two math books, two science books, a French book, an English book, and a history book. The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add 'em up: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds. So, the total weight of all the books is 17 pounds."
"So, there's this election thingy. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is like, 20 people out of 100. 

Candidate B got 50% more than A, so that's 30 people. 

Now, we gotta find out how many people voted for C. We take the total number of people (100) and subtract the people who voted for A (20) and B (30). That's 100 - 20 - 30 = 50.

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this guy Boris and he got 100 apples. Then there's this other guy Beck and he got 23 fewer apples than Boris. That means Beck got 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris is left with 100 - 10 = 90 apples. And Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many apples Beck has less than Boris now, we gotta subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples. That's 90 - 87 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"So, Peter wants to make ice cubes with water. He's got 32 ounces of water. He's gonna make some big ones, some medium ones, and some small ones. The big ones use 4 ounces each, the medium ones use 2 ounces each, and the small ones use 1/2 ounce each.

He makes 3 big ones, 7 medium ones, and 8 small ones. To find out how much water he's used up, we gotta add up how much water he's used for each type of cube.

For the big ones, he used 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. For the medium ones, he used 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. And for the small ones, he used 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add all that up: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. He used 30 ounces of water.

To find out how much water he's got left, we subtract 30 from 32: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The answer is 2."
"So, there's this lady named Alice and she's got 6 more books than this other guy named Steven. And then there's this lady named Clara, she's got twice as many books as Steven. We know Clara's got 20 books, so we gotta figure out how many books Steven's got.

We do that by dividin' 20 by 2, 'cause Clara's got twice as many as Steven. That's 20 / 2 = 10. So Steven's got 10 books.

Now we know Steven's got 10 books, we add 6 to that, 'cause Alice's got 6 more than Steven. That's 10 + 6 = 16. So Alice's got 16 books.

Now we gotta figure out how many more books Clara's got than Alice. We do that by subtractin' Alice's books from Clara's books. That's 20 - 16 = 4.

The answer is 4."
"So, there's this lady named Cecelia, and she went to the milk store. They got these jars, one that's a gallon and one that's half a gallon. The gallon one costs $5. The lady found out that the half-gallon one costs $2 less than the gallon one. So, we gotta subtract $2 from $5 to get the price of the half-gallon one.

$5 - $2 = $3

Now, she bought 10 of the gallon jars and 16 of the half-gallon jars. We gotta multiply the price of the gallon jars by 10 and the price of the half-gallon jars by 16.

10 gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

We add these two amounts together to get the total cost.

$50 + $48 = $98

The answer is: $98"
"So, there's a class of 50 students. Some like to bake, some like basketball, and some like video games or music. I think 10 like to bake. And 5 like basketball. If the ones who like music are twice the ones who like basketball, that means they like music too. So, 5 * 2 = 10 like music. 

Now, if we add the ones who like basketball and music, that's 5 + 10 = 15. We can't have 15 people like both, so we subtract that from the total. 50 - 15 = 35. That means 35 like video games or music. But we already know 10 like music, so the ones who like video games are 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"So, there's this guy Jeremy, and he's got 12 birds in his backyard. Then he throws a rock at 'em, and 1/3 of 'em fly away. I think 1/3 of 12 is 4, so 4 birds fly away.

Now, there's 12 - 4 = 8 birds left. Then, 20 more birds come to join 'em. So, we gotta add 20 to 8. That's 8 + 20 = 28.

There's 28 birds in the backyard now."
"So, we got 80 students in total, and they're divided into two classes. That means each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. That's 40% of 40, which is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls. 

To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class. That's 40 - 16 = 24 boys.

The answer is 24."
"So, there's this girl named Mara. She had some cake on a plate, and then she added more. Then she ate some, and then her friend took some. I'm gonna figure out how many slices are left.

First, she had 2 slices on the plate. Then she added 3 more, so now she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Then she ate 2 slices, so now she had 5 - 2 = 3 slices. Then her friend took 5 slices, so now she had 3 - 5 = -2 slices. Wait, that can't be right. I think I made a mistake. Let me try again.

"So, there's this lady named Melissa, and she's a pet groomer. She's got a lot of animals to take care of. There's 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. We need to figure out how many animals she can do each day.

Let's add 'em up: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28. Now, we gotta divide that by 7, 'cause there's 7 days in a week. 28 ÷ 7 = 4.

So, Melissa can groom 4 animals each day."
"So, Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. That's a total of 3 * $1800 = $5400. He finds some cards that are worth a lot of money. There's one card worth $4000 and another one worth $1000. Plus, he gets 30 more cards that are worth $50 each. So, those 30 cards are worth 30 * $50 = $1500. 

Now, let's add up the value of all the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500. 

To find out how much money Mark made, we need to subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"So, there's this thing about two amusement parks. One costs $26 for each grown-up and $12 for each kid, and the other one costs $14 for each grown-up and $10 for each kid. There's 2 grown-ups and 2 kids in this family.

To figure out how much they'll pay for the first park, we gotta multiply the number of grown-ups by the price for grown-ups and the number of kids by the price for kids, then add 'em together.

So, for the first park: 2 grown-ups * $26 = $52, and 2 kids * $12 = $24. Then we add 'em together: $52 + $24 = $76.

Now, for the second park: 2 grown-ups * $14 = $28, and 2 kids * $10 = $20. Then we add 'em together: $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they'll save by choosin' the second park, we subtract the cost of the second park from the first: $76 - $48 = $28.

So, they'll save $28 by choosin' the second park."
"So, there's this fella who sells tomatoes. He used to buy 'em from one place, but now he's gettin' 'em from another place. The new place is cheaper. He sells 500 tomatoes a day, and he used to pay 50 cents for each one. Now he's payin' 40 cents.

Let's see how much he's savin' each day. He used to pay 50 cents, and now he's payin' 40 cents. That's 10 cents less. So, he's savin' 10 cents a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how much he's savin' in a week. There's 7 days in a week. If he's savin' 10 cents a day, that's 10 cents * 7 days = 70 cents.

So, he's savin' 70 cents a week.

The final answer is 70."
"So, there's this guy Carl and he's got a lot of marbles. He's got four times as many marbles as this other guy Sean. And Sean's got half as many marbles as this other guy Cal. We know Sean's got 56 marbles. 

So, we gotta figure out how many marbles Cal's got. We do that by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. That's 'cause Sean's got half as many marbles as Cal. So, Cal's got 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Now, we gotta figure out how many marbles Carl's got. We do that by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4. That's 'cause Carl's got four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl's got 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Finally, we gotta figure out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We do that by adding Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles. That's 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"I don't get it. If there's already 12 groups, then why do we need more? It seems like we already have enough groups."
"So, there's this lady named Candy, and she rents chairs. She rents 60 chairs a day during the week, and 100 chairs on the weekends. We need to figure out how many chairs she'll rent in two months.

A month has 4 weeks. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 20 weekdays. And there are 2 weekend days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 8 weekend days. 

Let's calculate the chairs rented during the week and the weekend separately. 

Chairs rented during the week: 20 weekdays * 60 chairs = 1200 chairs
Chairs rented during the weekend: 8 weekend days * 100 chairs = 800 chairs

Now, let's add them together: 1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

Since we need to know how many chairs she'll rent in two months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2: 2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"So, there's this gorilla named Gunther, and he had 48 bananas. Then, this other monkey, Arnold, took half of 'em. That means Gunther had 48 / 2 = 24 bananas left.

Next, Gunther added 25 more bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. But then, Arnold took 12 bananas, so Gunther was left with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas, and that's when he started countin' 'em. So, he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The answer is 43."
"So, there's this lady Jenna and she's got 4 roommates. They all gotta split the electricity bill. The bill is $100 every month. We need to figure out how much each person owes.

To do that, we gotta divide the bill by the number of roommates. So, we do $100 ÷ 4 = $25. That's how much each person owes every month.

Now, we need to know how many months are in a year. It's 12, I think. So, we multiply $25 by 12 to find out how much each person owes in a year. That's $25 x 12 = $300.

So, each person owes $300 a year for electricity."
"So, Jeff had a bunch of glasses and plates, and some got broken. He had 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses. And he had 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

Then, 10 glasses got broken, and 6 plates got broken. So, we gotta subtract those from the total. 96 glasses minus 10 glasses is 86 glasses. And 48 plates minus 6 plates is 42 plates.

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now."
"So, Lorraine's got some stickers and buttons, right? She's tradin' 'em for the other kind. 

She starts with 30 little stickers and 40 big ones. Then she trades 90% of the little stickers for big ones. That's 0.9 * 30 = 27 little stickers. She's left with 30 - 27 = 3 little stickers.

Now she's got 3 little stickers and 40 big ones. She trades 50% of the big ones for more big ones. That's 0.5 * 40 = 20 big ones. She's left with 40 - 20 = 20 big ones.

She's got 20 big ones and 3 little ones. She trades the rest of the big ones for little ones. She's got 20 big ones, so she trades 'em for 20 * 3 = 60 little ones.

Now she's got 3 little ones and 60 little ones. That's 63 little ones. She's also got 20 big ones.

So, she's got 63 little ones and 20 big ones. That's a total of 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"So, Joey plays football every week. He plays 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday, he plays double the number of matches he played on Monday. I think he plays 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches in a week."
"So, there's this council thingy with 33 people. They're votin' on somethin', and it's supposed to pass. But it's not supposed to pass, 'cause there's more against it. They say there's twice as many votes for it as against it. So, if we say the number of votes against is x, then the number of votes for it is 2x.

We gotta figure out what x is, 'cause that'll tell us how many votes for it there are. We know the total number of people is 33, so we can set up an equation: x + 2x = 33. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 11.

Now that we know x, we can find out how many votes for it there are. We multiply x by 2, and we get 2 * 11 = 22.

The answer is 22."
"So, there's this lady Krissa, and she's gettin' shirts for her preschool kids. She needs a lot of 'em. 

She needs 11 shirts for the littlest size, which is extra-small. Then she needs twice as many for the small size, so that's 2 * 11 = 22. 

Now, she needs four less for the medium size than the small size, so that's 22 - 4 = 18. 

Then, she needs half as many for the large size as the medium size, so that's 18 / 2 = 9. 

And finally, she needs six more for the extra-large size than the large size, so that's 9 + 6 = 15.

So, let's add 'em all up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The answer is 75."
"So, there's this bag that's marked at $140, and it's got a discount on it. I think it's 5% off. To find out how much I gotta pay, I gotta take 5% of $140. That's like, 0.05 times $140. 

So, 0.05 x $140 = $7. Now, I subtract that from the price, which is $140. That's $140 - $7 = $133. So, I gotta pay $133 for the bag."
"So, we got 20 playlists, and each one's got 300 songs. That's a lotta songs, right? Now, we gotta figure out how long they'll last. Each song's 10 hours long, so we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs, and then by the length of each song.

First, we do 20 * 300, which is 6000. Then we do 6000 * 10, which is 60,000. So, the playlists will last 60,000 hours.

The answer is: 60,000"
"So, there's this big race and some people think horse #2 is gonna win. 20% of 50 people think that, which is 10 people. That means 50 - 10 = 40 people are left.

Then, 60% of those 40 people think horse #7 is gonna win. That's 0.6 * 40 = 24 people. So, 24 people think horse #7 is gonna win.

Now, we gotta figure out how many people think horse #12 is gonna win. We already know 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 or horse #7 is gonna win. That means 50 - 34 = 16 people think horse #12 is gonna win.

The answer is 16."
"So, there's this lady Jana and she's got a bunch of puppies. Two thirds of 'em are Pomeranians, and one third of those Pomeranians are girls. We know there's 6 Pomeranian girls. 

We gotta figure out how many puppies Jana has. We know 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, so if we got 6 girls, that means 1/3 of the Pomeranians is 6. To find out how many Pomeranians there are, we multiply 6 by 3. That's 'cause 3 times 1 is 3, so 6 times 3 is 18. So, Jana's got 18 Pomeranians.

Now, we know 2/3 of the puppies are Pomeranians, and we know there's 18 Pomeranians. To find out how many puppies Jana has, we gotta figure out what 2/3 of the total puppies is 18. We can do that by multiplying 18 by 3 and then dividing by 2. That's 'cause 3 times 2 is 6, so 18 times 3 is 54, and 54 divided by 2 is 27. So, Jana's got 27 puppies."
"So, Jayden had some money from sellin' pictures. He got $70. Then his sister Ava gave him some of her money. She had $90, and she gave him half of that. Half of $90 is $45. Now Jayden has $70 + $45, which is $115. The camera costs $200. So, Jayden needs $200 - $115, which is $85.

The answer is 85."
"So, we got three houses and they need shingles. The first house needs half of the total, which is 250 cases. Half of 250 is 125 cases. 

Now, the third house needs double the first house. Double 125 is 250. So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 250"
"So, there's this lady Leila, and she buys 3 cucumbers. Cucumbers cost 2 bucks each, so she spends 3 x 2 = 6 bucks. Then there's this guy Jack, and he buys 5 tomatoes. Tomatoes cost 1 buck each, so he spends 5 x 1 = 5 bucks. And then there's this other guy Chase, and he buys 1 head of lettuce. Lettuce costs 3 bucks. So, we gotta add all that up: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 bucks.

The final answer is: $14"
"So, George has a lot of bananas, like 200. And he has more pears than bananas. I think he has 45% more pears than bananas. That means if he has 200 bananas, he has 200 + 45% of 200 bananas. 

45% of 200 is like, um, 0.45 times 200, which is 90. So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

Now, to find out how many fruits George has in total, we just add the bananas and pears together. That's 200 + 290 = 490 fruits.

The final answer is 490."
"So, Marissa had some money, like $80, and she bought a ball for $20. That means she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. Then she bought candy bars for Jimmy, and they cost $5 each. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we gotta divide the money she had left by the price of each candy bar.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"So, we gotta figure out how much money Sam needs to buy oranges for 4 liters of juice. He needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter, so for 4 liters, he needs 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Now, each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, we multiply 20 kilograms by $3 to get the total cost. That's 20 * 3 = $60.

So, Sam needs $60 to buy oranges for 4 liters of juice."
"So, there's this guy Ezra and he read a lot of books in one hour. He read twice as many books as this other guy Ahmed. We know Ezra read 300 books in that hour. He then decided to read 150 more. We need to figure out how many books they read altogether.

First, we gotta find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read. That's 300 / 2 = 150. Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we add the books Ezra read initially (300) to the books he read later (150), and also add the books Ahmed read (150). That's 300 + 150 + 150 = 600.

So, they read 600 books altogether.

Final answer: $\boxed{600}$"
"So, Tanya teaches at school. She gets paid $15 for every hour she works and an extra $5 if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. That's 4 * 5 = 20 hours. She gets paid 20 * $15 = $300. Plus, she gets $5 for teaching more than 3 classes, so that's $5. Now, let's add that to $300. $300 + $5 = $305.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours. She gets paid 4 * $15 = $60. She also gets $5 for teaching more than 3 classes, so that's $5. Now, let's add that to $60. $60 + $5 = $65.

So, Tanya's total earnings for these two days is $305 + $65 = $370.

The final answer is: $370"
"So, the perfume company has 4 kinds of vanilla scents and 8 kinds of fruity scents. They sell 5 of each kind of vanilla scent and 2 of each kind of fruity scent. To find out how many more vanilla scents they sold compared to fruity scents, we gotta do some math.

First, we multiply the number of vanilla scents sold by 5. That's 5 x 4 = 20. Then, we multiply the number of fruity scents sold by 2. That's 2 x 8 = 16.

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold. That's 20 - 16 = 4.

So, the perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.

The final answer is 4."
"So, there's this fella named Bennet, and he's a farmer. He sells eggplants, and he sells 20 of 'em for $3 each. That's a total of 20 x 3 = $60. He's tryin' to make $135, and he's already made $60, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from the corn.

Now, he's got 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from 'em. To figure out how much he should sell each ear for, we gotta divide $75 by 25. That's $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"So, Tatiana's got 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She's gonna spend some time doin' stuff, but we don't know what. She reads for 3 hours, and then she plays video games for 1/3 of the rest of the time. We gotta figure out how much time she spends playin' soccer.

First, we gotta find out how much time she's got left after readin'. That's 7 + 5 = 12 hours. Then, we subtract the time she spent readin', which is 3 hours. So, 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. That's 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours. So, she spent 3 hours playin' video games.

To find out how much time she spends playin' soccer, we subtract the time she spent readin' and playin' video games from the total time. That's 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we gotta figure out what percentage of her weekend she spends playin' soccer. We do that by dividin' the time she spends playin' soccer by the total time, then multiply by 100. That's 6 / 12 * 100 = 50%.

So, she spends 50% of her weekend playin' soccer.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave some to Brandon, and then he gave some more to Charlie. He kept the rest. 

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. That's 50 divided by 2, which is 25. So, he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 3/5 of 25 is 15. So, he gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"So, Jack is goin' to the museum, which is 150 miles away. He's drivin' 75 miles per hour, so it takes him 2 hours to get there. Then he spends 6 hours at the museum. To find out how long he's gone, we gotta add the time he spent drivin' to the time he spent at the museum.

So, he's drivin' for 2 hours and then he's at the museum for 6 hours. That's a total of 2 + 6 = 8 hours.

The answer is: 8"
"So, Henry needs to put together some toys. He's gotta put 57 cars together and 73 motorcycles. Each car needs 4 wheels and each motorcycle needs 2 wheels. 

First, let's figure out how many wheels he needs for the cars. 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. Then, he needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels. 

Now, add those two numbers together: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels. 

Henry has 650 wheels in a box. To find out how many wheels he'll have left, we need to subtract the number of wheels he needs from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The answer is 276."
"So, there's this laptop that costs $1000. Then, I get a discount, and I gotta pay less. The discount is 20%. I don't know what that means, but I think it's like, 20% of the price. So, I gotta find 20% of $1000.

I think 20% is like, 1/5 or something. So, I'll just divide $1000 by 5. That's $200. That's 20% of $1000.

Now, I gotta subtract $200 from $1000. That's $1000 - $200 = $800. So, I gotta pay $800.

The answer is $800."
"So, Mike wants to get rid of his old movies and get digital ones instead. He has 600 movies. A third of them are in some series, and he can get those for cheaper. 40% of the rest are old movies that cost less. We need to figure out how much it's gonna cost him to get all the movies.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in the series. That's one-third of 600, which is 200 movies.

Now, if he buys those series together, he can get them for 6 bucks each, instead of 10. So, we need to figure out how much that's gonna cost him. We do that by dividing 200 by 6, which is 33.33. So, he's gonna pay 33.33 bucks for the series.

Next, we need to find out how many movies are not in the series. That's 600 minus 200, which is 400 movies.

40% of those are old movies, which is 0.4 times 400, or 160 movies. Those old movies cost 5 bucks each, so that's 160 times 5, which is 800 bucks.

Now, we need to figure out how many movies are left that aren't in the series or old movies. That's 400 minus 160, which is 240 movies. Those cost 10 bucks each, so that's 240 times 10, which is 2400 bucks.

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the old movies, and the rest. That's 33.33 plus 800 plus 2400, which is 3533.33 bucks.

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"So, there's this fruit place where you can pick your own peaches, plums, and apricots. The prices are $2.00 for peaches, $1.00 for plums, and $3.00 for apricots. 

Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums, and 6 pounds of apricots. To find out how much he spent, we gotta multiply the weight of each fruit by its price and add 'em all together.

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 = $18.00

Now, let's add 'em up: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"So, the Llesis family drove and hiked for a long time to get to their vacation spot. They drove really fast, like 50 miles per hour. Then, they hiked, but not as fast as they drove. They hiked at half the speed they drove, minus 5 miles per hour. That's like, 50 divided by 2, then minus 5. So, they hiked at 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, and I think that's a pretty long time. I'm not really good with numbers, but I think you can figure it out. You can multiply the speed by the time, right? So, 20 miles per hour times 1.5 hours is... um... 30 miles.

I think that's the answer."
"So, Ava and Emma got a new video game for their birthday. They play one level and whoever gets the most points wins. They get 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for every berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and she collects 3 more berries. But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. We need to figure out who gets more points.

Let's think about it... If Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, that means Emma gets 5 points less for berries. So, Emma gets 5 * 3 = 15 points less for berries. That's 15 points.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she gets 10 * 8 = 80 points more for enemies. That's 80 points.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she gets 30 * 4 = 120 points more for time. That's 120 points.

So, Emma gets 15 points less for berries, 80 points more for enemies, and 120 points more for time. That's a total of 15 + 80 + 120 = 215 points less for Emma.

Since Emma gets 215 points less, that means Ava gets 215 points more. So, Ava wins.

The final answer is 215."
"So, we got four pizzas and they cost a total of 64 dollars. Two of 'em cost 30 dollars. We gotta find out how much the other two pizzas cost. 

First, we take 64 and subtract 30. That's 64 - 30 = 34. Now we gotta divide 34 by 2, 'cause the other two pizzas cost the same. 34 divided by 2 is 17. So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"So, there's this thing about these two people, Chase and Rider. They ride their bikes a lot. They ride 'em three times a day for five days, and then they ride 'em twice as much on the other two days. I think I figured out how many times they ride in a week.

First, I counted how many times they ride on the regular days. That's 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times. Then, on the other two days, they ride twice as much, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For those two days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times. Now, I add those two numbers together: 15 + 12 = 27.

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week.

The answer is: 27"
"So, Bob had 7 fish in his pond. He had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He went to the pet store and got some more fish. The sales assistant took out 17 fish from a tank with both white and orange fish. When he got home, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's think about this. If Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, that means the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to find the closest whole number. The closest whole number to 4.5 is 4 or 5. If we choose 4, then the number of white fish would be 4 + 4 = 8, and the number of orange fish would be 3 + 14 = 17, which is correct. If we choose 5, then the number of white fish would be 4 + 5 = 9, and the number of orange fish would be 3 + 14 = 17, which is also correct.

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is either 4 or 5.

The answer is: 4 or 5"
"So, there's this fella named Andy, and he's got a car. His car's good for 10 miles per gallon, and gas costs $3 a gallon. He only drives to work from Monday to Friday, and it's 5 miles each way, so that's 10 miles a day. He does that for 5 days a week.

So, how many miles does he drive in a week? 
A) 25 miles
B) 30 miles
C) 50 miles
D) 75 miles

He drives 10 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week, so... 
C) 50 miles

Now, we need to figure out how much gas he uses in a week. We know his car's good for 10 miles per gallon, and he drives 50 miles a week. 
A) 2.5 gallons
B) 5 gallons
C) 10 gallons
D) 20 gallons

He uses 50 miles a week, and his car's good for 10 miles per gallon, so... 
B) 5 gallons

Now, we need to figure out how much that costs. Gas costs $3 a gallon, and he uses 5 gallons a week. 
A) $10
B) $12
C) $15
D) $20

Gas costs $3 a gallon, and he uses 5 gallons a week, so... 
C) $15

The final answer is: $15"
"So, Carrie got some money from her aunt. She got 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

First, let's figure out how much she spent on the quarters. There's 4 quarters in a dollar, so 140 quarters is like 140 / 4 = 35 dollars. She spent all the quarters, so she spent 35 dollars on them.

Now, let's figure out how much she spent on the twenties. She spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 is like 3 out of 5, so she spent 3/5 of 10 twenties. That's 3 * 10 = 30 twenties. Each twenty is 20 dollars, so she spent 30 * 20 = 600 dollars on the twenties.

Now, let's add the money she spent on the quarters and the twenties. 35 + 600 = 635 dollars.

The answer is 635."
"So, Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes and each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. To find out how many fruits he gets, I just add the number of tomatoes and eggplants.

First, I count the tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes = 110 tomatoes
Then, I count the eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants = 32 eggplants

Now, I add them together: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The answer is: 142"
"So, there's this fella Samwell, and he's got an appliances store. He sells TVs, and he's got three kinds: smart TVs, analog TVs, and OLED TVs. He sold a bunch of 'em this week. 

He said one-fourth of the TVs are smart, and one-eighth are analog. That means the rest are OLED. If he sold 40 TVs in total, how many OLED TVs did he sell?

Let's see... if one-fourth of the TVs are smart, that's 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. And if one-eighth are analog, that's 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs. So, the rest are OLED. 

To find out how many OLED TVs there are, we gotta subtract the smart and analog TVs from the total. That's 40 - 10 - 5 = 25. So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

The final answer is 25."
"So, there's this guy John, and he's tryin' to raise money for a school trip. The school is gonna help him out, but not all the way. They're gonna pay half the cost. That means they're gonna give him $150. 

Now, John already has $50. To find out how much more he needs, we gotta subtract the money he has from the money he needs. So, we do $150 - $50 = $100.

So, John is missin' $100.

Final answer: $100"
"So, there's this fella named Carson, and he's got a house that's gonna freeze if it gets too cold. The temperature in the house is 45 degrees right now, and it's gonna be 33 degrees colder at night. That means it's gonna be 45 - 33 = 12 degrees colder at night.

Now, each log of wood that Carson burns makes the house 5 degrees warmer. So, we gotta figure out how many logs he needs to burn to make it 12 degrees warmer. We do that by dividing 12 by 5, which is 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4.

Since you can't burn a fraction of a log, we gotta round up to the nearest whole number. That means Carson needs to burn 3 logs to keep his pipes from freezing."
"So, we got 90 people and we need to put 'em in groups of 9. That's 10 groups. Now, 3/5 of those groups had people bringin' back seashells. That's 3/5 of 10, which is 6 groups. Each of those groups had 2 seashells, so we multiply 6 by 2 to get the total number of seashells. That's 12 seashells.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this train with 172 people on it. Then, at the first stop, 47 people get off, and 13 more people get on. That means we gotta subtract 47 from 172 and add 13. 

172 - 47 = 125
125 + 13 = 138

Then, at the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we gotta subtract 38 from 138.

138 - 38 = 100

So, there's 100 people on the train now.

The final answer is 100."
"So, Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day. He gets $.25 for each one. We gotta multiply the number of caps he finds by the number of days in a month, and then by the value of each cap.

Let's do the math: 10 caps a day * 30 days = 300 caps. Then, 300 caps * $.25 = $75.

So, Damien makes $75 in a month."
"So, Jamie gets paid $20 an hour for 8 hours a day. That's $160. Then, she works some more and gets paid $30 an hour. She worked 3 more hours, so that's $90. Now, we gotta add those two numbers together. $160 + $90 is $250.

The answer is $250."
"So, there's this zookeeper and she's countin' the lions in the enclosure. She's got 12 female lions, and then there's half as many male lions. That's 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Then, there's 14 little lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we just add 'em all up: 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, Mike's favorite jeans are on sale for 25% off. That means he gets 25% less money back. The jeans originally cost $40. To find out how much he'll pay, we gotta calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10. So, the jeans are now $10 cheaper. Now, we subtract that from the $50 bill Mike's got.

$50 - $10 = $40

Mike will have $40 left over after buying the jeans."
"So, there's this company, right? They got 200 employees at first. Then they hire 20 more each month. We need to figure out how much money they pay their employees after 3 months.

First, we gotta find out how many employees they got after 3 months. So, we add 20 to 200, 20 more times. That's like 200 + 20 = 220, then 220 + 20 = 240, and 240 + 20 = 260. So, they got 260 employees after 3 months.

Now, each employee gets $4000 a month. We multiply 260 by 4000 to find out how much they pay in a month. That's 260 * 4000 = $1,040,000.

To find out how much they pay in 3 months, we multiply $1,040,000 by 3. That's $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"So, there's this thing about caroling, right? They're gonna sing some songs. They're gonna sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once. ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. 

So, if they sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, that's 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. And if they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, that's just 240 seconds. Now, we gotta add 'em together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They're gonna be caroling for 540 seconds."
"So, there's this guy Billy, and he gets paid $10 an hour at first. Then, after a while, he gets a raise of $0.50 an hour, so now he's making $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first work anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 an hour, so now he's making $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 an hour.

He works for 20 hours, so he makes $11.50 * 20 = $230.

There's this other girl, Sally, and she starts making $10.50 an hour, which is $0.50 more than Billy's first pay. She also works 20 hours, so she makes $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy makes than Sally, we gotta subtract Sally's pay from Billy's pay: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"So, we got this thing about bread and bagels. Bread costs $2 a loaf, and bagels cost $1 each. We wanna know how much more bread costs than bagels. 

First, we gotta figure out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. That's 3 x $2, which is $6. Then, we gotta figure out how much 2 bagels cost. That's 2 x $1, which is $2. Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread. That's $6 - $2, which is $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"So, there's this fella Pierson, and he scored 278 points in bowling. Now, there's this other fella Nikita, and he scored 11 more than half of what Pierson scored. Half of 278 is 139, and 11 more than that is 150. So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, we gotta add up their scores to find the total. Pierson's score is 278, and Nikita's score is 150. 278 + 150 is 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"So, there's this school thingy where they're plantin' trees. They got 40 classes, and each class has 25 kids and 3 teachers. I'm gonna count the trees.

First, let's count the trees the kids plant. They got 40 classes, and each class has 25 kids, so that's 40 * 25 = 1000 trees.

Now, let's count the trees the teachers plant. They got 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers, so that's 40 * 3 = 120 trees.

So, in total, they plant 1000 trees from the kids and 120 trees from the teachers. That's 1000 + 120 = 1120 trees.

The answer is: 1120"
"So, Bubbles has a bunch of stuffed animals. She's got 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That's a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

She wants to buy some stuffed goats so that they make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find out how many goats she needs, we need to figure out what 30% of 14 is.

30% of 14 is the same as 0.30 x 14. To find 0.30 x 14, we can multiply 0.30 by 10 and then add 3 (since 14 is 10 + 4). So, 0.30 x 10 is 3, and 3 + 3 is 6.

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Kris is tryin' to get this video game thingy. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, and then she plays for 2 hours a day for a week. We gotta figure out how many hours she's played so far.

Let's see... she plays half an hour a day for 14 days. That's 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for 7 days, which is 2 * 7 = 14 hours. So, she's played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours to get this thing, so we gotta subtract 21 from 30. That's 30 - 21 = 9 hours. She still needs to play 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"So, there's these two cars on the highway, right? One's goin' 60 miles per hour, and the other's goin' 70 miles per hour. They're both just cruisin' along, and then the faster one passes the slower one. 

Now, we gotta figure out how far apart they are after two hours. We do that by multiplyin' the speed by the time. For the first car, that's 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles. For the second car, it's 70 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 140 miles.

Since the second car is goin' faster, it's gonna be ahead of the first car. We need to find the difference between the two distances. That's 140 minus 120, which is 20 miles.

The answer is 20."
"So, James buys a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. He pays a 30% premium for it to be made. 

To find the total cost, we gotta add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the premium. 

First, we add the diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900. 

Then, we find 30% of $900. To do that, we multiply $900 by 0.3. 

$900 * 0.3 = $270. 

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring: $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"So, there's this school and they got some test results. They got 340 out of 500 third-graders right, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders right. The fifth-graders, they got twice as many right as the fourth-graders. So, that's 80 fifth-graders right.

Now, let's add up all the kids who got it right: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460. And there's 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids in total.

To find out the pass rate, we gotta divide the number of kids who got it right by the total number of kids, and then multiply by 100. So, that's (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46.

The answer is 46."
"So, Milo's got 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. That's a lotta chips! He wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch. 

To figure out how many square inches he can make, we gotta divide the total number of chips by 12. So, 2 bags of chips is 2 x 72 = 144 chips. Now, we divide 144 by 12, and that's 12 square inches. 

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply 12 square inches by 3, and that's 36 square inches. So, Milo can make a mosaic that's 36 square inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"So, there's this party and they got some tea. They had 10 quarts left. Some students drank a lot of tea, and some drank a little. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, and that's 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, and that's 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

So, the total amount of tea they drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. If they had 10 quarts left, that means they started with 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

Now, we need to figure out how many gallons that is. There's 4 quarts in a gallon, so we divide 48 by 4. That's 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

The answer is 12."
"So Dale's got some butterscotch candies. He had 100 at first, then he got more, and then he sold some. He sold 150, and now he's got 50 left. To find out how many he needs to sell, we gotta figure out how many he's got in total. He had 100, then he got 100 more, so that's 100 + 100 = 200. Then he sold 150, so he's got 200 - 150 = 50 left.

So, Dale needs to sell 50 more butterscotch candies.

The answer is 50."
"So, there's this thing about students on campus. They double every month. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. 

Let's see how many students we get by the end of May. 
- January: 10 students
- February: 10 x 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 x 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 x 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 x 2 = 160 students

Now, we need to find out how many more students joined after the first 10. We take the number of students at the end of May and subtract the original 10. 
160 - 10 = 150

So, 150 more students joined after the first 10.

The final answer is: 150"
"So, there's this fella Felix, and he's always climbin' trees to get stuff out for the kids. He charges 'em a quarter every time he climbs a branch. He made a total of $105 in a week. We need to figure out how many branches he climbed.

To do that, we gotta divide the money he made by the cost per branch. That's $105 ÷ $0.25. That's 420 branches.

Now, we gotta find out how many branches he climbed per day. There's 7 days in a week, so we divide 420 by 7. That's 60 branches per day.

The final answer is 60."
"So Rose is pickin' flowers for a vase. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each, that's 3 x 5 = 15 petals. Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, that's 4 x 6 = 24 petals. After that, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, that's 5 x 4 = 20 petals. And lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, that's 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add all them petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals. But, oh no! She drops 1 of each type of flower. So we gotta subtract 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals. That means we gotta subtract 22 from 101.

101 - 22 = 79 petals.

The answer is 79."
"So, John and DeSean got a bag of marshmallows. It had 35 of 'em. They made s'mores, and they dropped 3 on the ground. That means they got 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.

They made 9 s'mores each, so that's 9 + 9 = 18 s'mores in total. Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause they're sharing. 18 ÷ 2 = 9.

So, each of 'em can have 9 s'mores."
"So, there's this arcade thingy and some dude named Jack is playin' with his friends. They play for 4 hours, which is like, a long time. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, so he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters. That's a lotta quarters, man.

One of his friends is pretty bad and can only play for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. That's 120 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 6 quarters. 

The other friend is also pretty bad and plays for 120 minutes, so they use 6 quarters too.

The other friend is super good and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 minutes = 360 minutes. That's a lot of quarters, dude! They use 360 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so we multiply 42 quarters by 25 cents: 42 * 25 cents = $10.50.

The final answer is $10.50."
"So, Tanya makes a salt scrub and stuff. She puts it in a 10-ounce jar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of salt is x. Then the amount of citrus zest is also x, and the amount of oil is 2x. We gotta figure out what x is.

So, we add up all the stuff: x (salt) + x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (oil) = 10 ounces. That's a lot of stuff!

Now, let's combine like terms: 5x = 10. We gotta get x by itself. So we divide both sides by 5: x = 2.

Now that we know x is 2, we can find out how much oil she uses. The oil is 2x, so it's 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"So, John buys some goats and cows at the market. He buys 3 goats for $500 each, and 2 cows for $1500 each. I'm gonna count the money he spent.

First, I'll count the money for the goats. 3 goats, 3 x $500, that's 3 x 500 = 1500. Then I'll count the money for the cows. 2 cows, 2 x $1500, that's 2 x 1500 = 3000.

Now, I'll add the money for the goats and the cows together. 1500 + 3000 = 4500.

The answer is: $4500"
"So, Paul needs 63 cupcakes for a birthday party. He already has some, but I don't know how many. Let's see... He has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones. I think he has 48 cupcakes in total. To find out how many more he needs, we gotta subtract 48 from 63.

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul needs 15 more cupcakes."
"So, Joe got 20 cars, and he got twice as many as the other guy, Robert. Robert got 20 cars. So, Joe got 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Then, Joe sold 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 8 cars. He sold 8 cars, so he got 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

After that, Joe gave some cars to his mom. He gave away twice as many cars as he sold. He sold 8 cars, so he gave away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe got 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"So, there's this charity thingy, and 20 students are workin' together to help it out. They all get the same amount, and they raised a bunch of cash - $175,000. But, $50,000 of that came from other places, not from the students. So, we gotta figure out how much the students raised.

We take the total amount they raised, which is $175,000, and we subtract the $50,000 that came from other places. That leaves us with $125,000.

Now, we gotta divide that by the number of students, which is 20. So, we do $125,000 ÷ 20.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"So, there's this lady named Sandy. She walked from one place to another, and then she walked back. The first time she walked for 8 hours. Then she walked half that time the next day. Half of 8 is 4, so she walked for 4 hours the next day.

So, let's add those two times together. 8 + 4 = 12 hours. Now, we need to turn that into minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 12 by 60. That's 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"So, there's this guy Hunter, and he's countin' cars in a parking lot. He starts with 50 cars, then 20 more come in, so now he's got 50 + 20 = 70 cars. Then, when he leaves for lunch, half of 'em leave, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars. So, he's countin' 35 cars when he comes back.

The answer is 35."
"So, there's this fella named John, and he does a lot of work. He does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. Each task pays him $1.20. We wanna know how much he makes in a week.

First, we gotta figure out how many tasks he does in a week. We do that by multiplying the number of tasks he does in a day (30) by the number of days in a week (7). That's 30 * 7 = 210 tasks.

Now, we know each task pays $1.20, so we multiply the number of tasks (210) by the pay per task ($1.20). That's 210 * 1.20 = $252.

So, John makes $252 in a week."
"So, Sasha and Julie are playin' basketball, right? They got two games, and I'm gonna figure out how many points Sasha scored.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court, and she scored 14 points. That's a good number.

In the second game, Sasha was at Julie's place, and she scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Then, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add up all the points Sasha scored: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is 18."
"So, there's this lady named Kimberly, and she bought some cat food and dog food. She got 8 packages of cat food, and each one had 11 tins. That's a lot of cat food! She also got 6 packages of dog food, and each one had 6 tins. I counted 'em out, and I think she got 88 tins of cat food. That's a lotta cat food!

Now, I counted the dog food too. She got 6 packages, and each one had 6 tins. That's 6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food. I'm pretty sure that's right.

So, to find out how many more tins of cat food she got than dog food, I subtracted the dog food from the cat food. That's 88 - 36 = 52. I think that's right!

The answer is 52."
"So, there's this thing about these Magic Cards, right? Three people, Becca, Smendrick, and PJ, and they got a bunch of 'em. There's 341 cards in total. 

Now, Smendrick's got 3 times as many cards as PJ. And Becca's got 12 more than Smendrick. We need to figure out how many cards each one's got.

Let's say PJ's got x cards. Then Smendrick's got 3x cards, and Becca's got 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total's 341, so we can set up an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. 

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341. Subtract 12 from both sides, and we get 7x = 329. 

Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 47. That means PJ's got 47 cards.

Now, we can find out how many cards Becca's got. We just add 12 to 3 times 47, which is 141 + 12 = 153.

So, Becca's got 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"So, there's this lady named Cindy, and she went to the park on Easter. She got a bunch of eggs. There's green eggs, blue eggs, pink eggs, and yellow eggs. 

She had 5 green eggs. Then she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 10 blue eggs. Then she had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 9 pink eggs. And she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add 'em up: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"So Milly's gotta return a book. It's heavy, 4 pounds, and it cost her $32. She's gotta take it to the distribution center, which is 20 miles away. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. They'll only give her 75% of the money back.

First, let's figure out how much the shipping costs. She's got 4 pounds, so that's 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. And 20 miles is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. So the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, they're gonna give her 75% of the money back. That's $32 * 0.75 = $24. So she's gonna lose $3.00 (shipping) - $24 (refund) = -$21. But wait, she can't lose money, so that can't be right.

Let's try again. She's gonna lose $32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8.

So Milly's gonna lose $8.

$8"
"So, Mulan got some money from her dad. She had $40 and he gave her $100. That's a total of $40 + $100 = $140.

Then, she buys two pairs of jeans. They cost $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. So, she spent $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we gotta find out how much she has left. We take the total she had, which is $140, and subtract the total she spent, which is $80. That's $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

$60"
"So, Boris has a chocolate factory. He makes a lot of chocolate bars. He makes 8,000 bars the first week. Then, he makes half as many bars the second week. That's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, he makes three times as many bars as the first week. That's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, we gotta figure out how many bars he makes the fourth week. We know he makes 50,000 bars in a month. We already know he makes 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars in the first three weeks. So, to find out how many bars he makes the fourth week, we gotta subtract 36,000 from 50,000.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The answer is 14,000."
"So, Britany makes 18 videos a week on TikTok. She spends 2 hours a week writin' songs and 1.5 hours a week doin' her makeup. To find out how much time she spends on TikTok in a month, we gotta add up all the time she spends on it.

First, let's add up the time she spends writin' songs and doin' her makeup. 2 hours a week + 1.5 hours a week = 3.5 hours a week. Now, we gotta multiply that by 4 weeks in a month. 3.5 hours a week * 4 weeks = 14 hours.

So, Britany spends 14 hours a month on TikTok.

The final answer is: 14"
"So, there's this interior design firm that charges $129 for some stuff. They got 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. And they charge extra for more stuff. They charge $15 per item.

Angela needs some more stuff. She needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We gotta figure out how much she's gonna pay.

First, let's count the extra stuff she needs. She needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures. That's 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 extra items.

Now, we multiply the extra items by the price per item. 13 * $15 = $195.

The total cost is the original price plus the extra cost. That's $129 + $195 = $324.

The final answer is: $324"
"So, there's this guy Roy, and he's got a lot of money. His brother Anthony has some money too, and he's got $10 more than their sister Eva. Eva's got $20. So, Anthony's got $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, Roy's got 40% more than Anthony. That's like, 40% of $30. To find that, I just multiply $30 by 0.4. That's $30 x 0.4 = $12.

So, Roy's got $30 + $12 = $42."
"So, there's this guy Naruto, and he can lift a mountain that's 10 times bigger than this other guy Kagiyami can. And Kagiyami can lift a mountain that's 4 times bigger than this other guy Saskay can. And Saskay can lift a mountain that's 12 times bigger than this guy Pompei can. Pompei can lift a mountain that's 1 inch high.

So, if we start with Pompei, he can lift 1 inch. Saskay can lift 12 times that, which is 12 inches. Kagiyami can lift 4 times that, which is 48 inches. And Naruto can lift 10 times that, which is 480 inches.

Now, we gotta convert that to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 480 by 12. That's 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"So, there's this guy Mason, and he's ridin' his bike. He's goin' pretty fast, 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, then takes a break, and then rides some more. He rides for another 6 hours.

To figure out how far he's gone, we gotta multiply the speed by the time. So, for the first 4 hours, he's gone 8 miles * 4 hours = 32 miles. Then, for the next 6 hours, he's gone 8 miles * 6 hours = 48 miles.

Now, we add those two numbers together to get the total distance. 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"So, we got this thing about kangaroos and turtles, right? They're all tryin' to cross this highway, but they're goin' at different speeds. We know that 3 kangaroos can do it in 18 hours. We need to figure out how long it'll take 4 turtles, and they're goin' half as fast as the kangaroos.

First, we gotta find out how fast a kangaroo is. We do that by dividin' the time it takes 'em by how many there are. So, 18 hours divided by 3 kangaroos is 6 hours per kangaroo. That's how fast they're goin'.

Now, we know the turtles are half as fast, so we divide that by 2. That's 6 hours divided by 2, which is 3 hours. That's how fast a turtle is.

We don't know the distance, but we can figure it out. We know it takes 18 hours for the kangaroos, so we multiply that by 3. That's 18 hours times 3, which is 54. That's the distance.

Now we know the distance and the speed of the turtles, so we can figure out how long it'll take 'em. We do that by dividin' the distance by the speed. That's 54 divided by 3, which is 18 hours.

So, it'll take 4 turtles 18 hours to cross the highway.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, there's this girl Kora, and she made 20 clay dishes. Then there's this other girl Rory, and she made 20 more than Kora, so she made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Now, there's this other girl Jada, and she made twice as many dishes as Rory, so she made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

So, if we add up all the dishes they made, we get 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes."
"So, there's this girl Erika, and she wants a new laptop that costs $600. The sales lady told her that if she gives her old laptop, the price of the new one will go down by $200. Erika thinks that's a good deal, so she agrees to do it. She already has some money in her purse, and she got $150 for her part-time job this week. Her mom also said she can give her $80 to help her out. But Erika still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

To figure out how much money Erika has in her purse, we gotta do some math. We know the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400. Erika already has some money, and she got $150 for her job, and her mom gave her $80. So, we need to add all those amounts together to find out how much she has.

Let's say Erika has x dollars in her purse. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50. We need to solve for x.

x + 230 = 350

Now, we need to figure out what x is. We do that by subtracting 230 from both sides of the equation.

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"So, Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He got 3 big ones and 5 little ones. He cuts 'em up and eats some. He ate 15 slices. Now, how many slices are left?

To figure this out, I counted the big ones first. 3 big ones can be cut into 5 pieces each, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 slices. Then, I counted the little ones. 5 little ones can be cut into 3 pieces each, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 slices. Now, I add 'em together: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so I subtract that from the total: 30 - 15 = 15 slices left.

The final answer is 15."
"So, the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow. He has 3 cows now. He wants to get 25 liters of milk. To find out how many cows he needs, we gotta divide 25 by 5. That's 25 ÷ 5 = 5. 

Now, we multiply 5 by 3 (the number of cows he has now). That's 5 * 3 = 15. 

So, he needs 15 - 3 = 12 more cows."
"So, we got three glue sticks, and they're all kinda used up. One of 'em has 1/6 left, the other one has 2/3 left, and the last one has 1/2 left. They're all 12 millimeters long, right?

To figure out how much glue is left, we gotta do some math. For the first one, we gotta find out how much is used up. If it's 1/6 left, that means 5/6 is used. So, we multiply 12 by 5/6, and that's 10 millimeters. Then we subtract that from 12, and we get 2 millimeters left.

For the second one, we do the same thing. We multiply 12 by 1/3, and that's 4 millimeters. Then we subtract that from 12, and we get 8 millimeters left.

For the third one, we do the same thing again. We multiply 12 by 1/2, and that's 6 millimeters. Then we subtract that from 12, and we get 6 millimeters left.

Now, we add up all the glue that's left: 2 millimeters + 8 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 16 millimeters.

The answer is 16 millimeters."
"So, Gabriel wants to buy a car and a phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800. He already has $5000 from workin' on weekends and his bro gave him $200. 

To find out how much he needs, we gotta subtract the money he has from the total cost of the stuff. 

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

He has $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's subtract: $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"So, Thea bought a hat for $70. She gave the craftsman four $20 bills. We need to figure out how much change she got.

Let's see... if she gave four $20 bills, that's like... um... 4 x 20 = 80 dollars. Then we gotta subtract the price of the hat, which is 70 dollars. So, 80 - 70 = 10.

So, Thea got 10 dollars in change."
"So, Craig got 2 twenty dollar bills, that's 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. He bought 6 squirt guns for 2 dollars each, so that's 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for 3 dollars each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 dollars. 

He spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. Now, we gotta subtract that from 40. 40 - 21 = 19. So, Craig has 19 dollars left.

The answer is: 19"
"So, there's this guy Jack, and he got 60 dishes. He got twice as many dishes as socks, so we gotta divide 60 by 2 to find out how many socks he got. That's 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, Peter got twice as many socks as Jack, so we multiply 30 by 2 to find out how many socks Peter got. That's 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter also got half as many dishes as Jack, so we divide 60 by 2 to find out how many dishes Peter got. That's 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, we add up all the socks and dishes. Peter's got 60 socks and 30 dishes, and Jack's got 30 socks and 60 dishes. So, 60 + 30 + 30 + 60 = 120.

The answer is 120."
"So, there's this class with 20 students. Some of 'em are good at math, some are good at English, and some are good at both. We know 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. The rest, well, they're good at both.

To figure out how many are good at both, we gotta subtract the ones that are good at just one subject from the total. So, we do 20 minus 5 (math only) minus 8 (English only). That's 20 minus 13, which is 7. So, 7 students are good at both.

Now, to find out how many are good at math in total, we add the ones that are good at math only to the ones that are good at both. That's 5 (math only) plus 7 (both), which is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"So, Vicki's got a concert and she's got some rules. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off stage. That's a total of 10 minutes per group. 

Now, she's got a 10-minute break in between. So, we gotta subtract that from the total time of the concert. The concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we gotta see how many groups can fit in 110 minutes. Each group takes 10 minutes, so we divide 110 by 10.

110 ÷ 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

Final answer: 11"
"So, Brenda put $300 into this thingy that makes more money. It's like, it's got some kinda interest on it. The interest is, like, three-fourths of the money she put in. That's $225. 

So, she's got $300, and then she gets $225 more, so that's $300 + $225 = $525. Then, she gets $225 again, so that's $525 + $225 = $750. And then she gets $225 again, so that's $750 + $225 = $975.

The answer is $975."
"So, there's this clothing store with 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, which means 20 of 'em do. Now, 20 out of 50 floral shirts have buttons, so the rest, 50 - 20 = 30, don't have buttons.

We're asked how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. That's 30 - 20 = 10."
"So, the farmer has a lot of eggs, like, 900 of 'em. He puts 'em on a tray, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. I'm not really sure how he does that, but I guess he does. 

So, to find out how many trays he can fill, we gotta divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. That's like, 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray. I think that's 30 trays. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. I don't know why he's selling 'em, but I guess he is. So, we gotta multiply the number of trays by the price per tray. That's like, 30 trays * $2.5 per tray. I think that's $75. Yeah, that's right.

The farmer will earn $75."
"So, Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He got 55 goats on Farm X and 45 goats on Farm Y. Then, he sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. 

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so now he got 55 - 10 = 45 goats on Farm X. He sold 2 times 10 goats from Farm Y, so he sold 20 goats from Farm Y. Now, he got 45 goats on Farm Y. 

Now, let's add the goats on both farms: 45 goats on Farm X + 45 goats on Farm Y = 90 goats.

The answer is 90."
"So, James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. He spends a lot of money on shoes each year. I think he spends like, $2640 on shoes. That's a lot of money for shoes.

To figure out how much he pays for each pair, we gotta divide the money he spends by the number of pairs he buys. He buys 2 pairs a month, so that's 2 pairs a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys 2 x 12 = 24 pairs a year.

Now, we gotta divide the money he spends by the number of pairs he buys. That's $2640 ÷ 24 pairs. That's $110 per pair.

The answer is $110."
"So, we got two kinds of food, right? One's green and the other's red. The green one costs $25 and the red one costs $18. We wanna buy 3 of each. 

First, let's see how much the green ones cost. We multiply 3 by $25, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...$75! That's right, $75.

Now, let's see about the red ones. We gotta buy 3 of those too. That's 3 * $18, which is... *counts on fingers again* ...$54. But wait, we get $2 off for each one! So, we gotta subtract $6 from that. That's $54 - $6, which is... *thinks for a moment* ...$48.

Now, we add the cost of the green ones and the discounted red ones. That's $75 + $48, which is... *thinks for a moment* ...$123.

The answer is $123."
"So, there's this motel called KozyInn, and they got 90 rooms. It takes 'em 20 minutes to clean each room. We wanna know how long it takes to clean half of the rooms. Half of 90 is 45, 'cause 90 divided by 2 is 45.

Now, we gotta multiply 45 by 20 minutes, 'cause that's how long it takes to clean each room. So, 45 * 20 is 900 minutes.

We need to convert minutes to hours, so we divide by 60. That's like, 900 minutes divided by 60 is 15 hours.

So, it takes 15 hours to clean half of the rooms at KozyInn.

Final answer: 15"
"So, the town is gonna build some houses. They're gonna build 12 houses in the first year. Then, they're gonna build three times that many in the second year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 houses. 

In the third year, they're gonna count how many houses they have and double that number. So, they'll count 12 + 36 = 48 houses, and then double that, which is 2 * 48 = 96 houses.

Now, let's add 'em up: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 houses. That's the total number of houses the town will build over the next three years."
"So, I got this thing figured out. There's this thing about me, my brother, my sister, and my mom. My brother's older than me by 3 years, and my sister's younger than me by 2 years. My mom's age is like, one less than three times my brother's age. And when we all add up, it's 87.

Let's say my age is x. Then my brother's age is x + 3, my sister's age is x - 2, and my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1, which is 3x + 8.

We add up our ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87. Now, let's combine like things: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6. But, I don't think age can be a fraction, so I'm gonna round it down. But, I'm not really sure if that's right.

The final answer is 15."
"So, Mr. Jackson's class has 27 students and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. We need to figure out how many packs he needs.

To do this, we can divide the number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). 

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks. This way, he'll have some extra glue sticks left over.

The answer is 4."
"So, there's this river and it's gettin' a lot of water. On the first day, it's 4000 gallons. Then, it gets even more water, like, double the amount, so it's 8000 gallons. Then, on the third day, it gets even more water, 6000 gallons more, so it's 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the answer is 14000 gallons."
"So, there's this thing that's spreading and it infects 10 people at first. Then, each of those people infects 6 others. We gotta figure out how many people are infected after three days.

Day 1: 10 people get infected, and they each make 6 more people sick. That's 10 x 6 = 60 new people. So, now we got 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.

Day 2: 70 people are already sick, and they each make 6 more people sick. That's 70 x 6 = 420 new people. Now we got 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: 490 people are already sick, and they each make 6 more people sick. That's 490 x 6 = 2940 new people. Now we got 490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.

The answer is 3430."
"So, there's this lady named Rafaela, and she got 40 tips from customers at a restaurant. Each tip was $20. That's a lot of money! 

Now, there's another lady named Julieta. She got 10% less money than Rafaela. I think that means she got 90% of what Rafaela got. To find out how much that is, I'll multiply 40 (the number of tips) by 20 (the amount of each tip), and then multiply that by 0.9 (which is 90%).

So, 40 * 20 = 800. Then, 800 * 0.9 = 720. That's how much money Julieta got.

Now, let's add up how much money they both got. Rafaela got 800, and Julieta got 720. 800 + 720 = 1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. That's a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges she gave away.

Now, let's see how many oranges she has left. We take the total she bought, which is 12, and subtract the total she gave away, which is 9. So, 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"So, there's this girl Claire, and she gets a badge every month. That's 12 badges in a year. 

Now, there's this other girl Amber, and she takes twice as long to get a badge as Claire. So, she gets half a badge every month. That's 6 badges in a year.

And then there's Wendy, and she gets three times as many badges as Claire. So, she gets 3 badges every month. That's 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy gets than Amber, we gotta subtract the number of badges Amber gets from the number of badges Wendy gets. That's 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"So, Paige bakes banana bread. She bakes 2 loaves every hour. She bakes for 5 hours, so she makes 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices. She sells each slice for 50 cents. To find out how much she made, we gotta multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. That's 80 * 0.50 = $40."
"So, there's this lady named Gretchen, and she's got some coins. She's got more gold coins than silver coins, and she's got 70 gold coins. We need to figure out how many coins she's got in total.

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. We know the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up an equation: x + 30 = 70. 

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides: x = 40. That means she's got 40 silver coins.

Now, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins to find the total: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

The final answer is 110."
"So, there's this fella George, and he got 600 burritos for his sixth-grade class picnic. There's 50 kids at the picnic, and each kid gets 10 burritos. Then, Mr. George eats 20 of 'em. We gotta figure out how many burritos are left.

First, we gotta see how many burritos the kids got. There's 50 kids, and each kid got 10 burritos. So, that's 50 * 10 = 500 burritos for the kids.

Now, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. We gotta subtract those from the total number of burritos the kids had. So, 500 - 20 = 480 burritos left.

So, there's 480 burritos left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"So, there's this bumper car rink with 12 red cars. They got 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they got 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. Then, they got 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they got 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we gotta figure out how many yellow cars they got. We know the total number of cars is 75. We already know the number of red, green, and blue cars. So, we subtract those from the total to find the number of yellow cars.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

So, they got 23 yellow cars."
"So there's this thing about three people, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn, and they got 85 books together. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. We need to figure out how many books Fawn has.

Let's say Fawn has x books, then Anne has x - 12 books, and Sofie has x - 12 + 25 books. We can add these up to get 85:

x + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85

Combine like things:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books."
"So, there's this lady named Daisy, and she bought some stuff. She got a bag of potatoes, and it weighed 5 pounds. Then she got a bag of sweet potatoes, and it weighed twice as much as the potatoes. That means it weighed 5 x 2 = 10 pounds. 

Now, she got a bag of carrots, and it weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes. So, we gotta subtract 3 from 10, which is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. That's how much the carrots weighed.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, there's this thing called jello that comes in boxes. Each box makes 10 little cups. There's a party comin' up for some kid, and there's gonna be 30 kids. They want each kid to have 4 cups of jello. We need to figure out how many boxes of jello they need.

So, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid gets. That's 30 kids times 4 cups, which is 120 cups. Now, we need to figure out how many boxes they need. We divide 120 cups by 10 cups per box, and that's 12 boxes.

Now, we need to know how much jello costs. It's $1.25 per box. We multiply 12 boxes by $1.25, and that's $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"So, the seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. That's a lot of phones. They gave the seller $4000. To find out how much change they get, we gotta subtract the cost of the phones from the money they gave. 

$4000 - $3500 = $500. That's the change."
"So, there's this lady and her roommate, and they spend $400 a month on groceries. They do this for four weeks. The lady pays 60% of the money, and I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it's like, she pays 60% of the $400. 

So, if she pays 60%, that means the other person pays 40%. I think 40% is like, 40 out of 100, right? So, 40% of $400 is 40/100 x $400 = $160. 

Now, we gotta figure out how much the other person pays per week. There's four weeks in a month, so we gotta divide $160 by 4. That's $160 ÷ 4 = $40. 

So, the other person pays $40 a week."
"So, Tobias got a pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of it on the first day. That's 2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces. Then he ate 10 more pieces on the second day. Now, he's got 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. That's 7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces. So, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

The answer is 48."
"So, we gotta figure out how much stuff David wants to buy. He wants 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

First, let's see how much soda costs. 7 bottles cost $21.00, so 3 bottles will be 3 x $21.00 = $63.00. 

Now, let's see how much water costs. 4 bottles cost $8.00, so 2 bottles will be 2 x $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, we add 'em together: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

The final answer is: $79.00"
"So, David has some money, like $12.48. He wants to buy some bolts, and they cost 3 cents each. He wants to buy 16 bolts. 

To find out how much he'll spend, we gotta multiply the cost of one bolt by 16. That's 16 * 0.03 = 0.48. 

Now, we gotta subtract that from the money he has. So, 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00. 

David has 12.00 left."
"So, Ella gets paid $33 for walkin' dogs for 3 hours. That's like, a lot of money. If she keeps doin' that, how much would she make if she worked for 12 hours? 

Well, we gotta figure out how much she makes per hour. We do that by dividin' the money she made by the number of hours she worked: $33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour. That's a pretty penny.

Now, we gotta multiply that by the number of hours she's gonna work: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132. That's a whole lotta cash!

The final answer is 132."
"So, Paul got some marbles. He had 52, and then his friend gave him some more, 28. Now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. 

Then, he lost some marbles. He lost 1/4 of them. 1/4 of 80 is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles. 

Now, he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles. That's how many marbles Paul has left.

The final answer is 60."
"So Amy's takin' a history test, right? She's got three kinds of questions: multiple-choice, true/false, and long-answer. 

First, let's see how many points she gets from the multiple-choice questions. There's 10 of 'em, and she gets 80% of 'em right. That's 0.8 * 10 = 8 points. 

Next, she's got 20 true/false questions, and she gets 90% of 'em right. That's 0.9 * 20 = 18 points. 

Lastly, there's 5 long-answer questions, and she gets 60% of 'em right. That's 0.6 * 5 = 3 points.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"So, Isaias has a lot of chickens on his farm, like 300. He wants to sell some of 'em, but not all. He's gonna sell 3/5 of 'em. That's like, 3 out of 5, or 60% of the chickens. He's gonna sell 60% of 300 chickens, which is 0.6 * 300 = 180 chickens.

He's gonna sell these chickens for 50 bucks each. So, he's gonna make 180 * 50 = 9000 bucks. But he wants to make 2000 bucks, not 9000. That means he's gotta spend 9000 - 2000 = 7000 bucks on the chickens.

Now, we gotta figure out how much he paid for each chicken. We do that by dividin' the 7000 bucks by the 180 chickens. That's 7000 / 180 = 38.89 bucks per chicken.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"So, there's this thing about lemonade stand. They sold 32 glasses, and Julie sold 14. The boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold the same amount. We gotta figure out how many glasses Micah sold.

We divide 32 by 3, 'cause there's three of 'em. That's 32 ÷ 3 = 10.67. So, Micah and Mitchell each sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, we need to know how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. We take Julie's glasses, 14, and subtract Micah's, 10.67. That's 14 - 10.67 = 3.33.

The answer is 3.33."
"So, there's this lady Iris, and she went to a spa. She spent a lot of money on her hair, which was $400. Then she did a manicure, and that cost her 1/4 of what she spent on her hair. I think that's like, $100. And then she did a pedicure, which cost her 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure. That's like, $75.

So, let's add it all up: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575. That's how much she spent at the spa."
"So, Sarah got a rope that's 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. Sarah wants to use the money she gets to buy a new rope that's 20 meters long, and it costs $1.5 a meter.

First, we gotta figure out how much money Sarah gets for the rope. She's gettin' $2 a meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she gets:
20 * 2 = 40

Now, we gotta figure out how much the new rope costs. It's 20 meters long, and it costs $1.5 a meter, so it costs:
20 * 1.5 = 30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah got:
40 - 30 = 10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buyin' the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"So, Melanie's gonna be 18 in 10 years, that means she's 8 now. We need to find out when she'll be 3 times 8, which is 24. 

We gotta figure out how many years it'll take for her to get to 24. We do that by subtractin' 8 from 24, which is 16. So, in 16 years, she'll be 24."
"So, Kelly's got a bunch of stuff in her cart. She's got 5 packs of bacon, and that's $10. Then she's got 6 packets of chicken, and that's 6 times $10, which is $60. But wait, chicken's twice as expensive as bacon, so that's actually $20. She's also got 3 packs of strawberries, and that's 3 x $4, which is $12. And she's got 7 packs of apples, and that's 7 x $2, which is $14.

Now, let's add it all up: $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56. Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she's got left, we subtract $56 from $65. That's $65 - $56 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"So, Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and she does a 15-minute encore. The whole thing took 65 minutes. We gotta figure out how long her regular concerts are.

First, we gotta take away the encore time from the whole thing. That's 65 - 15 = 50 minutes.

Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause the final concert is twice as long as her regular ones. So, 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"So, Argo had a bunch of toys, like, 200 or somethin'. Then he gave some away. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. I think he gave away a lot, 'cause 40 + 80 + 30 is like, 150. 

So, if he had 200 and gave away 150, that means he's left with... 200 - 150 = 50. Yeah, that's right! Argo's got 50 toys now.

The answer is: 50"
"So, they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. That's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas. Then, on Fridays, they make twice as many, so that's 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas. Now, we add 'em up: 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas."
"So, there's this guy with 50 microphones. He wants to put 'em in pairs, but 20% of 'em can't fit. That means 20% of 50 is 10. I don't know what 20% is, but I think it's like, 20 out of 100. So, 20% of 50 is 10.

Now, he's got 50 microphones and 10 can't fit. That means he's got 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that can fit. Since he's puttin' 'em in pairs, that's 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

The answer is 20."
"So, there's this guy Jerry, and he's countin' birds. He sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then, he sees some birds flyin' around, and that's 2/3 of the birds in the bushes. That's 2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flyin' around.

Now, he sees some more birds, and they're in groups of 8. He sees 3 of these groups. So, that's 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Let's add 'em all up: 6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flyin' around) + 24 (in groups) = 34 birds.

The final answer is 34."
"So, Lani had 55 cookies and she ate 5. That means she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. Now, she put the 50 cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we gotta divide 50 by 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there's 10 cookies in each jar."
"So, there's this lady named Joelle, and she's got 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony. The orchids got 5 petals each, and the daisies got 10 petals each. 

To figure out how many petals the daisies got, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 * 10 = 40 petals. 

Then, we do the same for the orchids: 5 * 5 = 25 petals. 

Now, we subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"So, there's this lady, Mrs. Smith, and she's got 100 plants in her garden. Now, she's got one-fourth of 'em indoors, which is 25 plants. That leaves her with 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Now, two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoors, which is 75 * 2/3 = 50 plants. That means the rest, 75 - 50 = 25 plants, are the flowering ones.

To figure out what percent of the plants are flowering, we gotta divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. That's 25 / 100 * 100 = 25%.

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25."
"So, there's this thing called a whirligig, and it spins real fast. It spins like, five times faster than this other thing called a thingamabob. And then there's this other thing, a whatchamacallit, and it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

So, we gotta figure out how fast the thingamabob spins. We can do that by dividing 121 by 11, 'cause the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster. That's 121 ÷ 11 = 11. So, the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, and the whirligig spins five times faster. So, we multiply 11 by 5 to get the whirligig's speed. That's 11 × 5 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"So, Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. That means the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Ellen pays $11 in total. To find out how much she pays for the carrots, we need to subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total. So, $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day."
"So, this guy Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's a lotta hours. He used to make $10 an hour, but they gave him a raise. They gave him $2 more an hour. So now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour.

He works 8 hours a day, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week. Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week. That's $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"So, Tasha made $80 from sellin' lemonade and cuttin' lawns. She cut Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she cut Joe's lawn, and then she cut Alba's lawn five times as many times as she cut Joe's lawn. Joe paid her $6 for his lawn. 

Let's say she cut Joe's lawn x times. Then, she cut Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total amount she earned from cuttin' lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from cuttin' lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 6x = 80.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 80 / 6. That's x = 13.33. But we can't cut a lawn a fraction of a time, so we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she cut Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she cut Kamala's and Alba's lawns: Kamala's lawn was 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times, and Alba's lawn was 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times.

The total amount she earned from cuttin' lawns is 6 * 13 + 39 + 65. That's 6 * 13 = 78, plus 39, plus 65. That's 78 + 39 + 65 = 182.

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from cuttin' lawns from the total amount she made: 80 - 182. That's -102. Wait, that can't be right. I think I made a mistake.

Let me try again. If she made $80 from sellin' lemonade, and she made $182 from cuttin' lawns, that means she made a total of 80 + 182 = 262. But that's not right. I think I made another mistake.

Let me think about this some more. If she made $80 from sellin' lemonade, and she made $6 from Joe's lawn, that means she made 80 - 6 = 74 from Kamala's and Alba's lawns. Since she cut Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she cut Joe's lawn, and she cut Alba's lawn five times as many times as she cut Joe's lawn, that means she cut Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that 3x + 5x = 74. That's 8x = 74. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 74 / 8. That's x = 9.25. But we can't cut a lawn a fraction of a time, so we'll round down to 9.

Now that we know she cut Joe's lawn 9 times, we can find out how many times she cut Kamala's and Alba's lawns: Kamala's lawn was 3x = 3 * 9 = 27 times, and Alba's lawn was 5x = 5 * 9 = 45 times.

The total amount she earned from cuttin' lawns is 6 * 9 + 27 + 45. That's 6 * 9 = 54, plus 27, plus 45. That's 54 + 27 + 45 = 126.

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from cuttin' lawns from the total amount she made: 80 - 126. That's -46. Wait, that can't be right. I think I made another mistake.

"So, there's this guy Martin, and he weighs 55 kg. Then there's Carl, and he weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg. 

Now, there's Christian, and he weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg. 

Lastly, there's Harry, and he weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is 74."
"So, John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. He gets paid $25 an hour. He also has a car payment of $500. 

To figure out how much money he makes, we gotta multiply the number of hours he works by the amount he gets paid per hour. That's 10 hours * $25 per hour = $250. Then, we gotta subtract the car payment from that. So, $250 - $500 = -$250. That means he's actually losing money.

The final answer is: -$250"
"So, there's this lady Martha and she had some notebooks. Then she bought some more. She ended up with 7 notebooks. She had 3 times as many notebooks as this guy Joseph. We need to figure out how many notebooks Joseph had.

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. Martha had 3 times as many, so she had 3x notebooks. We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so we can set up an equation: 3x = 7. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 7 / 3. That's x = 2.33. So Joseph had about 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to figure out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's: 7 - 2.33 = 4.67.

The answer is 4.67."
"So, Dijana and Anis went rowing on a Sunday. Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed more miles than Dijana, and that's 1/5 more. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we gotta do some math. 

We take Dijana's miles, which is 50, and we multiply it by 1/5. That's like taking 50 and moving the decimal point one spot to the right, so it's 10. Then we add that to Dijana's miles, which is 50. So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now we gotta add Dijana's miles and Anis's miles to find the total. That's 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is 110."
"So, there's this lady, Susan, and she made 100 cookies for her nephews. But then her husband, he's a sneaky one, he took 4 cookies for himself. Now we gotta figure out how many cookies each nephew is gonna get.

We gotta take the total number of cookies, which is 100, and subtract the cookies the husband took, which is 4. That leaves us with 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, we gotta divide those 96 cookies among 6 nephews. That's 96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies per nephew.

So, each nephew is gonna get 16 cookies."
"So Denise and Daniel was readin' the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. That means Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. Daniel didn't read any pages today.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today. So, she read 10 + 18 = 28 pages in total. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read 13 pages in total.

Now, let's see how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. We gotta subtract Daniel's total pages from Denise's total pages. That's 28 - 13 = 15.

The answer is 15."
"So, Calvin's got a pot of soup for his family. He's got enough soup for 4 grown-ups or 8 kids. He's eatin' with his wife and 2 kids. That's 4 grown-ups, so he's got 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, they're all gonna eat dinner, and that's 4 bowls again. So, there's no soup left for lunch. 

Since there's no soup left, the kids can't have any for lunch."
"So, there's this shop that sells notebooks and ballpens. Notebooks cost $1.50 each and ballpens cost $0.50 each. William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen. To find out how much he spent, I counted the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen.

5 notebooks cost 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
1 ballpen costs $0.50

So, the total amount he spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

The answer is: $8"
"So, there's this lady named Jo, and she makes face masks. She can make 4 small ones with 2 yards of material and 3 big ones with 2.25 yards of material. We need to figure out how much material she needs to make 20 small and 8 big ones.

First, let's see how much material she needs for the small ones. She makes 4 small ones, and each one needs 2 yards of material. So, we multiply 4 by 2, which is 8 yards. Then, we do the same for the big ones. She makes 8 big ones, and each one needs 2.25 yards of material. We multiply 8 by 2.25, which is 18 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and big ones together. 8 yards (for small ones) + 18 yards (for big ones) = 26 yards.

So, Jo needs 26 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 big face masks.

The final answer is: 26"
"So, there's this lady named Deepa, and she went to see 9 movies, and she went to each one 3 times. She spent a lot of money, like, $216. We need to figure out how much she paid per movie.

To do that, we gotta divide the money she spent by the number of movies. So, we got 9 movies, and she went to each one 3 times, so that's 9 x 3 = 27 tickets.

Now, we divide the money she spent, $216, by the number of tickets, 27. That's $216 ÷ 27 = $8.

So, she paid $8 per ticket."
"So, Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Let's add up all the hours he spends doin' stuff: 10 (sleepin') + 8 (workin') + 1 (walkin' dog) = 19 hours

Now, we gotta subtract those hours from the whole day, which is 24 hours. So, 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"So, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue ones and 1/3 of the red ones. 

To find out how many blue ones he has left, we gotta subtract 3 from 7. That's 7 - 3 = 4 blue ones left.

Now, we gotta figure out how many red ones he used. We gotta do 1/3 of 9. That's 9 divided by 3, which is 3. So, he used 3 red ones.

Now, we subtract 3 from 9 to find out how many red ones he has left. That's 9 - 3 = 6 red ones left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The answer is: 10"
"So, Sarah got 9 books. Joseph got twice as many, so he got 9 * 2 = 18 books. But then he lost 2, so he got 18 - 2 = 16 books."
"So, Dean has 30 marbles. He gives some to Jamie and some to Donald. He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. That's like, half of 30, so he gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Then he gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, he gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. We take the original amount of marbles, 30, and subtract the marbles he gave away, 16. That's 30 - 16 = 14.

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The answer is: 14"
"So, there's this fella named Duncan, and he's 60 years old now. Eight years ago, his age was twice the age of this other fella, Adam. We need to figure out how old Adam is now.

Let's say Adam's age now is x. Eight years ago, Adam was x - 8 years old. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation: 
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we add 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find x:
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam is 30 years old now. To find out how old he'll be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is 38."
"So, there's this farmer named Brown, and his farm is 200 acres. Then there's this other farmer, Smith, and his farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Brown's farm. Twice 200 is 400, and 100 more than that is 500. So, Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, we gotta add 'em together. 200 (Brown's farm) + 500 (Smith's farm) = 700 acres. That's the total."
"So, this guy Colby works at a factory, and he gets paid 20 cents for every package he makes. He makes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. That means he makes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He works for 8 hours a day, so he makes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a day. He gets paid 20 cents for each package, so he makes 320 * 0.20 = 64 dollars a day.

The final answer is: $64"
"So, there's this guy John, and he drinks water every half hour. He does these puzzles, and they take him a while. There's a normal one that takes 45 minutes, and then there's this super hard one that takes 4 times as long. So, the super hard one takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we gotta add those two times together to see how long he spends on puzzles. 45 + 180 = 225 minutes. That's a long time!

Since he drinks water every half hour, we gotta divide that by 30 to see how many bottles he drinks. 225 / 30 = 7.5. That's a lot of water!

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"So, there's this guy Benny, and he's throwin' bologna at balloons. He throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at some balloons, and there were 20 red ones.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna he threw at the red balloons. He's got 20 red ones, and he throws 2 pieces of bologna at each one. So, that's 20 x 2 = 40 pieces of bologna.

Now, we gotta figure out how many pieces of bologna he threw at the yellow balloons. We know he threw a total of 58 pieces, and 40 of 'em were at the red ones. So, that means 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna were at the yellow balloons.

Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, so we gotta divide 18 by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there are. That's 18 ÷ 3 = 6.

So, there's 6 yellow balloons."
"So, Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. To figure out how many tune-ups he needs, we gotta do some math.

He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles. Now, we gotta see how many groups of 1000 miles are in 3000 miles. That's 3000 / 1000 = 3. So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups."
"So, Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. Then, he works twice that on Wednesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find out how many hours he works in total, I just add 'em up: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is 23."
"So, there's these two girls, Julia and Nadine. They got the same amount of money from their mom. They spent some of it on a cake that cost $11, and some on balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2, so that's $6 for 12 balloons. They also bought 2 ice cream tubs for $7 each, so that's $14. 

The total they spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31. Since they had the same amount of money, we gotta divide that by 2. $31 / 2 = $15.5.

So, their mom gave each of 'em $15.50."
"So, Kira bought some apples, bananas, and oranges. She had 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. Then, Lola ate some of the fruit. I counted the apples, bananas, and oranges, and I got 3 + 5 + 6 = 14. Lola ate 2, so I subtract 2 from 14, and I got 12. There's 12 pieces of fruit left."
"So, there's this thing about tennis and volleyball and soccer. There's 6 kids playin' tennis, and there's twice as many playin' volleyball, so that's 6 * 2 = 12. Then there's 16 boys and 22 girls playin' soccer. 

So, let's add 'em all up: 6 + 12 + 16 + 22 = 56. That's the total number of kids."
"So, there's this class with 30 students. They sold lollipops that cost $0.8 each. Each student sold 10 lollipops. They bought the lollipops for $0.5 each. We need to figure out how much money they made.

First, we need to know how many lollipops they sold in total. We do that by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold. That's 30 students * 10 lollipops = 300 lollipops.

Now, we need to know how much profit they made on each lollipop. That's the price they sold it for minus the price they bought it for. So, $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3 profit per lollipop.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the profit per lollipop. That's 300 lollipops * $0.3 profit = $90.

So, the class made $90 from selling lollipops.

$90"
"So, Larry has a bunch of pets. He's got 3 cats. Then he's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. He's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He's also got a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 fish. And he's got a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so that's 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The answer is 47."
"So, we got a loaf of bread and it's got 24 slices. There's this girl Abby, she eats 2 slices a day. And there's this other guy Josh, he eats twice as much as Abby. So, Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how long the bread's gonna last. We add Abby and Josh's slices together, that's 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day. 

We take the total number of slices in the loaf, which is 24, and divide it by the number of slices they eat in a day, which is 6. That's 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is 4."
"So, Martha's been collectin' shells since she was 5 years old. She gets one shell every month. We need to figure out how many shells she's got now that she's 10 years old.

She's been collectin' shells for 5 years. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 years by 12 months:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since she gets one shell every month, we multiply 60 months by 1 shell/month:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha's got 60 shells."
"So, Lana's got 27 cups of tea and she's makin' 3 rows. She's puttin' equal amounts of chamomile and mint in each row. That means she's got 27 cups in total, and she's usin' 15 of 'em for cinnamon tea. That leaves her with 27 - 15 = 12 cups of mint tea.

Now, she's puttin' 'em in 3 rows. To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we gotta divide 12 by 3. That's 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

So, there's 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"So, there's this sloth, and it's slow, and it only eats when it's up in its tree. It takes it 4 hours to go down, pick berries, and come back up. It wants to get 24 berries in 8 hours. 

To figure out how many berries it can get per trip, we gotta see how many trips it can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours for a round trip, it can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we gotta divide the total number of berries it wants (24) by the number of trips (2). That's 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

So, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"So, we got a pool with 10,000 gallons of water. My buddy and his dad, they fill up a tank with half the water from the pool. That's 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons. They use that water to water their garden. The tank empties out 500 gallons a day. So, after 6 days, how much water's left in the tank?

Let's do the math: 5,000 - (500 * 6) = 5,000 - 3,000 = 1,000 gallons.

So, there's 1,000 gallons of water left in the tank.

The final answer is: 1000"
"So, Colby's parents give him $150 every month. He already spent some money on popcorn and candy. He had 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy. Popcorn costs $8 and candy costs $2.

He spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he spent $8 + $8 = $16. Now he has $150 - $16 = $134.

It's Friday, and tickets cost $10. He wants to buy a ticket, so he'll spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since he can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

The answer is 12."
"So, there's this fella named Andrew, and he bakes a bunch of mini pastries. He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. 

A normal cinnamon roll is like, super big, and it's got 600 calories. But Andrew made mini ones, so they got 1/3 of that, which is 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin is also big, and it's got 450 calories. But Andrew made mini ones, so they got 1/3 of that, which is 150 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories of all the pastries. 200 mini cinnamon rolls times 200 calories is 40,000. 300 mini blueberry muffins times 150 calories is 45,000. 

So, the total calories is 40,000 plus 45,000, which is 85,000 calories.

The final answer is 85,000."
"So, Rita's got a thing with them Junebugs, huh? She's always pickin' 'em off her plants. Let's see, she picked 39 on Monday. Then she picked twice as many on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 x 39 = 78. That's a lotta bugs!

So, she picked 39 + 78 = 117 bugs on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then she picked 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday. Let's add 'em all up: 39 + 117 + 48 + 57 = 261 bugs.

Now, we gotta figure out the average. That's like, how many bugs per day, right? There's 5 days, so we divide the total bugs by 5. That's 261 ÷ 5 = 52.2.

So, Rita picks about 52.2 Junebugs per day.

The final answer is 52.2."
"So, we got two vehicles, a bus and a car. The bus goes 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. That's like, a long time, right? So, the bus goes 60 x 5 = 300 miles.

The car, on the other hand, goes 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. That's like, a shorter time, so the car goes 30 x 8 = 240 miles.

Now, we wanna know how much farther the bus went than the car. We do that by subtractin' the car's distance from the bus's distance. So, 300 - 240 = 60.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"So, Sophie got some toys for her nephew. There's a bag of blocks, a bin of stuffed animals, and a tower of rings. The blocks have 31, the stuffed animals have 8, and the rings have 9. Then, she got some bouncy balls. Now she has 62 toys. 

To find out how many bouncy balls she got, we gotta subtract the other toys from the total. So, we do 62 - 31 - 8 - 9. That's 62 - 48. 62 minus 48 is 14.

The answer is 14."
"Let's try to figure out the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's say Jean's age is J. Then Paul's age is J + 10. And Peter's age is J + (J + 10), which is 2J + 10.

We can write an equation based on the combined age:

2J + 10 + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3J = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

J = 30

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul's age = J + 10
= 30 + 10
= 40

And Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age
= 40 + 30
= 70

So, the ages are:
- Jean: 30
- Paul: 40
- Peter: 70

The final answer is: 70"
"So, Maria had some water balloons. She gave 2 to each of her 4 friends, and she had 1 for herself. That's a total of 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 balloons. Then, her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. There's 5 people, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 more balloons. Now, we add those to the 5 balloons Maria already had. 5 + 15 = 20."
"So, there's this charity group and they're havin' a yard sale. They got 10 people, and each one of 'em donates 5 boxes of stuff. That's a lotta boxes! They also already got 10 boxes of their own. So, let's add 'em up.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Now, they can fit 2 boxes on each table. They already got 15 tables, so let's see how many more tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already got 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The answer is 15."
"So, there's this watermelon seed spittin' contest between Zoey and Sydney. Zoey's got 40 seeds and she spits 'em all 10 feet. That's 40 * 10 = 400 feet. 

Sydney's got 35 seeds and she spits 'em all 12 feet. That's 35 * 12 = 420 feet. 

Now, we gotta add those two numbers together: 400 + 420 = 820 feet. 

To find the average, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause there's two people. So, 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The answer is 410 feet."
"So Fern is tryin' to decide between them two machines, the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, we gotta figure out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. There's 30 days in a month, and 24 hours in a day. So, we multiply the number of widgets each machine makes in an hour by the number of hours it runs in a day, then by the number of days in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, we gotta figure out how much money Fern will make from each machine. We multiply the number of widgets each machine makes by the price of each widget, which is $6. So, the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43,200 widgets * $6 = $259,200. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32,400 widgets * $6 = $192,000.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"So, there's this hotel in the Philippines. They got two prices for a stay: 1000 pesos for 12 hours, and 1600 pesos for 24 hours. Now, there's this guy Cameron, and he's gonna stay for 5 hours more than 12 hours. He's gonna pay 70 pesos for every hour after 12 hours.

Cameron's gonna pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Then, he's gonna pay 70 pesos for each of the 5 hours he stays after that. So, that's 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. 

Now, let's add those two numbers together: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. 

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for 24 hours. If Cameron stays for 24 hours, he'd pay 1600 pesos. So, if he stays for 17 hours (12 hours + 5 hours), he'd pay 1350 pesos. That's 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"So, Nate's got a bunch of goats and sheep, and he needs to feed 'em. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice that. That means each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There's 15 goats, so they need 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay. And there's 12 sheep, so they need 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we just add 'em together: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The answer is 159."
"So, John makes 50 bucks an hour and works for 6 hours, that's 50 * 6 = 300 bucks. Then he spends 50 bucks on gas, so he's left with 300 - 50 = 250 bucks.

He buys 5 pencils for 10 bucks each, that's 5 * 10 = 50 bucks. Now he's got 250 - 50 = 200 bucks left.

He wants to put 100 bucks in the bank, so he's left with 200 - 100 = 100 bucks.

Now, he's got 100 bucks and he wants to buy pens that cost 25 bucks each. So, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

The final answer is 4."
"So, Craig and his brother are doin' this thing where they spell out words and count the letters. They do this for 10 rounds. Craig spells out 20 words with 15 letters each. That's a lot of letters, right?

Craig's brother spells out words that have 50 more letters than Craig. So, we gotta add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled out. 

Let's do the math: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters. Then, we add 50 to that: 300 + 50 = 350.

So, the total number of letters they spelled out is 350."
"So, there's this thing about kids standin' in rows for a celebration. They're standin' 8 in a row, and there's 7 rows. We gotta figure out how many kids are there in total.

Let's see... if they're standin' 8 in a row, that's like 8 kids in one line. And there's 7 of those lines. So, we gotta multiply 8 by 7.

8 * 7 = 56

So, there's 56 kids in total."
"So, there's this teacher and she's got 29 students in her class. She's got 9 coupons, and each coupon can get her 100 bottles of apple juice. She gives 2 bottles to each student. 

First, let's figure out how many bottles she gives to the students. There's 29 students, and each gets 2 bottles, so that's 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. 

Now, she's got 9 coupons, and each one gets 100 bottles, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles. 

To find out how many bottles she's got left, we subtract the bottles she gave to the students from the total number of bottles she got. That's 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left."
"So, there's this lady Patty, and she charges to come to people's houses to fix stuff. She charges $40 just to come, and then she charges $35 for every hour she works, or a little bit more if the hour is a whole number. 

One time, she came to a house and it took her 2.25 hours to fix it. She used $60 worth of parts. So, we gotta figure out how much she charged in total.

First, we gotta figure out how much she charged for the time she worked. Since she charges $35 per hour, and she worked 2.25 hours, we gotta round that up to $35 because you can't pay a fraction of an hour. So, she worked 3 hours. 

3 hours * $35 per hour = $105

Now, we add the $40 she charged to come, the $60 she spent on parts, and the $105 she charged for the time she worked. 

$40 + $60 + $105 = $205

So, Patty charged $205 in total.

The final answer is: $205"
"So, James got 10 CDs, and each one cost $15. But he got 'em for 40% off. That means he paid 60% of the price. 

60% of $15 is 0.6 * $15 = $9. So, James paid $9 for each CD. 

He bought 10 CDs, so he paid 10 * $9 = $90.

Then, he sold 5 CDs for $40 each. He made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he paid.

Money James was out = Amount paid - Amount made
= $90 - $200
= -$110

James was out $110."
"So Jen's got some root crops she wanna sell. She's got 6 yams, and they're worth $1.5 each. That's 6 * 1.5 = 9 dollars. Then she's got 10 sweet potatoes, and they cost 2 dollars each. That's 10 * 2 = 20 dollars. And she's also got 4 carrots, and they're worth 1.25 dollars each. That's 4 * 1.25 = 5 dollars.

So, let's add 'em all up: 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 dollars. That's how much she's gonna make if she sells all her root crops."
"So, James is swimmin' across a lake, and it's 20 miles long. He swims 60% of that, which is 12 miles. He swims that part in 6 hours, 'cause he's swimmin' at 2 miles per hour.

Then, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as he swam, so he rests for 3 hours.

After that, he's gotta swim the rest of the way, which is 8 miles. But he's only swimmin' at half the speed, so it takes him 8 hours to swim that part.

So, the total time James spends swimmin' is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"So, there's this bakery and they got 40 less than seven times how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Sam had 70 loaves last Friday. 

We gotta multiply 70 by 7 to find out how many loaves the bakery had before subtractin' 40. That's 70 * 7 = 490. 

Now, we gotta subtract 40 from 490. That's 490 - 40 = 450. 

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"So, there's this girl Jasmine, and she gets stickers for doin' stuff. She gets 15 stickers for bein' in class, but then she loses some during playtime. She loses 7 stickers, so we gotta subtract 7 from 15. That's 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gives her some more stickers for helpin' out her friends. She gets 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8. That's 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers now."
"So, there's this fella named Cayley, and he's tryin' to make some cash by sellin' newspapers. He gets 10% of the money from the New York Times and 8% from the Wall Street Journal. He sells 6 of the New York Times and 10 of the Wall Street Journal. Each New York Times costs $5, and each Wall Street Journal costs $15.

First, let's figure out how much he makes from the New York Times. He sells 6 of 'em, and he gets 10% of the price. That's 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3.

Now, let's do the same for the Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 of 'em, and he gets 8% of the price. That's 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12.

So, add 'em together: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"So, there's this fella Marcus, and he's half the age of this other fella Leo. And then there's Deanna, who's 26 years old. 

We know Deanna's age, so we can figure out Marcus's age by subtractin' 5 from hers. That's 'cause Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we gotta multiply Marcus's age by 2 to find Leo's age. That's 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

The answer is 42."
"So, there's this thing about three people, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar, and they scored some points. They added up to 45 points. 

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo. And it was also 10 more than Dinar. 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. Then Bahati scored x + 10 points. And Azibo scored x + 10 - 20 points. 

We got a total of 45 points, so we can add those up:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45

Combine the x's and the numbers:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 18.33

So, Dinar scored 18.33 points. But you can't score a fraction of a point, so let's round down to 18 points.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored 18 + 10 - 20 points
= 8 points

Therefore, Azibo scored 8 points.

Answer: 8"
"So, we got a book that's 1.5 inches thick. It's made of paper, and each piece of paper is 100 pages long, but it's printed on both sides. That means each piece of paper has 2 pages on it. 

To find out how many pages are in the book, we gotta multiply the number of pages per piece of paper by the number of pieces that fit in the book. Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we gotta figure out how many pieces of paper fit in that space. 

There's 100 pages per inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick, so we divide 1.5 by 0.5 (which is half of 1.5) to find out how many pieces of paper fit in the book. That's 3 pieces of paper. 

Now, we multiply the number of pieces of paper by the number of pages per piece, which is 2. So, 3 pieces * 2 pages = 6 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"So, Vince is staplin' reports. He can do 30 reports in 15 minutes. We gotta figure out how many minutes he worked. He worked from 8 in the mornin' till 11 at night. That's 3 hours, and that's 180 minutes. Plus, he worked some more after 12, so that's another 480 minutes. 

So, total minutes worked is 180 + 480 = 660 minutes. Now, we gotta divide that by 15 to find out how many reports he stapled. That's 660 / 15 = 44.

The answer is 44."
"So, there's this lady, Kim, and she got a camera in her room to see how much she sleeps. She usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. But one day, she woke up early to go to the bathroom, and she also sleepwalked a bit.

She woke up at 2:15 a.m. instead of 2:00 a.m. and she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so that's 5 minutes.

Now, we need to figure out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day. We know she usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. But we need to subtract the time she woke up early and the time she was sleepwalking.

So, we subtract the 5 minutes she woke up early and the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking. That's 28 minutes. 

480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes

The final answer is: 452"
"So, Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cups. Now, we gotta find out how many spoons he has. We do that by doin' 2/3 of 24. 

To do that, we multiply 2 by 24, then divide by 3. That's 48 divided by 3, which is 16. So, Jonathan has 16 spoons.

Then, he gives 6 spoons to Pedro. To find out how many spoons he has left, we subtract 6 from 16. That's 16 minus 6, which is 10.

Jonathan has 24 cups and 10 spoons, so he has a total of 24 + 10 = 34 utensils.

The final answer is 34."
"So, there's this hospital with 1000 beds. It's already half full, which means 500 beds are taken. Now, 50 new people are comin' in every day. We wanna know how many beds are left after 2 weeks.

Two weeks is 14 days, so 50 * 14 = 700 people will be comin' in. That means 700 more beds will be taken. 

So, we gotta subtract 700 from 500 to find out how many beds are left. 500 - 700 is -200, but that can't be right. We can't have negative beds. I think I made a mistake. Let me try again.

If 500 beds are taken and 700 more are comin' in, that's a total of 500 + 700 = 1200 beds. But the hospital only has 1000 beds. So, we gotta subtract 1000 from 1200. That's 200 beds taken. 

Now, we subtract 200 from 500. That's 500 - 200 = 300 beds left.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, Robyn sends 16 emails a day. She sends 7 of those to work. That means she sends 16 - 7 = 9 emails that ain't work.

Now, she sends 2/3 of those 9 emails to her family. That's 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The thing is, the other 3 emails that ain't to her family are to her boyfriend. And since 1/3 of those 3 emails are to her boyfriend, that's 1/3 * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend.

So, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend a day.

The final answer is 1."
"So, there's this girl named Aliya, and she's 3 years old. Her cousin Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. That means Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's dad is five times as old as Shawna. So, we gotta multiply Shawna's age by 5. That's 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The answer is 45."
"So, there's this lady Courtney, she said there were 48 people at the concert. But then this other lady Kelly comes along and says Courtney made a mistake, and she said it was 20% more than the real number. 

To figure out the real number, we gotta find 20% of 48. That's like, 48 * 0.20 = 9.6. Now, we gotta subtract that from 48. So, 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

So, the real number of people who went to the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"So, there's this coach and he's got a bag of basketballs. He dumps 'em all out on the floor, and then he asks these three boys, Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, to pick 'em up and carry 'em to the bag. They do it in one trip, and it's pretty cool.

Now, the thing is, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. And Jason carried 2 balls. So, we gotta figure out how many balls Jeffrey carried.

If Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey, that means Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Then, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we gotta add up all the balls they carried to find out how many the coach brought. So, it's 4 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.

The final answer is 7."
"So, there's this pirate crew diggin' for treasure on an island. They dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 6 holes the third day 'cause they filled in 2 of 'em. Then, on the fourth day, they found a treasure chest. The island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. 

Let's figure out how many holes they dug on the fourth day. We know they dug 10 holes the first day, 13 the second, and 6 the third. So, the total holes by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. 

Now, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so we multiply 29 by 4 to get 116 holes. Since they found the treasure on the fourth day, we subtract 29 from 116 to find out how many holes they dug that day. That's 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is 87."
"So, there's this thing about corn chips. Three people, Amora, Lainey, and Collins, wanna share 'em. But then they figure out that only two of 'em can get an equal amount, and the other one gets 15 more. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. 

Now, Collins got 15 more than the other two, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Let's add up all the corn chips: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The answer is 225."
"So, Jen's gotta pay for some stuff to travel to 3 different countries. He's gotta pay $400 for that stuff. Now, the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the stuff he's payin' for. That means he's gotta pay 50% more than $400.

50% of $400 is $200. So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than $400. To find the cost of the travel tickets, we add $200 to $400.

$400 + $200 = $600

So, the travel tickets cost $600."
"So there's this thing about three guys, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, and they're tryin' to catch Pokémon. They caught a total of 339 Pokémon. Now, Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe caught.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught A Pokémon. Then Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokémon, and Alex caught 4A - 13 + 5 Pokémon. We can put all these together and set it equal to 339:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Simplifying this, we get:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan caught:
Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokémon, so:
4(40) - 13 = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"So, there's this show John's watchin', and each episode is 20 minutes long. And there's half as many episodes as there are minutes in an episode. That means if you take the minutes in an episode and divide it by 2, you get the number of episodes.

So, if an episode is 20 minutes, and you divide that by 2, you get 10 episodes. Then, you multiply the number of episodes by the length of the episode, which is 20 minutes. That's 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The answer is 200."
"So, there's this bird, right? She's tryin' to get to her winter home from her summer home. She flies south for a bit, then turns around and flies back north, and then flies south again. We gotta figure out how far apart her homes are.

First, she flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. That's like, 10 x 30 = 300 miles. She's 300 miles south of her summer home.

Then, she flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's like, 2 x 18 = 36 miles. She's now 300 - 36 = 264 miles south of her summer home.

Finally, she flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. That's like, 5 x 22 = 110 miles. She's now 264 - 110 = 154 miles south of her summer home.

So, the distance between her northern and southern homes is 154 miles.

The final answer is 154."
"So, Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen, that's 12 brownies. Then, her office threw her a party and sent her home with half a dozen, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends threw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies. 

Now, let's add all those brownies together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66. Then, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. 

To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we need to subtract the brownies eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the whole day.

The final answer is 48."
"So, there's this kid named Nani, he's 8 years old. His brother is twice as old as him, so his brother is 16 years old. 

Now, Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. That means she's 75% of his age. To find her age, I multiply 8 by 0.75, which is 6. So, Nani's sister is 6 years old.

To find the total age of the family, I add up their ages: 8 (Nani) + 16 (his brother) + 6 (his sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family is 30 years."
"So, there's this guy Andy, and he's got 12 tennis racquets that need stringin'. He's gonna string 3 of 'em with synthetic gut, 5 with polyester, and 4 with a mix of both. 

To figure out how long it's gonna take him, we gotta do some math. 

For the synthetic gut ones, it takes him 15 minutes each. So, 3 of 'em is 3 x 15 = 45 minutes. 

Then, for the polyester ones, it's 5 x 22 = 110 minutes. 

And for the hybrid ones, it's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes. 

Now, we add 'em all up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes. 

So, it's gonna take Andy 227 minutes to string all those racquets."
"So, John is buyin' new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife. Each phone after the first 2 is half price. The phone price is $600. 

First, we gotta find out how much the first 2 phones cost. That's 2 x $600, which is $1200.

Now, we gotta find out how much the other phones cost. There's 3 of 'em, and they're half price, so that's 3 x $300, which is $900.

So, the total cost is $1200 + $900, which is $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"So, there's this guy Zeke and he's got a baseball team. And then there's this other guy Carlton, and he's also got a baseball team. Now, I heard Carlton's team has 13 players. And I think Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, if Carlton's team has 13 players, that means Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we gotta add the number of players in both teams. So, we add 13 (Carlton's team) and 20 (Zeke's team). That's 13 + 20 = 33 players.

The answer is 33."
"So, there's this guy Robert, and he's buildin' a fence around his garden. The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fence. To find out how many slats he needs, we gotta figure out the whole perimeter of the fence. The perimeter is like the distance around the whole thing.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Now, since he needs 2 slats for every foot, we just multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

So, Robert needs 100 wood slats for his fence."
"So, Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's 4 boxes she gave away. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 of 12 boxes, that's 3 boxes. So, she kept 3 boxes of oranges.

Now, let's figure out how many oranges she had left. She had 12 boxes, gave away 4, and kept 3. That means she had 12 - 4 - 3 = 5 boxes left. Since each box has 20 oranges, she had 5 * 20 = 100 oranges left.

She gave away the rest, so she sold 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"So, there's this thing about India and the USA. They got states, right? And India's got more states than half of the states in the USA. Half of the states in the USA is 25. But India's got 4 more than that. So, India's got 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we gotta add the states together. The USA's got 50 states. We add 29 to that, and we get... 50 + 29 = 79.

So, the answer is 79."
"So, Tyler wants to buy some stuff. He's got a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a cookbook for kids that costs $8. He's got $14 saved up. He makes $5 an hour. 

First, we gotta add up how much all the stuff costs. $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. Then, we subtract the money he's got saved. $39 - $14 = $25. 

Now, we need to figure out how many hours he needs to work to make $25. We do that by dividing $25 by $5. $25 ÷ $5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"So there's this guy Richard, and he's gonna share some cherries with Jerry and Robert. Robert already has 30 cherries, and he's got 10 more than Richard. That means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, if they're gonna share 60 cherries in total, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, that means Jerry's gotta have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

So, Robert's got 30 cherries, and Jerry's got 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert's got than Jerry, we just subtract Jerry's from Robert's: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Sunny's sellin' gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. Then he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's see how much he made. Gingerbread costs $6 and apple pie costs $15. So, on Saturday, he made 10 * 6 = $60 from gingerbread and 6 * 15 = $90 from apple pie. That's a total of $60 + $90 = $150.

On Sunday, he made 15 * 6 = $90 from gingerbread and 6 * 15 = $90 from apple pie. That's a total of $90 + $90 = $180.

So, Sunny made $150 + $180 = $330 in two days.

The final answer is: $330"
"So, there's this lady named Pamela, and she's gonna be outside for a pretty long time. She's gonna be outside for 4 hours a day, and that's for 8 days. That's a lotta time!

So, let's see... if she's outside for 4 hours a day, and that's for 8 days, that's 4 x 8 = 32 hours. She's gonna need a lot of sunscreen, 'cause she's gonna reapply it every hour.

Now, her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. So, we gotta divide 32 hours by 8 ounces. That's 32 ÷ 8 = 4. She's gonna need 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The answer is 4."
"So, there's this blue car that costs $100. Now, I gotta figure out how much the red car costs. I heard it's 40% cheaper than the blue car. That means I gotta take 40% of $100 and subtract it from $100.

40% of $100 is like, um... *counts on fingers* ...40 bucks. Yeah, that's right. So, I subtract 40 from 100.

$100 - 40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60. And the blue car still costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"So, there's this guy Emil, and he's 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he's gonna be half the age of his dad, and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's figure this out. We know Emil's age now is 19. When he turns 24, he's gonna be half the age of his dad. So, we gotta find out how old his dad is. We can do that by multiplying 24 by 2, 'cause that's half of it. That makes his dad 48 years old.

Now, we know Emil's brother is half as old as Emil when he's 24. So, we gotta divide 24 by 2, and that makes his brother 12 years old.

So, we got Emil's age (19), his dad's age (48), and his brother's age (12). Now, we just add 'em up: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is 79."
"So, Adrianne's mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mom gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add 'em up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

The answer is 90."
"So, Joe caught some crawfish. He caught 3 pounds on Thursday. Then he caught 4 times that on Friday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of that, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add it all up: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. Since you can eat 3 pounds at a time, we gotta divide 21 by 3 to see how many servings he got. That's 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

The final answer is 7."
"So, there's this class with 30 students. 20% of 'em are football players. That's 6 students. Now, we gotta find out how many are left. That's 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we gotta find out how many of those 24 are cheerleaders or in the band. That's 25% of 24, which is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

So, we add those two numbers together: 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band) = 12 students. They're all leavin' early.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this fella Charlie and he's got boots that are way bigger than this girl Sophie's. Sophie's boots are a 5, and Charlie's boots are, like, five times bigger than hers. That's 5 x 5 = 25. 

Now, we gotta find the average size of their boots. We do that by addin' 'em together and dividin' by 2. So, 5 + 25 is 30, and 30 divided by 2 is 15.

The answer is 15."
"So, Pat has a flower bed that's 111 feet long. She wants to put flowers in it. Her flowers take up 12 inches of space, and she needs to leave 1.5 feet of space between 'em. That's 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches of space between flowers.

Now, we gotta convert the length of the bed to inches. That's 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches. Then we subtract the space between flowers: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

We divide the remaining space by the space each flower takes up: 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5. But we can't have half a flower, so we round down to 109 flowers.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers. Each flower costs $6, so she'll spend 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"So, there's this fella Edgar, and he eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, which means he eats 18 divided by 2, which is 9 pretzels a day. Now, we gotta figure out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. We do that by multiplying 9 pretzels by 7 days, which is 63 pretzels.

The answer is 63."
"So, Katherine has 5 hanging baskets. She wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. Petunias cost $3 each and sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

First, let's find out how much it costs to put 3 petunias in each basket. 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias. 15 petunias * $3 per petunia = $45.

Next, let's find out how much it costs to put 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket = 10 vines. 10 vines * $2.50 per vine = $25.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together. $45 + $25 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"So, Artemis and her dad got a big bag of dirt. They got 30 pounds of it. They got some flowers that need different amounts of dirt. Roses need 1 pound, carnations need 1.5 pounds, and sunflowers need 3 pounds. They planted 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, let's see how much dirt they used for the sunflowers and carnations. 4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds. 10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds. So, they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of dirt.

Now, let's see how much dirt they have left. They had 30 pounds and used 27 pounds. So, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since roses need 1 pound of dirt, they can plant 3 roses.

The answer is 3."
"So, there's this lady named Jessica. She gets $2,000 a month. She puts 25% of that money into a special shoe fund. That's like, a quarter of her money. A quarter of $2,000 is $500. She puts that $500 aside every month.

Now, we gotta figure out how many months are in a year. There's 12 months in a year. So, we multiply $500 by 12. That's $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide $6,000 by $1,000. That's $6,000 ÷ $1,000 = 6.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"So, there's this lady named Emily, and she can peel shrimp pretty fast. She peels 6 shrimp in a minute. She can also cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Now, we wanna know how long it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes her to peel 30 shrimp. Since she peels 6 shrimp in a minute, we divide 30 by 6, which is 5 minutes. That's how long it takes her to peel 30 shrimp.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to cook 30 shrimp. We know it takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp. 

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cook. That's 5 minutes to peel and 10 minutes to cook, so 5 + 10 = 15 minutes. That's how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp.

To find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 15 minutes by 3. That's 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

So, it'll take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**The final answer is 45.**"
"So, there's this air conditioner thingy. It cools the room 2 degrees an hour when it's on low, and 3 degrees an hour when it's on high. The room gets warmer by 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner's not workin'. 

First, the air conditioner's on low for 3 hours, so it cools the room 3 x 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it's on high for 4 hours, so it cools the room 4 x 3 = 12 degrees. That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Now, the room's not gettin' cooled no more, so it just gets warmer. It's been off for 2 hours, so it gets warmer by 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

So, the room's 18 degrees cooler than it was when the air conditioner was on, but then it got 4 degrees warmer. That means it's 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it was when the air conditioner was on.

The answer is 14."
"So, there's this comet thingy that goes around the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30 years old. Then, Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age at that time. We need to figure out how old Bill was when he first saw the comet.

Let's think about it... Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet. Bill was three times that, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet. That's a long time ago.

Now, we gotta figure out how many years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. Let's call that number x. Then, Bill saw the comet x + 75 years after his dad did. We know Bill was 90 years old when he saw it, so we can set up an equation: x + 75 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 15. That means 15 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. So, Bill's dad was 30 + 15 = 45 years old when he saw the comet.

Now, we know Bill was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet, which is 3 * 45 = 135 years old. But we don't need that. We just need to know how old Bill was when he first saw the comet. So, we subtract 75 years from 135: 135 - 75 = 60.

So, Bill was 60 years old when he first saw the comet.

The final answer is 60."
"So, Buford writes a lot of checks. He writes one check every month for the electric bill and the gas bill. That's two checks. Then, he writes two checks to the church. And, he writes four checks to the pest and lawn service, 'cause that's four times a year. 

So, let's count 'em up. Two checks for the electric and gas bills, and two for the church. That's four checks. And then four more for the pest and lawn service. That's eight checks. 

So, Buford writes eight checks a month. And there's 12 months in a year. So, he writes eight checks a month * 12 months a year = 96 checks a year.

The final answer is: 96"
"So, there's this airport with two planes. One of 'em goes to Greece, and the other one goes to Poland. The plane that goes to Greece, it goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. That means it goes to Greece for 66 flights. 

Now, the other plane goes to Poland, and it makes 44 trips. And we know that's half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane's remaining trips are split between France and Germany. We don't know how many trips to Germany, but we know it's the same amount as the trips to France. So, we can say the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 trips to France.

The answer is 22."
"So, there's this thing about three little wolves, right? They howl at the moon every night. One of 'em, Tobias, he howls for 20 seconds. Then there's Chikote, and he howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. And then there's Igneous, and he howls for as long as the other two combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

So, we gotta add 'em all up: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Now, we need to turn that into minutes. There's 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide 120 by 60, which is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him twice as much as his mom. That means his dad gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

So, Adam got $6 from his mom and $12 from his dad, which is $6 + $12 = $18. He needs $30 for the trousers. To find out how much he needs to save, we subtract $18 from $30.

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam needs to save $12."
"So, we got four kids playin' together, right? There's Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know Akbar's 3 years old and Alessandro's 4 years old. 

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is like, the total age divided by the number of kids, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. That means Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we gotta find Wilfred's age. We know the total age is 20, and we know Akbar's, Alessandro's, and Helene's ages. So, we subtract those from the total age: 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

So, Wilfred's age is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"So Walter's got some money for charity. He starts with $500 from his neighbors. Then he gets $1500 from the internet thingy. That's a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Now, his lawyer is gonna give him some more money. The lawyer is gonna give three times as much as everyone else gives. So, the lawyer is gonna give 3 * $2000 = $6000.

But then, his friend gives him $200. That means the total amount of money Walter has is $2000 - $200 = $1800.

So, the lawyer is gonna give 3 times that amount, which is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"So, there's this wedding thingy with 100 guests, and each guest brings 15 cookies. That's a lotta cookies, right? 

So, we gotta find out how many cookies they gave to the church. We do that by doin' half of the total cookies. That's 100 guests times 15 cookies, which is 1500 cookies. Half of that is 750 cookies.

Now, we gotta figure out how many people got those cookies. Since each person got 15 cookies, we divide 750 by 15. That's 50 people. 

The answer is 50."
"So, there's this family with 2 grown-ups and 4 kids. They wanna divide a watermelon. The grown-ups get bigger slices than the kids. Let's say the kids get x slices. Then the grown-ups get 2x slices.

We know there's 6 slices in total, so we can make an equation: x + 2x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So the kids get 2 slices and the grown-ups get 4 slices.

Now, we need to figure out how big each slice is. Let's say a kid's slice is y. Then a grown-up's slice is 2y. The whole watermelon is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

We wanna know what percentage of the watermelon the grown-ups get. They get 4 slices, so we divide that by the whole watermelon (10y) and multiply by 100: (4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%.

So, the grown-ups get 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, Doctor Jones is workin' at the clinic on Monday. He's gonna be there for 9 hours. He's gotta check on the sick folks, and that takes 20 minutes per person. He's got 9 people to check on, so that's 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. 

Then, he's got 10 appointments, and each one takes 30 minutes. That's 10 * 30 = 300 minutes. 

So, he's spendin' 180 + 300 = 480 minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 480 / 60 = 8 hours. 

Now, he's got 9 hours workin' and he's spendin' 8 hours, so he's got 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to do his paperwork."
"So, Jordan wanna make a cake for her mom's birthday. She gotta do a lot of stuff, like makin' the batter, bakin' it, lettin' it cool, and frostin' it. 

First, she gotta make the batter, which takes 20 minutes. Then she gotta bake it, which takes 30 minutes. After that, she gotta let it cool, which takes 2 hours. And lastly, she gotta frost it, which takes 10 minutes.

So, let's add all that up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 3 hours. 

Now, she wanna serve the cake at 5:00 pm. So, we gotta subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm. That's 2:00 pm. 

So, Jordan should start makin' the cake by 2:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"So, there's this thing about these two people, Lisa and Peter, and they're selling chocolate bars. They sold a bunch of 'em. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. We need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Let's say there's x chocolate bars in a box. Then, Lisa sold 3.5x chocolate bars, and Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 64. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8. That gives us x = 64 / 8.

x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The answer is: 8"
"So, there's this dance studio thingy. They got a studio that costs $25 to rent, and they charge $1.50 per student. They got 10 students, and they rent the studio 3 days a week. We need to figure out how much money they make in a month.

First, we gotta find out how much they pay to rent the studio. They rent it 3 days a week, so that's $25 * 3 = $75 a week. Since there's 4 weeks in a month, that's $75 * 4 = $300.

Now, let's see how much they make from the students. They charge $1.50 per student, and they got 10 students. That's $1.50 * 10 = $15 a week. Since they rent the studio 3 days a week, that's $15 * 3 = $45 a week. In a month, that's $45 * 4 = $180.

So, the total amount they pay is $300 (rent) + $180 (students) = $480. That's how much they pay. But we want to know how much they make, right? Well, they make the same amount they pay, 'cause they're not giving anything away for free. So, they make $480 in a month."
"So, there's this guy Peter and he got 4 boxes of chocolate bars. He got a total of 64 bars. We need to figure out how many bars he got in each box. To do that, we divide 64 by 4. That's 16 bars in each box.

Now, there's this other lady Martha. She got 7 boxes of chocolate bars and she got a total of 56 bars. We do the same thing, divide 56 by 7. That's 8 bars in each box.

So, we need to find out how many more bars Peter got in each box than Martha. We take the number of bars Peter got in each box, 16, and subtract the number of bars Martha got in each box, 8. That's 16 - 8 = 8.

The answer is 8."
"So, we got a bunch of porcupines in a park, and I think there's 50 of 'em. Now, we gotta figure out how many of 'em are the ladies. I think it's 3 out of 5, so we do 3/5 * 50, and that's 30 ladies.

Now, these ladies have babies. Each one has 4 babies, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 babies. We gotta add those to the original 50, so that's 50 + 120 = 170.

So, after a year, there's gonna be 170 porcupines in the park.

Final answer: 170"
"So, the Smith family needs to fill their pool. They gotta measure it first, then multiply the numbers. They got a pool that's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and depth. That's 14 x 25 x 4. 

14 x 25 = 350
350 x 4 = 1400

Now, they gotta multiply that by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water they need. 

1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons

The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply 8260 by 0.10.

8260 x 0.10 = 826

It's gonna cost the Smith family $826 to fill their pool.

The final answer is: $826"
"So, we got some sticks here. There's 9 red ones, and there's 5 more blue ones than red. That means there's 9 + 5 = 14 blue ones. And the yellow ones, they're 3 less than the blue ones, so that's 14 - 3 = 11 yellow ones.

So, we got 9 red, 14 blue, and 11 yellow. Let's add 'em up: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34. That's the total number of sticks."
"So, there's this guy Matteo, he drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. That's like, a long time, right? He drove 55 x 4 = 220 miles.

Then there's this other guy Shandy, he drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. That's even longer, 45 x 10 = 450 miles.

Now, we gotta figure out how much farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do that by subtractin' Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. So, 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"So, there's this school, Brook Hills High School. They got 3000 students. Half of 'em are older than 16, and one-fourth of those older ones are boys. The other half are younger than 16, and half of those are boys too.

So, let's see... Half of 3000 is 1500. That's the number of older students. One-fourth of 1500 is 375, so that's the number of boys older than 16. That leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls older than 16.

The other half of the students are younger than 16, which is also 1500. Half of those are boys, so that's 750 boys younger than 16. That leaves 1500 - 750 = 750 girls younger than 16.

So, the total number of girls is 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is 1875."
"So, there's this lady Bethany, she can run 10 laps in an hour. Then there's this other guy Trey, he can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so he can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Now, there's this girl Shaelyn, she can run half as many laps as Trey, so she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. And then there's this kid Quinn, he can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we gotta subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. That's 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there's this tank thingy that can hold 18000 gallons. Two ladies, Wanda and Ms. B, they wanna fill it up. They do it in two days. 

Day one, Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 4500 gallons. Ms. B fills 3/4 of what Wanda did, which is 3375 gallons. So, they filled 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons that day.

Day two, Wanda fills 2/3 of what she did the first day, which is 3000 gallons. Ms. B fills 1/3 of what she did the first day, which is 1125 gallons. So, they filled 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons that day.

They filled 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons in two days. To find out how much is left, we subtract 12000 from 18000. That's 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is 6000."
"So, there's this lady, Maria, and she's got a power bank. She's charging it before she goes to the park, but she unplugs it and it's not fully charged yet. When she's at the park, her friends ask to charge their phones, and while she's doing that, she notices the power bank is losing charge. 

First, the power bank loses 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours. That's like, 45% of the charge gone. So, after 5 hours, the charge is 100% - 45% = 55%. 

Then, for the next 3 hours, it loses 7% of its charge every hour. That's like, 21% of the charge gone. So, after 3 hours, the charge is 55% - 21% = 34%. 

Now, the charge remaining is 28%, and we need to figure out the initial charge. Let's set up an equation: 34% + x = 28%. 

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 34% from both sides of the equation: x = 28% - 34% = -6%. 

Wait, that can't be right. The charge can't be negative. So, let's think about this some more.

Wait, that can't be right. The charge can't be negative. 

Let's think about this some more. If the power bank loses 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's like, 45% of the charge gone. So, after 5 hours, the charge is 100% - 45% = 55%. 

Now, for the next 3 hours, it loses 7% of its charge every hour. That's like, 21% of the charge gone. So, after 3 hours, the charge is 55% - 21% = 34%.

"So, Janet gets a job as a waitress. She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips. She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. If she works 40 hours a week, how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?

To figure this out, we need to know how much she needs to save. 20% of $10,000 is $2,000. Now, we need to know how much she makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour and works 40 hours a week, so she makes $10 * 40 = $400 a week. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $400 = 5

So, Janet needs to work for 5 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 5"
"So Jamaar got $10 from mowin' lawns. He went to the store and bought some peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples. The peaches cost 50 cents each, pears cost 75 cents each, kiwis cost a dollar each, and plums cost 25 cents each.

He bought 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. So, let's see how much he spent on those:

3 peaches at 50 cents each is 3 x 0.50 = $1.50
4 pears at 75 cents each is 4 x 0.75 = $3
2 kiwis at a dollar each is 2 x 1 = $2
5 apples at 75 cents each is 5 x 0.75 = $3.75

He spent $1.50 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25. But he only had $10, so he's 25 cents short. He can't buy anything else.

So, he can't buy any plums.

Final answer: $0"
"So, Anne had a box of sweets. It had 15 packs in it, and each pack had 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she had 15 - 2 = 13 packs left. She gave those 13 packs to her 10 friends.

To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend got, we gotta divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends. So, we do 13 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 780 pieces. Then we divide that by 10 friends: 780 ÷ 10 = 78.

So, each friend got 78 pieces of sweets."
"So, there's this lady, Mrs. Tatiana, and she's got a store with carrots and stuff. The price of carrots goes up by 5% every year. It started at $120. 

First year, the price goes up by 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. So, the price is now $120 + $6 = $126.

Second year, it goes up by 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. Now the price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Third year, it goes up by 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. Now the price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"So, Olivia put 72 pictures on Facebook. She put the same number of pictures in 8 albums. There were 3 albums with just selfies and 2 albums with just portraits. 

To find out how many selfies and portraits she had, we gotta divide 72 by 8. That's 72 ÷ 8 = 9. So each album had 9 pictures.

Now, we know 3 albums were selfies, so we multiply 3 by 9 to find out how many selfies she had. That's 3 × 9 = 27.

And 2 albums were portraits, so we multiply 2 by 9 to find out how many portraits she had. That's 2 × 9 = 18.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits."
"So, James reads his book for a bit before bed. He reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, right? To figure out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we gotta do some math. 

We take the 10 minutes and divide it by 3 pages, that's 10 ÷ 3 = 3.33 minutes per page. Now, we multiply that by 18 pages, which is 3.33 * 18 = 60 minutes.

So, James reads for 60 minutes."
"So, there's this hotel and it's all booked up with 100 guests. Then, 24 of 'em leave early, and 15 leave late. That's 24 + 15 = 39 people who ain't there no more.

Then, in the afternoon, twice as many people come in as the ones who left late. That's 2 * 15 = 30 people. Now we got 39 + 30 = 69 people who left, but 30 came in, so we still got 69 - 30 = 39 people.

After dinner, 7 more people come in. So, we got 39 + 7 = 46 people.

The hotel now has 46 guests."
"So, John picks bananas on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. He picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks a lot more bananas, like, triple the ones he picked on Wednesday. That's 3 times 4, which is 12 bananas.

So, let's count 'em all up: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas. That's how many bananas John has."
"So, there's this quiz with 60 questions. I think 40% of 'em are easy, and the rest are split in half between easy and hard ones. That means there's 24 easy ones, 'cause 60 times 0.4 is 24.

So, there's 36 left, and we split those in half, so that's 18 easy and 18 hard ones. I'm pretty sure I can get 75% of the easy ones, which is 24 times 0.75, and that's 18.

I'm also pretty sure I can get half of the hard ones, which is 18 times 0.5, and that's 9.

So, I'm gonna add those two numbers together, 18 and 9, and that's 27.

The final answer is 27."
"So, there's this lady named Teresa, and she sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones. She sold twice as many small ones as big ones, and she made $120. The small ones cost $4 each.

Let's say the big ones cost x dollars. Then, the small ones cost 3x dollars. Since she sold twice as many small ones as big ones, she sold y big ones and 2y small ones.

The total amount she made is $120. The big ones made 3x * y dollars, and the small ones made 8y dollars (since they cost 3x dollars each). So, we can say:

3x * y + 8y = 120

We know that the big ones cost 3 times the price of the small ones, so 3x = 3 * 4 = 12. Now we can substitute 12 for 3x in the equation:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine the y's: 20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20: y = 6

So, she sold 6 big ones and 2 * 6 = 12 small ones.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this family, right? They got a man, a woman, and a kid. The man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the woman eats 4 sandwiches a day, and the kid eats 2 sandwiches a day. We need to figure out how many sandwiches they eat in a week.

Let's add up the sandwiches they eat per day: 5 (man) + 4 (woman) + 2 (kid) = 11 sandwiches a day.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 7, 'cause there's 7 days in a week. 11 * 7 = 77.

So, they eat 77 sandwiches in a week."
"So Suzanne sold some cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for a buck each, and 60 cupcakes for four bucks each. That's a lot of money. She gave her two sisters ten bucks each, and I think she's a nice person for doing that.

Let's see how much money she has left. First, we gotta add up how much she made from the cookies and cupcakes. She made 80 bucks from the cookies and 240 bucks from the cupcakes. That's 80 + 240, which is 320 bucks.

Then, she gave her sisters 20 bucks. So, we gotta subtract 20 from 320. That's 320 - 20, which is 300 bucks.

So, Suzanne has 300 bucks left.

Final answer: $300"
"So, there's this Easter egg hunt thingy. They hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins, they found 30 eggs each. That's 60 eggs. Then, they got some friends to help. They found all the eggs except 10. That means the friends found 100 - 60 - 10 eggs.

Let's do the math: 100 - 60 = 40. Then, 40 - 10 = 30.

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"So, there's this dwarf fella, and he's got some pickaxes. He can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands. If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 24 pounds. And if he uses a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than that, which is 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds.

Now, there's 40 of these dwarves, and they're all using steel pickaxes. So, they can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day. There's 30 days in a month, so they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"So, there's this store that sells sandwiches in different packages. They got a small one with 2 sandwiches for $3, a medium one with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a big one with 8 sandwiches. The price for the big one is a mystery, but I think it's gotta be more than the other two 'cause it's bigger.

I figured out that the price per sandwich is the same for all three. So, if you take the small one, it's $3 for 2 sandwiches, that's $1.50 per sandwich. And the medium one is $6 for 4 sandwiches, that's also $1.50 per sandwich. That makes sense, right?

So, if the price per sandwich is $1.50, then the big one with 8 sandwiches would be $1.50 * 8 = $12. That's my answer.

The final answer is $12."
"So, Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. Then, he has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. 

To figure out how much he has to pay per month, we gotta subtract the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom from the $3000 he spent on the bedroom set. That leaves him with $2000.

Now, we gotta find 10% of $2000. To do that, we multiply $2000 by 0.10. That's $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"So, Sally had some balloons. She had 25 red ones, 7 green ones, and 12 yellow ones. Then, some red ones popped. I don't know how many, but it was 40% of the red ones. That's 10 red ones. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red ones left.

Then, she let go of some yellow ones. Half of them, so 6 yellow ones. Now she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow ones left.

She found some blue ones in a tree. There were 8 of 'em. She took 75% of 'em, which is 6 blue ones. Now she's got 6 + 6 = 12 blue ones.

So, she's got 15 red ones, 6 yellow ones, and 12 blue ones. That's 15 + 6 + 12 = 33 balloons in total.

The final answer is 33."
"So, Marcus is thinkin' about doin' his homework. There's a 50% chance the teacher won't be there, and if the teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. And if nobody gets an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework and get one.

Let's think about it like this: 

If the teacher is there, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension (100% - 40% chance of gettin' one). And if she's not there, there's a 60% chance she won't be there (100% - 40% chance of bein' there). So, if the teacher is there, Marcus has a 60% chance of not gettin' an extension, and if she's not there, he's got a 60% chance of not gettin' an extension too.

Now, let's add up the chances: 60% (teacher's there, no extension) + 60% (teacher's not there, no extension) = 120%. But wait, that can't be right, 'cause probabilities can't be more than 100%. So, we gotta subtract the overlap. The chance the teacher is there and gives an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%. And the chance the teacher is there and doesn't give an extension is 50% * 60% = 30%. So, we gotta subtract those from 120%: 120% - 20% - 30% = 70%.

So, the chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 70%.

Final answer: 70%"
"So, there's this big place for 6000 people, and they're gonna have a graduation thingy. They gotta take out some seats for the graduates and the teachers, so they can't all go. 

They take out 950 seats for the graduates and 300 seats for the teachers. That's a total of 950 + 300 = 1250 seats taken. 

Now, we gotta find out how many seats are left. We take the total seats and subtract the ones taken: 6000 - 1250 = 4750.

There's 950 graduates, so we gotta divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates. That's 4750 ÷ 950 = 5.

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets."
"So, there's this fella, Grandpa, and he likes jelly beans. He can eat a lot of 'em. There's big ones, medium ones, and small ones. 

First, we gotta figure out how many big ones he can eat. It takes 75 big ones to fill him up. That's a lotta beans!

Then, he can eat twice as many medium ones as big ones. So, if he eats 75 big ones, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium ones.

Now, here's the tricky part. Eating 3 small ones is the same as eating 1 medium-sized one. So, if he eats 150 medium ones, that's like eating 150 x 3 = 450 small ones.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final answer is 450."
"So, Melissa gets paid $15 a day for doin' jury duty, but she's gotta pay $3 for parkin' each day. That means she's left with $15 - $3 = $12 a day. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

To figure out how much she makes per hour, we gotta divide her total pay by the number of hours she works. That's $12 ÷ 18 hours = $0.67 per hour.

The answer is: $0.67"
"Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books for $16 each and 3 pencils for $6 each. To find out how much he spent, we gotta add the cost of the books and pencils together.

First, let's find out how much the books cost. 3 books at $16 each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars. Then, 3 pencils at $6 each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add 'em together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent 66 dollars."
"So, Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet on his driveway. His driveway is 24 feet wide. To find out how many bottles he can fit, we gotta divide the width by 3.

24 feet ÷ 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Now, Richard's gotta move 7 times to get to the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply 7 moves by 5 seconds per move.

7 * 5 = 35

It's gonna take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is 35."
"So, there's this fella named Uncle Franky, and he got two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples, and he wants to put 8 apples in each pack. I think he can make 10 packs of apples."
"So, there's this lady named Amor, and she buys some cheese. She buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese, which costs $11 per pound, so that's 2 x $11 = $22. Then she buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese, which costs $6 per pound, so that's 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. She started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we gotta subtract $40 from $50. That's $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is $10."
"So, Jim goes to college to make more money. He takes 4 years to finish and gets $50,000 in loans each year. Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job. After college, his job pays $75,000 a year. 

First, we gotta figure out how much money Jim lost while he was in school. He got $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years, so that's $200,000. Then, he made $25,000 a year before college, and $75,000 a year after college. So, he made $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 more after college. 

Now, we gotta figure out how long it'll take Jim to make $250,000 ($200,000 he lost + $50,000 in loans). He makes $75,000 a year, so we divide $250,000 by $75,000. That's 3.33 years.

Final answer: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"So, there's this guy Jim, and he's makin' a comforter for his bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs fabric that's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we gotta multiply the length and width. That's 8 x 10, which is... 80 square feet. That's how much fabric Jim needs.

The final answer is: 80"
"So, the post office delivered some letters on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. On Monday, they delivered 425 letters. 

On Tuesday, they delivered more than one-fifth of what they delivered on Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 85, and they delivered 17 more than that, so they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204, and 5 more than that is 209 letters.

Now, let's add up all the letters: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

The answer is 736."
"So, Molly's sister is havin' a birthday party and she invited 16 people. There's 10 people who want the chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. That's 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Then, there's 6 people who want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person. That's 6 * $6 = $36.

So, the total amount Molly's gonna pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"So, Johnny's dad went to the horse racing thingy and he lost some money. He lost $5 in the first one. Then, he won some more than twice what he lost before, which is $5. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

Then, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second one, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find out how much he lost on average, we gotta divide the total amount lost by the number of races, which is 3. So, $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The answer is $7.17."
"So, there's this thing about South America, right? It's got 26 countries, and in each country, there's 5 cities. And in each city, there's 1000 people livin' there. I'm not really sure how I figured this out, but I think I did.

So, if you multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the population of each city, you get... um... 130,000. Yeah, that's it. 130,000 people. I think.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"So, there's this girl Ava and her friends Cole and Xavier. They grew taller over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. We need to figure out how much taller Cole is than Xavier now.

First, we gotta add the inches to Xavier's height. 4 feet is 48 inches, so 48 + 3 is 51 inches. That's Xavier's new height. Then we do the same for Cole, 50 + 2 is 52 inches. Now we need to find the difference between their heights. We do that by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height. 52 - 51 is 1.

The answer is 1."
"So, we got three people and they divided $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took. We need to figure out how much the first person got.

Let's say the first person took x dollars. Then the second person took x + 80 dollars, and the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount they took is $1920, so we can add up all their amounts and set it equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760 / 3
x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"So, there's this thing about painters workin' on a mansion. They work 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks. We gotta figure out how many hours they work each.

First, we gotta make 3/8 into hours. That's 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours a day. Then we multiply that by 7 days, 'cause they work 7 days a week. That's 9 hours * 7 days = 63 hours.

Now we gotta divide that by the number of painters, which is 4. So, 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter.

The answer is 15.75."
"So, there's this guy Rory, and he's pickin' up tennis balls after a match. He did it in three sets. The first set, he picked up more balls than the second set, and the third set, he picked up half as many as the second set. He picked up a total of 19 balls.

Let's say the second set was x balls. Then the first set was x + 4 balls, and the third set was x/2 balls. We add 'em all up and get 19. So we got x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To get rid of the fraction, we multiply the whole thing by 2, so we get 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 8 = 38. Subtractin' 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can figure out how many balls the first set was. It's x + 4, so that's 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"So, Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The price of the car goes down by 21% every year. 

First, we gotta find out how much the car goes down in 2008. 21% of $20,000 is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

Then, in 2009, the car goes down by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.

Lastly, in 2010, the car goes down by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

$9,876.27"
"So, there's this library with 50 books. Half of 'em are in English, and 10% are in German. The rest are in Spanish. I counted 'em out. Half of 50 is 25, so there's 25 English books. 10% of 50 is 5, so there's 5 German books. Now, I add those two numbers together, 25 + 5 = 30. That means there's 30 books that ain't Spanish. To find out how many Spanish books there are, I subtract 30 from 50. That's 50 - 30 = 20. So, there's 20 Spanish books."
"So, we gotta figure out how far Bernice still has to go. She drove 325 kilometers, and the whole trip is 1955 kilometers. To find out how far she still has to go, we gotta subtract 325 from 1955.

1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"So, there's this lady named Ingrid, and she drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to figure out how much water she drinks in 30 days. 

To do that, we gotta multiply 8 cups by 30 days. That's 8 * 30 = 240 cups. Now, we gotta know how many cups are in a gallon. I think it's 16 cups. So, we divide 240 cups by 16 cups/gallon. That's 240 ÷ 16 = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"So, there's this train with 120 people on it. Then, 20 more people get on at the first stop. That makes 120 + 20 = 140. 

Next, 50 people get off, and 100 more people get on. So, we gotta subtract 50 from 140 and add 100. That's 140 - 50 = 90, and then 90 + 100 = 190.

Then, 80 more people get off at the last stop. So, we gotta subtract 80 from 190. That's 190 - 80 = 110.

So, there's 110 people on the train at the end.

The final answer is 110."
"So, Alison went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She also got a package of $8 athletic socks, but she had a coupon for $2 off.

First, let's figure out how much the running shorts cost. Since it's $5 more than the tank top, we add $5 to the tank top price: $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they're on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

Now, let's look at the socks. She had a $2 coupon, so we subtract that from the price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"So, you wanna know how much it's gonna cost to fix that kitchen floor of yours. 

First, we gotta figure out how many tiles you need. Since each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, that's 1 square foot. You got a 200 square foot floor, so you need 200 tiles.

Now, each tile costs $12. So, we multiply the number of tiles by the price per tile: 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

That's how much it's gonna cost to fix that floor."
"So, James gotta buy insurance 'cause he had an accident. The regular price is $120 a month. But now it's 60% more than that. We need to figure out what that means.

60% of $120 is like, um... *counts on fingers* ...$72. Yeah, that's right. So, we add that to the regular price: $120 + $72 = $192.

Now, James gotta pay that every month. So, we gotta multiply it by 12 to see how much he pays in a year. That's... *thinks for a moment* ...$192 x 12 = $2304.

The answer is: $2304"
"So, there's this fella named Greg, and he does laundry. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His washing machine can only do 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. So, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Now, we gotta figure out how many loads he does in a year. There's 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply 3 loads by 52 weeks. That's 3 * 52 = 156 loads per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"So, they watch 4 movies on Saturdays. On Sundays, they watch half that, which is 2 movies. That's 4 + 2 = 6 movies in one weekend. If they do that every weekend, that's 6 * 4 = 24 movies in 4 weeks."
"So, Leo had some stickers, right? Two years ago, he had 100 stickers. Then, last year, he got 50 more stickers. This year, he got twice as many stickers as last year, which is 2 x 50 = 100 stickers.

So, let's add 'em up: 100 (two years ago) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"So, Imma has 3 cats and she feeds 'em twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. We wanna know how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. 

To figure this out, we gotta divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams). 

720 ÷ 60 = 12

So, the cat food will last 12 days."
"So, there's this Becky, Jake, and Silvia, and they had 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. That means Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Now, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find out how many slices they ate in total, we add up all the slices: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The final answer is 31."
"So, there's this lady and a guy, they made a meal together. The lady's part took 18 minutes longer than the guy's part. They finished the meal in 98 minutes. How long did the lady's part take?

Let's say the guy's part took x minutes. Then the lady's part took x + 18 minutes. We know they took 98 minutes in total, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the guy's part took 40 minutes. The lady's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"So, there's this lady named Hannah, and she slips on a banana peel and breaks her arm. The doctor charges her for some stuff. 

First, there's the cast, which costs $200. Then, the doctor charges by the hour, and Hannah's visit was 30 minutes, so that's $300 divided by 2, which is $150. The doctor also gives her some pills, and each one costs $4, so that's $4 times 30, which is $120. Lastly, the doctor says she has to park for 2 hours, and that costs $6 per hour, so that's $6 times 2, which is $12.

Now, let's add all that up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"So, James gets 80 emails a day. But 20% of those don't need a response. That's like, 20 out of 80. To find 20% of 80, I think I need to multiply 80 by 0.2. That's 80 * 0.2 = 16. So, 16 emails don't need a response.

Now, I need to find out how many emails James responds to. That's the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails a day, and he works 5 days a week, I think he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a week.

The answer is 320."
"So, there's this thing called the Science Center, and it had field trips last week. They had 32 classes on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, twice as many classes came, which is 2 x 32 = 64. On Wednesday, three times as many came, which is 3 x 32 = 96. Then, 30 more classes came on Thursday, and 25 on Friday.

Let's add 'em up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247. So, 247 classes came to the Science Center last week."
"So, we gotta add up all the scores, right? 

100 + 100 + 100 = 300
300 + 80 = 380

Now, we gotta divide by the number of tests, which is 4.

380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score is 95."
"So, there's this glee club and they ordered 20 pizzas. They ate 70% of 'em. That's like, 14 pizzas. Then, the football team comes along and orders twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas. 

So, we gotta add up all the pizzas they ate, which is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas. They ordered a total of 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas. 

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the ones they ate from the total, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The answer is 14."
"So, Anthony's got a pizza parlor and he's sendin' out coupons. He's sendin' out 700 little coupons and twice as many big ones. I think he's sendin' out 1400 big ones.

Each little coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big one costs 15 cents. So, let's see how much it's gonna cost him.

Little coupons cost 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. Big coupons cost 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Add 'em together: 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

Now, we gotta convert that to dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

So, Anthony's gonna spend 245 dollars on postage."
"So, there's this guy Sidney, and he orders some meatball subs. He orders 7 of 'em, but then this other guy Mark comes along and eats 4 of 'em. Then Sidney orders 3 more. So, we gotta figure out how many meatballs are left.

First, we gotta know how many subs are left after Mark ate 4. That's 7 - 4 = 3 subs. Then, Sidney orders 3 more, so now he's got 3 + 3 = 6 subs.

Each sub has 4 meatballs, so we multiply 6 subs by 4 meatballs to get the total number of meatballs. That's 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

The answer is 24."
"So, Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks. Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser. But some trucks broke down. A quarter of the trucks broke down. That means 5 trucks broke down. 

If 5 trucks broke down, that means 20 - 5 = 15 trucks kept going. 

Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser. So, 15 trucks had 15 * 20 = 300 tons of fertiliser. 

That's how much fertiliser reached the farmers."
"So, Dennis needs a lot of butter for his croissants. He needs 6 dozen, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. That's 6 pounds of butter. 

The store is having a sale where if you buy one pound, you get half off. So, for 6 pounds, he'll pay for 3 pounds and get 3 pounds free. 

He'll pay for 3 pounds of butter, and each pound costs $4.00. So, 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"So, Kayla's havin' a birthday party at the movie theater. The theater costs $125 to rent, and it's $6 for each extra person. Kayla invited 25 of her friends, 7 from her dance class, and 13 family members. But 4 people said they can't come.

First, let's figure out how many people are comin' to the party. We gotta subtract the 4 people who can't come from the total number of people Kayla invited. 

25 friends + 7 from dance class + 13 family members = 45 people

But we gotta subtract the 4 people who can't come. So, 45 - 4 = 41 people are comin' to the party.

Now, we gotta figure out how many extra people are comin' to the party. We already know 20 people are comin', so we subtract that from the total number of people comin' to the party. 

41 people comin' - 20 people = 21 extra people

The theater costs $6 for each extra person. So, we multiply the number of extra people by $6. 

21 extra people * $6 = $126

Now, we add the cost of the theater ($125) to the cost of the extra people ($126). 

$125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"So, there's this lady Maggie and this lady Riza, and they both had some money. They each had $60. They spent some of their money, and now they're left with some. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. That's 15 dollars. Riza spent a third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. That's 20 dollars.

They spent a total of 15 + 20 = 35 dollars. They had 120 dollars in total. So, they have 120 - 35 = 85 dollars left.

The answer is 85."
"So, Mr. Robles buys a bunch of bananas for his three monkeys. He's got 315 bananas. Each day, the first monkey eats 10 bananas. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats. We know the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. Since there's 7 days in a week, that's 24 * 7 = 168 bananas. 

Mr. Robles had 315 bananas, so the third monkey eats the rest, which is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas. Now, we gotta divide that by 7 days. 147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"So, Teddy did a puzzle thingy. He did half of a big puzzle, and then he did another one. He finished the second one in like, an hour. 

He did half of the big one, which is 500 pieces, so that's 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. Then he did the other 500 pieces in an hour. So, we gotta add those two numbers together. 250 + 500 = 750. That's how many pieces he did in that hour."
"So, Jenny went to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. She bought 15 roses. 

First, let's figure out how much the roses cost. 15 roses * $2 each is $30. She also bought a dozen roses for $15, so that's $15. The total cost of the roses is $30 + $15 = $45.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is $25. She needs $45 for the roses, but she doesn't have enough money. She's short $20.

Now, let's see how many quarters she can get with $20. $20 / $0.25 (quarter) = 80 quarters.

So, Jenny can't buy the roses because she's short $20, but if she had enough money, she would have 80 quarters left.

The answer is: 80"
"So, Terry sells milkshakes for $5.50 each, and he sells 6 of 'em. That's 6 * 5.50 = 33 dollars. He also sells burger platters for 11 dollars each, and he sells 9 of 'em. That's 9 * 11 = 99 dollars. And he sells sodas for 1.50 dollars each, and he sells 20 of 'em. That's 20 * 1.50 = 30 dollars.

So, let's add all that up: 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 dollars.

The final answer is: $162"
"So, there's this guy Paul, and he's waitin' for a train. He don't know how long he gotta wait, but he knows he's gotta catch the fourth train. The first train comes in 10 minutes, and it's there for 20 minutes. That means it leaves in 20 minutes. Then the second train comes in 30 minutes after that, and it's there for half the time the first train was, which is 10 minutes. So, the second train leaves in 10 minutes after that, or 40 minutes after the first train left. The third train comes in an hour after the second train left, which is 60 minutes after the first train left. It leaves right after it gets there, so it leaves in 60 minutes after the first train left. The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third train left, which is 80 minutes after the first train left. 

So, Paul waits 10 minutes for the first train, 30 minutes for the second train, 60 minutes for the third train, and 80 minutes for the fourth train. That's a total of 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"So Melanie's mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches, and Melanie's been savin' 'em for 12 weeks. She saves 10 toothpicks each week. She's already got 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks in total. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we gotta subtract 120 from 200.

200 - 120 = 80

Now, we gotta figure out how many weeks it'll take her to save the rest. She saves 10 toothpicks a week. So we divide 80 by 10.

80 ÷ 10 = 8

It'll take Melanie 8 more weeks to save the rest of the toothpicks.

The answer is 8."
"So, there's this watch that was originally worth some money. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of that money, and then he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he bought it for. We need to figure out how much money Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then find out how much he saved.

First, we need to find out how much money the watch was originally worth. We can do that by dividing the price Mr. Rogers paid ($2000) by 0.75 (which is 75%).

$2000 / 0.75 = $2666.67

Now, we know the watch was originally worth $2666.67. Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for 120% of what he bought it for, so we multiply $2666.67 by 1.20.

$2666.67 * 1.20 = $3200

Now, we need to find out how much Mr. Rogers' friend saved. We can do that by subtracting the price he paid ($3200) from the original price ($2666.67).

$2666.67 - $3200 = -$533.33

Since we can't have a negative amount, we need to figure out the percentage he saved. We can do that by dividing the amount he saved ($533.33) by the original price ($2666.67), and then multiplying by 100.

($533.33 / $2666.67) * 100 = 20%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend paid 20% more than the original price.

Final answer: 20"
"So, we got this thing about springs makin' jellyfish. They make one jellyfish every second, right? That's like, 60 jellyfish in an hour, 'cause there's 60 seconds in an hour. 

Now, if we got 5 springs doin' the same thing, we just multiply the number of jellyfish they make in an hour by 5. That's 60 jellyfish per hour * 5 = 300 jellyfish per hour. 

If we do that for 4 hours, we just multiply that by 4. So, 300 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours = 1200 jellyfish. 

So, 5 springs makin' jellyfish for 4 hours would make 1200 jellyfish.

Final answer: 1200"
"So Frankie and Binkie went bowling together. Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. Binkie bowled a score of 90. 

To find Frankie's score, we gotta do this: 

First, we multiply Binkie's score by 2. That's 90 * 2 = 180. Then we add 15 to that. So, 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score is 195."
"So, James went to the store, but then he went back home 'cause he forgot somethin'. He lives 4 miles from the store. He walks 4 miles per hour.

First, he walks to the store, which is half the distance, so that's 2 miles. He walks 2 miles, and it takes him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour, which is 0.5 hours. That's how long it takes him to get to the store.

Then, he walks back home, which is another 2 miles. It takes him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour, which is another 0.5 hours. So, in total, it takes him 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour to get to the store and back home.

So, it took James 1 hour to get to the store and back home."
"So, there's this lady named Jenny, and she's buyin' bananas. They cost $0.80 each, or you can buy a bunch for $3.00. She buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. 

First, let's figure out how much she'd pay if she bought 'em individually. She's got 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas, so she's got 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. Now, 40 bananas cost 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's see how much she'd pay if she bought 'em in bunches. She's got 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so she'd pay 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of the individual bananas: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"So, there's this thing with Sam and Harry and a fence. They got 100 feet of it. They wanna split it, but Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet. They gotta add 'em up to 100 feet. So we do x + (x + 60) = 100. 

Simplifying that, we get 2x + 60 = 100. Then we subtract 60 from both sides, and we get 2x = 40. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20. That means Sam gets 20 feet. 

Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract 20 from 100. That's 100 - 20 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"So, there's this crocodile, and it grows 8 inches in 4 years. We need to figure out how much it'll grow in 13 years. 

To do that, we gotta divide the 8 inches by 4 years, and that's 2 inches per year. Now, we multiply that by 13 years, and that's 2 * 13 = 26 inches. So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"So, Marcel sells bikes, right? He's got three kinds: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. MTB bikes cost $500, BMX bikes are half that, and Trekking bikes cost $450. He sold 300 bikes in a month. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest were MTB bikes.

First, let's figure out how many Trekking bikes he sold. Half of 300 is 150. That's how many Trekking bikes.

Next, we gotta find out how many BMX bikes he sold. 15% of 300 is 45. That's how many BMX bikes.

Now, we gotta find out how many MTB bikes he sold. We subtract the other two kinds from 300. 150 (Trekking) + 45 (BMX) is 195. So, 300 - 195 is 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate how much money Marcel made from selling bikes. He made 150 * $450 from Trekking bikes, which is $67,500. He made 45 * $250 from BMX bikes, which is $11,250. And he made 105 * $500 from MTB bikes, which is $52,500.

Adding all that up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"So, there's this farmer and a truck, and they're both workin' together. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales every hour. They work for 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales. That's a lotta hay!

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales. That's a lot of hay for the truck to take away!

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we gotta subtract the number of bales the truck took from the number of bales the farmer made. So, 30 - 18 = 12. That means there's 12 bales left in the field.

The answer is 12."
"So, there's this guy John, and he's got a lot of classes. He's got 6 periods a day, but he's gotta take 2 extra ones. Each class is 40 minutes long, and he goes to school 5 days a week. Then, he spends some extra time on the weekends.

First, let's figure out how many minutes he spends in class. He's got 5 classes a day, and each one's 40 minutes, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 minutes a day. He does that for 5 days, so that's 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, he's gotta add some extra time on the weekends. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. That's 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes. So, he spends 62.5 minutes on the weekends.

Adding that to his regular class time, we get 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To turn that into hours, we divide by 60. 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"So, there's this bouncy ball, and it's on the third floor of a mall. Each floor is 24 feet high. The ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after each bounce. 

First, we gotta find out how high the ball goes after the first bounce. We do that by multiplying the height of the floor (24 feet) by 2/3. That's 24 x 2/3 = 16 feet. So, after the first bounce, the ball is 16 feet high.

Now, we gotta find out how high the ball goes after the second bounce. We do that by multiplying the height of the ball after the first bounce (16 feet) by 2/3. That's 16 x 2/3 = 10.67 feet. 

So, the ball goes 10.67 feet on its second bounce.

10.67"
"So, there's this lady Caroline and she got 4 kids. The first one's 6 feet tall. That's like, 72 inches. The second one's 2 inches taller than the first one, so that's 72 + 2 = 74 inches. The third one's 5 inches shorter than the second one, so that's 74 - 5 = 69 inches. And the fourth one's 3 inches taller than the third one, so that's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The answer is 72."
"So, there's this apple orchard and they sell apples in bags of 10. They sold a whole bunch of apples, like, 2000 apples. We need to figure out how much money they made from that.

To do that, we gotta divide the number of apples by 10, 'cause that's how many apples are in a bag. So, 2000 ÷ 10 = 200. That means they sold 200 bags.

Now, each bag costs $5, so we multiply 200 bags by $5. That's 200 * 5 = $1000.

So, the orchard made $1000 from selling those apples."
"So, there's this big T-Rex that eats half of a triceratops. Then, some velociraptors come and eat half of what's left. Finally, some Allosaurus chow down on the last bit. We're tryin' to figure out how much meat was on the triceratops to begin with.

Let's start with the Allosaurus. They ate 270 kilograms of meat. That means the velociraptors must've eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. If we call that amount ""x"", then the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

We know the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up an equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

Now, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since they ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must've eaten 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

So, the T-Rex ate 1080 kilograms, and that's half of what was on the triceratops. To find the total, we just add 1080 to 540 (the amount the velociraptors ate). That's 1080 + 540 = 1620.

The answer is 1620."
"So, we gotta paint a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, and the east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. I think we gotta find out how much paint we need and how much it's gonna cost.

First, let's find the area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8, so that's 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. We got two of 'em, so that's 80 x 2 = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8, so that's 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. We got two of 'em, so that's 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add 'em together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. That's the total area we gotta cover.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Paint costs $12 per gallon, so 12 x $12 = $144. That's how much it's gonna cost to paint the room.

The final answer is: $144"
"So, Ellen had 12 sodas and shook 3 of 'em. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so that left 2 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 of those, so now there's 1 shaken soda left. 

There's 1 shaken soda and 9 unshaken sodas left. If Ellen's friend comes, they gotta pick one. There's only 1 shaken soda, so if they pick that one, they'll get sprayed. 

So, the chance of Ellen's friend gettin' sprayed is 1 out of 10, which is 10%."
"So, there's these two trains, right? One's movin' one way, and the other's movin' the other way. One's goin' 60 miles an hour, and the other's goin' half that speed, which is 30 miles an hour.

So, if they're movin' for 3 hours, the first train's gonna cover a lot of ground, like 60 miles per hour times 3 hours is 180 miles. That's a lotta miles!

The second train's movin' slower, but it's still movin', so it's gonna cover 30 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 90 miles.

Now, since they're movin' in opposite directions, we gotta add the two distances together to figure out how far apart they are. So, 180 miles plus 90 miles is... 270 miles!

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"So, there's this guy Billy, and he's helpin' people with their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. That's like, 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

There's 31 days in March, but he takes 20% of those days off. 20% of 31 is like, 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. But you can't take a fraction of a day, so he's off for 6 days.

So, he's available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days. And he can help 6 people per day, so that's 25 * 6 = 150 people.

The final answer is 150."
"So, there's this thing about Mary and John gettin' married. They had a bunch of cars and buses parked outside the church. There were 20 cars and 12 buses. Each bus can hold 35 people, and each car can hold 3 people. 

To figure out how many people were inside the church, we gotta add up the people in the buses and the people in the cars. 

Number of people in buses = 12 * 35 = 420
Number of people in cars = 20 * 3 = 60

Now, add 'em together: 420 + 60 = 480

So, there were 480 people inside the church."
"So, there's this guy Jeff, and he's older than his sister Martha. She's 4 years younger than her boyfriend Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. 

To figure out Jeff's age, we gotta do some math. First, we know Mike is 24, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. So, we subtract 4 from 24 to find Martha's age. That's 24 - 4 = 20. 

Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age. That's 20 + 10 = 30. 

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"So, we got two waterslides here. One's 300 feet long and people go down it at 60 feet per minute. The other one's 240 feet long, but it's steeper, so people go down it at 80 feet per minute.

To figure out how long it takes to ride each one, we gotta divide the length by the speed. For the 300-foot slide, that's 300 feet / 60 feet per minute, which is 5 minutes. For the 240-foot slide, that's 240 feet / 80 feet per minute, which is 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the 300-foot slide compared to the 240-foot slide. We do that by subtracting the time for the 240-foot slide from the time for the 300-foot slide. That's 5 minutes - 3 minutes, which is 2 minutes.

So, the 300-foot slide takes 2 minutes longer than the 240-foot slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Bobby takes a 30 minute lunch and 2 15 minute breaks per day. That's a total of 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. We need to convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour. 

Since Bobby does this every day for 5 days, we multiply 1 hour by 5. That's 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there's this Amber, Micah, and Ahito, and they ran a bunch of miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Then there's this other guy, Micah, and he ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. That's like, 8 x 3.5, which is 28 miles.

Now, we gotta figure out how many miles Ahito ran. We know the total miles they ran is 52. We know Amber ran 8 and Micah ran 28. So, we subtract those from the total. That's 52 - 8 - 28, which is 16.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

**The final answer is 16.**"
"So, there's this lady named Sheila. She bought some stuff on her credit card, and then she returned one thing. Then she bought some more stuff, and we gotta figure out how much she owes now.

Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she returned a $15.00 item. So, she's now down to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she bought a frying pan for $20.00, but it was on sale for 20% off. That means she got 20% of $20.00 off, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. So the frying pan cost her $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought some towels for $30.00, but they were 10% off. That's 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. So the towels cost her $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of the stuff she bought: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. She already had $70.00, so now she owes $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"So, there's this jellyfish tank thingy with a bunch of jellyfish in it. A fifth of 'em are big, and a third of those big ones turn blue when they see some special light. The rest are small and stay blue. When that special light comes on, 6 jellyfish change color. We gotta figure out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish is x. That means there's x/5 big ones. A third of those turn blue, so that's x/15. The rest are small, which is 4x/5. We know 6 of 'em change color, so we can say x/15 = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

So, there's 90 jellyfish in the tank."
"So, there's this girl named Caroline and she's older than this other guy named Ben. Ben's older than this kid named Chris, who's 4 years old. 

We know Chris is 4, so we gotta figure out how old Ben is. Since Ben's older than Chris, he's gotta be 2 times older than Chris. That's 2 x 4 = 8. So Ben's 8 years old.

Now, Caroline's older than Ben, so she's gotta be 3 times older than Ben. That's 3 x 8 = 24. So Caroline's 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"So, Lauren is savin' 20% of her paycheck. That means she's keepin' 20% and spendin' 80%. She's spendin' 40% of her paycheck, which is $40,000. That means she's keepin' $60,000.

Now, we need to figure out how much she's keepin' each year. We can do that by subtractin' the amount she's spendin' from her paycheck.

$100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000

So, she's keepin' $60,000 each year.

We want to know how many years she needs to work to save for 20 years. Since she's keepin' $60,000 each year, we can divide the amount she needs to save by the amount she's keepin' each year.

$400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years

Since you can't work a fraction of a year, we round down to 6 years.

The answer is 6."
"So, we got this ribbon thingy, right? It's 100 centimeters long. We gotta cut it into 4 equal parts. Then, we gotta cut each of those parts into 5 equal parts. 

So, we gotta divide 100 by 4. That's 25. Now we gotta divide 25 by 5. That's 5. So, each part will be 5 centimeters long.

The answer is 5."
"So, we got a question here. It's about a school. They got 240 boys, and that's 40% of the whole school. We need to figure out how many kids are in the whole school.

Let's think about it. If 40% is 240, then the other 60% must be the girls. We can find the total number of kids by dividing 240 by 0.4 (that's 40% as a decimal). 

240 ÷ 0.4 = 600

So, the whole school has 600 kids. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of kids.

600 - 240 = 360

There you go! The school has 360 girls.

The final answer is: 360"
"So, my mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. 

To figure out how much she spent, we gotta add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount. 

Cost of pots: $19
Cost of soil: $26
Total cost: $19 + $26 = $45
Discount: $7
Total amount spent: $45 - $7 = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"So, there's this party with some ladies wearin' heels. Three of 'em got 4-inch heels, and three got 2-inch heels. We gotta figure out the average height of all them heels.

First, we gotta add up the heights. Three 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. Three 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches. So, the total height is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Now, we gotta divide that by the number of ladies, which is 6. So, 18 ÷ 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of them heels is 3 inches."
"So, there's this lady named Soledad. She's got a job in a windowless office, but she loves bein' outside. She's gonna be on vacation for the whole month of June, and she's super excited to hike a lot of miles. She wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, and she's thinkin' about doin' it twice a day, coverin' 125 miles each time.

So, we gotta figure out how many miles she needs to hike per day. There's 30 days in June, so we gotta divide 9,300 by 30. That's 310 miles per day. But she's already plannin' on hikin' 125 miles a day, so we gotta subtract that from 310.

310 - 125 = 185

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to finish her trip on time.

The answer is: 185"
"So, there's this store with some balls. They got 3 red ones, 11 blue ones, and 25 green ones. The red ones cost $9 each, the blue ones cost $5 each, and the green ones cost $3 each.

Let's see how much money they'll get if they sell all the balls. 

First, we gotta multiply the number of each color by the price. So, for the red ones: 3 * 9 = 27. For the blue ones: 11 * 5 = 55. And for the green ones: 25 * 3 = 75.

Now, we add 'em all together: 27 + 55 + 75 = 157.

So, the store will get $157 if they sell all the balls."
"So, there's this Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, and they got some apples. They had 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants 1/3 of that. 

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 divided by 4, which is 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 divided by 3, which is 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul took 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples. That means Jacques is left with 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples.

The answer is 5."
"So, the temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. Then it went down 8 degrees Celsius, and then it went up 3 degrees Celsius. To find the temperature in the morning, I just add the numbers.

2 (initial) - 8 (went down) = -6
-6 + 3 (went up) = -3

So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

Final answer: -3"
"So, Raymond had some money, like, um, $21. Then he got some more, $11, from his allowance. That's good, 'cause he spent some on a comic book, $5, and a puzzle, $19. Now, let's see... 

He had $21, then $11 more, so that's $21 + $11 = $32. Then he spent $5, so that's $32 - $5 = $27. And then he spent $19, so $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left."
"So, Anna's got a budget of $16, and she's already spent $4. That means she's got $16 - $4 = $12 left. But then she's got $2 left, so she must've spent $12 - $2 = $10 on them books.

Now, she bought 2 books, and they cost the same, so we gotta divide $10 by 2. That's $10 ÷ 2 = $5. So, each book cost $5.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there's this calligraphy class and last year they had 50 students. Then, they had more students this year. I think it's 20% more. That means I gotta find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 is like, um... 10. Yeah, that's right. So, I add 10 to 50. That's 60. Now they got 60 students.

The answer is 60."
"So, there's this lighthouse with a light that blinks a lot. It blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to figure out how long it takes for it to blink 459 times.

To do that, we gotta find out how long it takes for it to blink once. We can do that by dividing 5 minutes by 255 blinks. That's 5 ÷ 255 = 0.0198 minutes per blink.

Now, we multiply that by 459 blinks to find the total time. That's 0.0198 × 459 = 9.05 minutes.

So, it'll take the light 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The answer is: 9.05"
"So, Tate's got a bunch of fish in his pond. There's 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfish, and 5 female goldfish. Then, he buys some more fish. He gets 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfish, and 3 female goldfish.

Let's count the fish now. There's 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies. There's 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies. There's 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfish. And there's 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfish.

Now, let's count all the fish. There's 6 male fish and 8 female fish. So, there's 8 - 6 = 2 more female fish than male fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, there's this lady Amalia, and she mows the lawn. She took 4 hours to do that. Then there's Megan, and she walks the dog. She took 2 hours more than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours. And then there's Dior, and she does laundry. She took 4 hours more than Amalia, so she took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time they took: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The answer is 18."
"So, John goes to his parents twice a month. He drives there and back, and it takes him 2 hours. He's goin' 70 miles per hour. To find out how far he's goin' in total, we gotta multiply the time by the speed. That's 2 hours * 70 miles per hour = 140 miles. Since he's goin' there and back, we gotta multiply that by 2. So, 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles. He's drivin' 280 miles in a month."
"So, there's this lady named Sofie, and she's gonna walk a lot in 7 days. She's gonna walk 10 miles a day. That's a lot, right? 

So, if she walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, she'll walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. That's a lot of walking!

Now, there's this other guy named Brian, and he's not as good at walking as Sofie. He walks half the distance that Sofie does. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that.

70 / 2 = 35 miles. That's how far Brian will walk in 7 days.

The answer is 35."
"So, there's this toy factory and they got an order for 400 toys. They got 5 workers, but 2 of 'em make 6 toys an hour, and 2 of 'em make 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, but they still need 20 more toys to ship the order.

First, let's see how many toys the first 4 workers made. The 2 that make 6 toys an hour made 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. The 2 that make 4 toys an hour made 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys. So, the first 4 workers made 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

They still need 20 more toys, so they need a total of 200 + 20 = 220 toys. Since 4 workers made 200 toys, the 5th worker must've made 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

The 5th worker worked for 10 hours, so we gotta divide 20 by 10 to see how many toys they make per hour. That's 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"So, there's this fella named Elijah and he got two dogs. One of 'em is a quarter the weight of this other fella's dog, and the other one is half the weight of that same dog. The other fella's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

So, the first dog Elijah got is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. The second dog is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we gotta add 'em up. 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The answer is 105."
"So, there's this guy Seth, and he gave half of his stickers to this other guy Luis. Then, Luis gave half of his stickers to this other guy Kris. And Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to this other guy Rob.

So, Kris had 9 stickers, and he got 7 from Rob, that means he had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. Then, Luis had 16 stickers, and he gave half of them to Kris, so Luis had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers. And Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"So, John buys 3 big bags of M&M's. Each bag is 10 ounces. And each ounce has 30 M&M's in it. We gotta figure out how many M&M's he got in total.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces. Then we multiply that by the number of M&M's in each ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's = 900 M&M's.

Now, John puts 10 M&M's in each little bag. To find out how many little bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's = 90 little bags.

The answer is 90."
"So, there's this bird, Alfie, and he flies 400 kilometers every day. The Earth is like, a big ball, and it's 40,000 kilometers around. We need to figure out how many days it'll take Alfie to fly half the way around the Earth.

Half of the Earth's distance is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers. Now, we gotta divide that by how far Alfie flies each day, which is 400 kilometers.

20,000 km / 400 km = 50 days

So, it'll take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the Earth.

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this lady named Rani, and she's really into sports cars. She's wonderin' what the fastest car ever made can go, so she looks it up. She finds out that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.

So, if the average car is 120, the 2nd fastest car is 5 times that, which is 5 * 120 = 600. Then, the fastest car is 1.25 times that, which is 1.25 * 600 = 750.

So, the fastest car can go 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"So, there's this guy Liam, and he's 16 now. Two years ago, he was twice as old as this other guy Vince. We need to figure out how old Vince is now.

Let's say Vince's age two years ago was x. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x. We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14. So, we can set up the equation: 2x = 14.

To find x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2. x = 7.

Now, we add 2 to x to find Vince's current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is 9."
"So, there's this thing about some people paintin' eggs. They painted a bunch, and we gotta figure out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold.

So, let's start with what we know. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. That means if Sarah painted x eggs, Camden painted x + 12 eggs. And since they painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Simplifying that, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtractin' 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 9. So Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call that number y. So, we can set up the equation y + y + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying that, we get 2y + 30 = 56. Subtractin' 30 from both sides, we get 2y = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 13. So Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we gotta figure out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. That's 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put 'em in boxes that hold 8 crayons each. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the crayons weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. There's 16 ounces in a pound, so the crayons weigh 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The boxes weigh the same as the crayons, 12.5 pounds. So, the total weight is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The answer is 25."
"So, there's this fella John, and he cuts down a big ol' tree. It's 80 feet long. He can make logs out of 80% of it, which is 64 feet. He cuts those logs into 4-foot pieces, so he gets 64 / 4 = 16 logs. Then, he cuts each log into 5 little pieces, so he's got 16 * 5 = 80 little pieces. He sells each one for $1.20, so he makes 80 * $1.20 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"So, Valerie gets $5000 a month. Her brother gets twice that, so he gets $10,000 a month. Their mom gets twice the amount of what they both get, so she gets $30,000 a month.

To find out how much money they all have together, we gotta add up their salaries. Valerie's $5000, her brother's $10,000, and their mom's $30,000. That's $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"So, grandma walks 3 miles every day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She walks on the beach for 40 minutes. We need to figure out how long it takes her to walk the whole 3 miles.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. We know she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Let's say she walks on the beach at a speed of x miles per minute. Then she walks on the sidewalk at 2x miles per minute.

We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. We can set up an equation to figure out her speed on the beach:

2 miles / x = 40 minutes

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

2 = 40x

Now, divide both sides by 40:

x = 2/40
x = 1/20
x = 0.05 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can figure out her speed on the sidewalk:

2x = 2 * 0.05
2x = 0.1 miles per minute

Now we know her speed on the sidewalk. We can figure out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute
Time = 10 minutes

Now we know it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know it takes her 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. So, the total time it takes her to walk 3 miles is:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Jane has been savin' $4 a week for 8 weeks. That's a total of $32. She wants to save $60. To find out how much more she needs, we gotta subtract $32 from $60.

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we gotta figure out how many weeks it'll take her to save the rest. She saves $4 a week, so we gotta divide $28 by $4.

$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it'll take her 7 more weeks to save $60.

Final answer: 7"
"So, we got 3 trees with 7 blue birds in 'em. That's 3 x 7, which is 21. Then we got 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4, which is 8. And then there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds. Now, let's add 'em all up: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The answer is 32."
"So, Bob has some marbles, and if he gets 2 dozen more, he'll have 60. That means he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before gettin' the extra ones. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he'll be left with 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"So, there's this guy Donny, and he can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He's got two mugs of water, one's 33 degrees, and the other's a mystery. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, and suddenly he can drink the water.

Let's say the other mug's temperature is x degrees. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the total amount of water he's got is 5 ounces. The 33-degree mug's got 4 ounces, so the other mug's got 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know the 33-degree mug's got 1 ounce of water, and the other mug's got 1 ounce too. The average temperature of the water's gotta be at least 40 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

Multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

So, the other mug's gotta be at least 47 degrees."
"So, Melanie's dad got an animal farm. He had 50 cows and 20 chickens. Then, some cows and chickens came. There's a company called Milkie Cows Limited that brings cows, and another one called Broilers Limited that brings chickens. They bring cows every day and chickens every day, for three weeks.

Three weeks is 21 days. They bring 20 cows and 10 chickens each day. So, we gotta add 20 cows and 10 chickens 21 times.

First, let's add the cows. 20 cows a day, 21 days, that's 20 * 21 = 420 cows. Now, add those to the 50 cows he already had. 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Next, let's add the chickens. 10 chickens a day, 21 days, that's 10 * 21 = 210 chickens. Now, add those to the 20 chickens he already had. 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

So, in total, he has 470 cows and 230 chickens. That's 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"So, Russell buys 4 packs of bagels. Each pack has 9 bagels. He gets a discount, and I think it's 10% off. That means he pays less than the total price of the 4 packs.

First, I gotta find out how much he pays for the 4 packs. That's 4 packs times $10 per pack, which is 4 x $10 = $40.

Now, I gotta find 10% of $40. That's 0.1 x $40 = $4. So, he gets $4 off.

I subtract $4 from $40 to find out how much he pays. That's $40 - $4 = $36.

Now, I gotta find out how much each bagel costs. There are 9 bagels in each pack, so I divide $36 by 9. That's $36 ÷ 9 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"So, there's this fella Gomer, and he ate some mashed potatoes. He ate 5 less than 23 scoops. That's like, 23 minus 5, which is 18 scoops.

Now, we gotta figure out how many potatoes he ate. See, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, we gotta find out how many scoops are in 18 scoops. That's easy, just divide by 2. 18 divided by 2 is 9 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes for 2 scoops, so we gotta multiply 9 scoops by 3 potatoes. That's 9 times 3, which is 27 potatoes.

The answer is 27."
"So, Chester eats eggs for 60 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days, and then he eats 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days. 

To find out how many eggs he eats in total, we gotta add the eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the eggs he eats in the next 30 days. 

First, let's do the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. 

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days. That's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs. 

Now, we add those two numbers together: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we gotta divide 240 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs he needs. 

240 / 12 = 20 

The answer is 20."
"So, Jess is tryin' to figure out how many blue jellybeans are in a jar. She sees 17 green ones and twice as many red ones. The rest are blue. There's a total of 60 jellybeans. 

First, we gotta find out how many red jellybeans there are. Since there's twice as many red ones as green ones, we multiply 17 by 2. That's 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we gotta find out how many blue jellybeans. We know there's 17 green ones and 34 red ones. We add 'em together and subtract that from the total number of jellybeans. That's 60. 

60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9

So, there's 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"So, Tim grows 5 trees. Each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. We gotta figure out how many lemons he gets in 10 years.

Let's see... 5 trees, 6 lemons per tree, that's 5 x 6 = 30 lemons per year. Now, we gotta multiply that by 10 years. That's 30 x 10 = 300 lemons.

The answer is 300."
"So, there's this bus with a bunch of people on it. The men and women are in a certain ratio, like 5 to 9. That means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We don't know how many men and women are on the bus, but we know the total number of people is 84.

To figure out how many men and women are on the bus, we need to find out how many groups of 14 (5 + 9) are in 84. We do that by dividing 84 by 14, which is 6. So, there are 6 groups of 14, and that means there are 6 men and 6 groups of 9 women, which is 54 women.

Now, 20 women get off the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from 54. That's 34 women left on the bus.

The final answer is: 34"
"So, Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets. He sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8 each. He made $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. 

He sells 12 sunflowers in a bouquet. If he made $56 from bouquets, that means he sold 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day. He did that for 3 days, so he sold 7 * 3 = 21 bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sold 21 * 12 = 252 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 252"
"So, Adam has $100 and he wants to buy rocks. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. He sells 60% of his rocks. 

First, let's figure out how many rocks he buys. He has $100 and each rock costs $5. So, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Then, he sells 60% of his rocks. 60% of 20 is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells these rocks for $7 each, so he makes 12 * 7 = $84.

He spent $100 to buy 20 rocks and made $84 from selling 12 rocks. To find out how much he lost, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent:
$100 - $84 = $16

So, Adam loses $16."
"So, there's this lady named Lauren, and she's a cartoonist. She can draw 5 big pictures, 6 medium pictures, or 7 small pictures a day. She's gotta make 45 big ones, 36 medium ones, and 49 small ones. 

To figure out how many days it'll take her, we gotta divide the number of each type of picture by how many she can draw in a day. 

For the big ones: 45 / 5 = 9 days
For the medium ones: 36 / 6 = 6 days
For the small ones: 49 / 7 = 7 days

The days don't match up, so we gotta find the biggest number, which is 9 days. That's how long it'll take her to finish the job.

The answer is 9."
"So, there's this lady, Chatty, and she got a bunch of eggs for her kids. She got three dozen eggs, which is like, 36 eggs. She's got four kids, and she wants to give 'em an equal number of eggs. To find out how many eggs each kid gets, we gotta divide the total number of eggs by the number of kids. 

So, we do 36 eggs divided by 4 kids, and that's 9 eggs per kid. That's the answer."
"So, there's this lady Jen, and she got 3 fish. They need food every day, and that food costs a buck. We gotta figure out how much she spends on food for her fish in May. May's got 31 days, so we multiply that by the cost of food per day.

31 days * $1 = $31

Now, she's got 3 fish, so we gotta multiply that by 3.

$31 * 3 = $93

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May."
"So, Patricia had 30 roses. Then she gave 24 to her mom. That means she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. After that, she bought 15 more roses. So, she had 6 + 15 = 21 roses now.

The answer is 21."
"So, there's this fella named Sid, and he's been drivin' around. He went 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he went another 140 miles in 3 hours. We wanna know how fast he was goin' on average.

First, we gotta add up all the miles he drove: 110 + 140 = 250 miles. Then we gotta add up all the hours he drove: 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Now, we gotta divide the miles by the hours to find the average speed. That's 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, Sid was drivin' at 50 miles per hour on average."
"So, there's this guy Mark, and he buys two lottery tickets. One of 'em's got a 20% chance of winnin', and the other one's three times more likely to win. That means the second one's got a 60% chance of winnin'.

Now, we wanna know what the chances are that both tickets win. To do that, we gotta multiply the chances of each ticket winnin'. So, we take 20% and 60%, and we multiply 'em together.

20% is the same as 0.2, and 60% is the same as 0.6. Multiply 'em together: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

Now, we need to turn that into a percentage. We do that by multiplyin' it by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the chances that both tickets win is 12%."
"So, there's this guy Carlos, and he's at the beach with Jim and Carrey. They're collectin' seashells, and Jim got 27 of 'em. That's 5 more than what Carlos got. So, Carlos musta got 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Now, Carlos got twice as many seashells as Carrey. That means Carrey got half of what Carlos got. So, Carrey got 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

They all got their seashells and divided 'em up. There's 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 seashells in total. If they divide 'em up, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

The final answer is 20."
"So, there's this fella named Mason, and he likes eatin' carrots. He eats 4 of 'em on weekdays, and 5 on the weekends. Weekdays is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And the weekend is Saturday and Sunday.

So, let's see... Mason eats 4 carrots a day for 5 days, that's 4 x 5 = 20 carrots. Then he eats 5 carrots on Saturday and Sunday, that's 5 x 2 = 10 carrots. Now, let's add 'em together: 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"So, John buys a cassette with 2 songs. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. We gotta figure out how long the second song is.

60% of 5 minutes is 3 minutes. So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. That means the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we gotta add the two songs together to get the total time. 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"So, Linus buys some phones, right? He buys 2 phones on Monday and 4 phones on Tuesday. He buys them for $20 each. 

First, we need to find out how much he spent in total. He bought 2 phones for $20 each, so that's 2 x $20 = $40. He also bought 4 phones for $20 each, so that's 4 x $20 = $80. The total he spent is $40 + $80 = $120.

Now, he sells the phones for twice the price he bought them for. So, he sells each phone for 2 x $20 = $40. He has 6 phones to sell, so he makes 6 x $40 = $240.

To find out how much he made, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made. So, $240 - $120 = $120.

The answer is: $120"
"So, there's this fella Carl, and he's got a cane. The cane is half as long as Carl is tall. Now, Carl's brother Ned is one foot taller than Carl. And Ned's cousin Isabel is two feet shorter than Ned. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, so we know that. Now, we gotta figure out how tall Carl is. Since Ned is one foot taller than Carl, Carl must be 5 feet tall. And since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the cane must be half of 5, which is 2.5 feet."
"So, there's this company called Hortex that makes juice bottles. They make 4200 bottles a day. Each bottle helps people get 20% of their energy. We need to figure out how many bottles they need to make to help 2300 people get all their energy.

First, we need to know how much energy 2300 people need. We do that by multiplying 2300 by 20% (which is the same as 0.2). That's 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles.

Now, we need to know how many more bottles Hortex needs to make. We do that by subtracting the number of bottles they already make (4200) from the number of bottles we need (460). That's 460 - 4200 = -3740. Wait, that can't be right. It means they already make more bottles than we need.

So, the answer is 0."
"So, Carla had 8 babies, and she dressed 3/4 of 'em in purple and 1/4 in blue. That means 6 babies are wearin' purple and 2 are wearin' blue.

Now, we gotta figure out how many of those babies are wearin' bows. We know 1/3 of the purple wearers and all the blue wearers are wearin' bows. So, 1/3 of 6 purple wearers is 2, and all 2 blue wearers are wearin' bows too. That makes a total of 4 babies wearin' bows.

We wanna know what the chances are that a baby wearin' a bow is wearin' purple. To do that, we gotta divide the number of purple bow wearers by the total number of bow wearers. That's 2 purple bow wearers out of 4 bow wearers. That's 2/4, which is 1/2, or 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"So, the IRS got a lot of tax reports last week. They got some on Monday and Tuesday, and some on Thursday and Friday. We know they got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 on Thursday and Friday. 

If we add those two numbers together, we get 4043. That's the total for those two days. Now, we need to find out how many they got on Wednesday. To do that, we need to subtract 4043 from the total number of reports they got last week, which is 5168.

5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS got 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"So, there's this guy Abraham, and he's got 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50. That's 40 square meters. Then, he sells another 1/4 of his land for $30. That's 20 square meters. He's left with 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he makes 20 * 3 = $60. 

He made $50 + $30 = $80 from the first two sales. Then, he made $60 from the last sale. So, in total, he made $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"So, there's this girl Haley, and she's 26 years old. Now, we gotta figure out how old Geb is. We know Geb is 10 years younger than half of Haley's age. Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13. Then, we subtract 10 from that, 'cause Geb is 10 years younger. So, 13 - 10 = 3. That's how old Geb is.

The final answer is 3."
"So, this guy Tyrion, he wears a face mask twice a day, and he goes out three times a day. That means he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks a day. Now, if we wanna know how many face masks he uses in two days, we just multiply that by 2. So, 6 * 2 = 12 face masks.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this fella Cole, and he hid some eggs in the yard. He hid 3 dozen eggs. That's like, 3 groups of 12 eggs. So, that's 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, there's this other fella, Lamar. He finds 5 eggs. Then, there's Stacy, and she finds twice as many as Lamar. That's 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Then, there's Charlie, and he finds 2 less than Stacy. That's 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. And then, there's Mei, and she finds half as many as Charlie. That's 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

So, let's add up all the eggs they found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are still hidden. We know there were 36 eggs to start with, and they found 27. So, we subtract: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The answer is 9."
"So, John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. Two of 'em got 200 apartments each, and the last one's bigger than the other two put together. It's 60% bigger, so we gotta figure out how many apartments that is. 

First, we gotta find out how many apartments the last one's got. We take the other two, 200 + 200, that's 400. Then we find 60% of that, which is 240. So the last one's got 400 + 240, which is 640 apartments.

Now we add 'em all up: 200 + 200 + 640, that's 1040 apartments. John collects garbage 3 times a week, so that's 1040 * 3, which is 3120 times. He gets paid 40 cents per collection, so we multiply 3120 by 0.40, which is 1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"So, there's this avocado tree thingy. It makes a lot of fruits, and I'm gonna tell you how many it makes in 10 years.

Year 1: It makes 50 fruits.
Year 2: It makes 3 times that, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
Year 3: It makes 7 times that, so 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits.
Year 4: It makes 7 times that, so 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits.
Year 5: It makes 7 times that, so 7 * 7350 = 51,150 fruits.
Year 6: It makes 7 times that, so 7 * 51,150 = 357,450 fruits.
Year 7: It makes 7 times that, so 7 * 357,450 = 2,490,150 fruits.
Year 8: It makes 10 times that, minus 200, so 10 * 2,490,150 - 200 = 2,490,050 fruits.
Year 9: It doesn't make any fruits.
Year 10: It makes 20 times the amount it made in year 1, so 20 * 50 = 1,000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits it made in the first 8 years: 50 + 150 + 1,050 + 7,350 + 51,150 + 357,450 + 2,490,150 + 2,490,050 = 2,526,700.

And then we add the 1,000 fruits it made in year 10: 2,526,700 + 1,000 = 2,527,700.

The final answer is: 2,527,700"
"So, there's this guy Jack, and he's got $100. Then, this lady Sophia gives him some of her money. She gives him 1/5 of her $100. I think 1/5 is like, half of 10, right? So, if she gives him half of 10, that's 5 dollars. 

So, Jack had $100 and got $5 more. Now he's got $100 + $5 = $105."
"So, we got three ropes here, and we need to figure out how long the red one is. The blue rope is shorter than the yellow one by 7 centimeters. Let's say the yellow rope is Y, then the blue rope is Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 times (Y - 7).

We know that all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long. So, we can write an equation: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37. Now, let's solve for Y.

First, we combine like terms: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37. That's 6Y - 35 = 37. Now, we add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72. Then, we divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5. And the red rope is 4 times the blue rope, so R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"So, there's this girl Ronnie and her sister Rissa. Ronnie got $5, and Rissa got three times that, which is $15. 

Then, they both gave some money to their little sister. Rissa gave 1/5 of her money, which is $3. So, she's left with $12.

Now, I'm thinkin', if Rissa gave $3 to her sister, that means Ronnie didn't give any money to her sister. So, Ronnie still has her $5.

The answer is $5."
"So, there's this wall with four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. They're all equal, so let's say each one is the same amount. We also know that half the wall is yellow, and the whole wall uses 12 pints of paint.

Since half the wall is yellow, that means the other half must be the other three colors. So, we gotta divide 12 pints by 2 to find out how much paint is used for the other half. That's 6 pints.

Now, we know that the three colors (red, white, and purple) use the same amount of paint, so we can call that amount 'x'. We can set up an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine the x's: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is 2."
"So, there's this guy Tom and he's got a house with 4 bedrooms. Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so we gotta multiply those numbers together to get the area of one bedroom. That's 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Now, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so we multiply 240 by 5 to get the area of the living room. That's 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. We add all these numbers together to get the total area of the house. So, 240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"So, there's this girl named Alice, and she's countin' clouds at school. She sees 3 clouds on Monday. Then, every day after that, she sees twice as many clouds as the day before. 

Let's see how many clouds she sees each day:

Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 2 * 3 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 clouds
Thursday: 2 * 12 = 24 clouds
Friday: 2 * 24 = 48 clouds

Now, let's add 'em all up: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds

The answer is 93."
"So, there's this big box of dishwasher pods that costs $12. But there's another box that's the same price, but it's got more pods in it. It's got 20% more pods than the other one. That means it's got 120 pods instead of 100.

Now, we wanna know how many times we can wash dishes with this new box for just $1. We use one pod per time, so we gotta divide $1 by the cost of one pod. The cost of one pod is $0.12. 

$1 ÷ $0.12 = 8.33

We can't wash dishes a fraction of a time, so we gotta round down to 8 times.

The answer is 8."
"So, Thomas takes out 1000 bucks in 20-dollar bills, that's 50 bills. Then he loses 10, so he's left with 40 bills. He uses half of those to pay a bill, which is 20 bills, so he's left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills. 

Then, he triples his money, so now he's got 20 * 3 = 60 bills. Finally, he puts all those bills into 5-dollar bills, so he's got 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this soccer game, right? Team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team A scores 1/4 of the goals Team B scored in the first half. Team B scored 2 goals, so Team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals.

Team B scores 4 times the goals they scored in the first half, so they score 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"So, the teacher got a 5-inch piece of chalk and he don't wanna waste it, so he only uses 20% of it each day. He used up 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 2.25 inches. He can't write with that small piece, so he recycled it.

Now, he's gonna use the rest of the chalk at 20% each day. We need to figure out how many days it'll take him to use it up. Let's say it's x days.

He used 2.25 inches on Monday, so the rest of the chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, so we can set up an equation:

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55

This is the amount of chalk he'll use each day. We want to find out how many days it'll take him to use up the rest of the chalk, so we can set up another equation:

0.20 * 2.75x = 0.55

Simplifying the equation:

0.55 = 0.55

This means that the chalk will last him 1 day.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, there's this class with 12 boys and 12 girls. Some of 'em are on the varsity team. We gotta figure out how many ain't.

First, we gotta find out how many girls are on the team. We take 1/3 of 12, which is 4. Then we do the same for the boys, 1/4 of 12, which is 3. So, in total, 4 girls and 3 boys are on the team.

Now, we add 'em up: 4 + 3 = 7. That's the number of kids on the team.

There's 12 girls and 12 boys, so that's 24 kids in total. We subtract the ones on the team: 24 - 7 = 17.

So, 17 kids ain't on the varsity team.

The final answer is: 17"
"So, Mike bought 5 face masks. Now, we gotta figure out how many Johnny bought. We gotta multiply 5 by 3, 'cause that's thrice as many. 5 * 3 = 15. Then we gotta add 2, 'cause Johnny bought 2 more than that. 15 + 2 = 17.

The answer is 17."
"So, James has 30 teeth. The dentist does two things to them: drills some and caps some. The dentist drills 4 of 'em. Then, the dentist caps 7 more than the number drilled. That means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

So, the dentist fixed 4 + 11 = 15 teeth. That's 15 out of 30. To find the percentage, we gotta divide 15 by 30 and multiply by 100. That's 15/30 * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk from the company. He had to throw away 2/5 of it 'cause it was bad. To find out how much milk he threw away, we gotta multiply 4000 by 2/5. 

2/5 is like, two parts out of five. So, we multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5. 

4000 * 2 = 8000
8000 / 5 = 1600

So, Mr. Marcellus threw away 1600 gallons of milk. The milk cost $3.50 per gallon. To find out how much he got back, we multiply 1600 by $3.50.

1600 * 3.50 = 5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back."
"So, there's this girl Wendy and her boy Colin. Wendy's age is five times as old as Colin's age in seven years. That means if we add 7 to Colin's age now, it's five times his age now. Let's call Colin's age now ""C"" and Wendy's age now ""W"". So, we can write an equation: W = 5(C + 7).

Now, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be as old as Wendy is now. That means if we add 25 to Colin's age now, it's equal to Wendy's age now. We can write another equation: C + 25 = W.

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: C + 25 = 5(C + 7). Now, we need to solve for C.

First, we'll multiply both sides by 1 (which doesn't change anything): C + 25 = 5C + 35.

Next, we'll subtract C from both sides: 25 = 4C + 35.

Then, we'll subtract 35 from both sides: -10 = 4C.

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 4: -10/4 = C.

-10/4 is -2.5. But you can't be half a year old, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Colin is 20 years old.

The final answer is 20."
"So, Bob has a lot of money to buy books. He's got $27,000 and he can buy 100 books for $500. That means he can buy 54 sets of 100 books with his money.

Now, he's got 3 schools to buy books for. To find out how many books each school can get, we gotta divide the 54 sets by 3.

54 ÷ 3 = 18

So, each school can get 18 sets of 100 books. That's 18 x 100 = 1800 books per school.

The answer is 1800."
"So, there's this fella named Newton. He finds 2 apples on the ground. He puts 1 in his pocket and throws the other one back up in the tree. That makes 5 more apples fall out. He puts 6 of those in his pocket and throws 1 back up in the tree, and that makes 6 more apples fall out. He picks up all the apples and takes them home.

So, he brought home 13 apples."
"So, Ali bought a lotta coal, 850 kilos, right? It comes in 50 kilo bags, and each bag costs 18 bucks. To find out how much it costs, we gotta divide the total weight by the weight of each bag. 

So, 850 kilos / 50 kilos = 17 bags. Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag. That's 17 bags * 18 bucks per bag. 

So, 17 * 18 = 306. Ali's coal order costs 306 bucks."
"So, we got a bunch of people comin' over and they're gonna eat a lot of pizza. There's 6 friends, and each one's gonna eat 10 slices. That's 6 x 10 = 60 slices. Now, we gotta figure out how many pizzas we need.

We got 2 kinds of pizzas: cheese and pepperoni. Cheese pizza's got 12 slices, and pepperoni pizza's got 8 slices. We need to see how many of each we need.

For the cheese pizza, we gotta divide 60 by 12. That's 60 ÷ 12 = 5. So we need 5 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, we gotta divide 60 by 8. That's 60 ÷ 8 = 7.5. But we can't buy half a pizza, so we need 8 pepperoni pizzas.

So, we need 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas. That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"So, Sam ran some miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He ran 3 miles on those days. Then he ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. To find out how many miles he ran in total, I just added the miles he ran on the three days and the miles he ran on the other two days.

So, 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles. Then I added 5 miles + 5 miles = 10 miles. Now I just add those two numbers together: 6 miles + 10 miles = 16 miles.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Jay is makin' snowballs for a fight with his sister. He can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 of 'em melt every 15 minutes. That's like, 4 times a hour. So, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, Jay makes 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs in an hour. Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes him to make 60 snowballs. 

60 / 12 = 5. That's how many hours it takes him to make 60 snowballs.

The answer is 5."
"So, there's this Digimon thingy, and it's been around for 20 years. There's this John guy, and he's twice as old as this other guy, Jim. John is 28 years old now. We need to figure out how old Jim is.

To do that, we gotta divide John's age by 2. That's 'cause John's twice as old as Jim. So, Jim's age is 28 divided by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
"So, there's this lady, Doxa, and she cuts an apple into 8 pieces. Then, her sister eats one more piece than Doxa, and her brother eats one more piece than her sister. 

Let's see... Doxa ate 1 piece. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 pieces.

Now, let's add 'em up: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 pieces.

The answer is 6."
"So, there's this thing about bandages. The nurses got some, used some, and then got more. They used 38 on the first day, and then they got 50 more. That means they had 50 - 38 = 12 left.

Then, on the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28. They still had 12 from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40.

On the third day, they got 100 more bandages (2 packs of 50) and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 left.

Now, they had 15 left at the end of the third day, and they had 78 at the end. So, they musta had 78 + 15 = 93 at the start.

The answer is 93."
"So, May's hair got cut and colored. She had to pay for the color, which costs $40. Then, she got her hair cut, and it was $30 for every inch. Her hair was 10 inches long at first and 8 inches long after the cut. 

To figure out how much she paid for the cut, we gotta find out how much her hair got cut. That's 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Since it costs $30 per inch, she paid 2 * $30 = $60 for the cut.

Now, we add the cost of the color and the cut. $40 for the color and $60 for the cut, so $40 + $60 = $100.

The answer is $100."
"So, Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. That's a lot of work! She gets paid $1.5 an hour. Plus, she gets $10 if she don't miss a single day. There's 4 weeks in April, so she works 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours. That's a lot of hours!

So, let's see... 180 hours * $1.5 = $270. And she gets $10 for every day she don't miss, so that's 4 * $10 = $40. Adding that to her hourly pay, she gets $270 + $40 = $310.

The final answer is: $310"
"So, Jason gets paid for doin' stuff. He gets $3.00 for doin' his laundry, $1.50 for cleanin' his room, $0.75 for takin' the trash out, and $0.50 for emptyin' the dishwasher. 

He did his laundry once, so that's $3.00. He took the trash out twice, so that's 2 x $0.75 = $1.50. He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50. And he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add it all up: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

The answer is: $8.00"
"So, there's this thing about whales and sharks. I think I remember my friend telling me that whales have 40 gallons of blood. And then there's this other thing about sharks having three times as much blood as whales. So, if a whale has 40 gallons, then a shark has 40 * 3 = 120 gallons. Now, we gotta figure out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply 120 by 10, and that's 1200 gallons."
"So, there's this fella Mr. Maxim, and he works at this restaurant. Some people come in, and some people go. 

First, 50 people come in. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people come in. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people. 

After that, twice as many people as the ones that came in at 10:00 come in. That's 2 * 40 = 80 people. So now we got 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Later, some more people come in. There's 3 times as many people as the ones that came in first. That's 3 * 40 = 120 people. So now we got 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that came in is 290."
"So, Alain's mom bought some pens. She bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so that's 5 x 5 = 25 red pens. Then, she bought twice as many black pens as red pens. That's 2 x 25 = 50 black pens. To find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, John buys 10 bottles of scotch. That's a pretty expensive stuff, right? He spends $600 on it. Now, he buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 20 bottles. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. That means it's $60 per bottle, 'cause 50% of $60 is $30, so it's $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

So, the total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles times $90, which is $1800. Now, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac together. That's $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"So, Mr. Julius planted some trees. He planted 20 of 'em White Oak ones. Then he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine ones as White Oak ones, which is 2 * 20 = 40. 

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak ones, so now he has 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak ones. He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine ones than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine ones.

Now, let's add 'em up: 30 White Oak ones + 50 Lodgepole Pine ones = 80 trees. But wait, I think I made a mistake. I forgot to count the 20 White Oak ones from the first day. So, it's 20 + 30 = 50 White Oak ones. And 40 + 50 = 90 Lodgepole Pine ones.

So, the total number of trees is 50 + 90 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"So, there's this fella named Fred, and he made 24 gallons of root beer. Then, his kids drank 4 gallons, and his wife spilled 7 gallons. After that, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons. Now, we gotta figure out how much root beer is left for the party.

First, let's see how much is left after the kids drank 4 gallons: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then, after the wife spilled 7 gallons, it's 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. Next, after Ronnie drank 5 gallons, it's 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. Finally, after 3 people drank the rest, it's 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

Now, we gotta divide the 5 gallons by 3 people. That's 5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"So, there's this thing about coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. I think it's like, if you got 8 more than 4 times the number of mugs, that's 40. We need to figure out how many mugs are there.

Let's say the number of mugs is x. Then, 4 times that number is 4x. And then we add 8, so it's 4x + 8. That's supposed to be equal to 40.

So, we set it up like this: 4x + 8 = 40. Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by subtracting 8 from both sides, which gives us 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides by 4, and that gives us x = 8. So, there's 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The answer is 8."
"So, there's this fish tank with 66 fish in it. I think one-third of 'em have red stripes. To find out how many, I just divide 66 by 3. That's 66 ÷ 3 = 22. So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, I gotta find out how many fish are left. I subtract 22 from 66, which is 66 - 22 = 44. That's the number of fish without red stripes.

Next, I need to find out how many of those 44 fish have blue stripes. I do that by multiplying 44 by 5 and then dividing by 11. That's 44 × 5 = 220, and then 220 ÷ 11 = 20. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, I just add 'em together: 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"So, Amy had some eyeshadow colors. She had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors. And she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors. So, in total, she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Then, her sister took one palette, and that had 4 colors. So, Amy had 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

After that, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. Now, she has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"So, there's this fella Mattison, and he's 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as tall as he is, so that's 7 * 60 = 420 inches. 

Now, the first floor is 3 times as tall as Mattison, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 inches. 

To find the height of the roof from the second floor, we gotta subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. That's 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The answer is 240 inches."
"So, there's this thing about 700 shells. Some people found 'em, and they divided into groups. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells. That's like, 40% of 700, which is 280 shells. 

Now, we gotta find out how many shells are left. We take 700 and subtract 280, which is 420. That's the number of shells left.

Then, there's this other group, The finders. They found 60% of the remaining shells. That's 60% of 420, which is 252 shells.

Lastly, we gotta find out how many shells the last group, Gogetters, found. We take the total number of shells, 700, and subtract the number of shells found by Alphas and The finders, 280 and 252, respectively. That's 700 - 280 - 252, which is 168.

The answer is 168."
"So, there's this guy Bernie and he's got 4 dogs. They all need to walk a certain amount of miles every day. The first one needs to walk 1 mile, the second one needs to walk 4 miles, and the third one needs to walk 3 miles. They all need to walk an average of 3 miles per day.

To figure out how many miles the last dog needs, we gotta add up all the miles the other dogs need and then divide by 4. So, we do 1 + 4 + 3 = 8. Then we divide that by 4, which is 8 / 4 = 2.

So, the last dog needs 2 miles per day."
"So, John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that's 40% of that. That's 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000. He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. That's 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he used from the loan amount. So, $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"So, Deandre caught 3 tunas. The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the last one weighs 26 kilograms. We gotta add 'em up to find the total weight. 

56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. Now, we gotta multiply that by the price of tuna, which is 50 cents. 

128 * 0.50 = 64. 

So, Deandre will earn 64 dollars."
"So, Trinity sells magazines for 11/8 of the price she bought 'em. She bought 'em for $72. To find out how much she's makin', we gotta figure out how much she's sellin' 'em for.

She's sellin' 'em for 11/8 of $72. That's like, 11 groups of 8 dollars. So, we multiply 72 by 11, then divide by 8.

72 * 11 = 792
792 ÷ 8 = 99

So, she's sellin' 'em for $99. Now, to find out how much profit she's makin', we subtract the cost from the sellin' price.

99 - 72 = 27

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"So, there's this thingy in Brian's basement that's supposed to make the air not so damp and stuff. It's got three speeds: low, medium, and high. I don't really know what those mean, but I'm gonna figure it out.

So, the low setting makes 1 liter of water disappear every day, and the medium setting makes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 liters. And the high setting makes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 4 liters. 

Brian used it for 3 days on the low setting, so that's 1 * 3 = 3 liters. Then he used it for 3 days on the medium setting, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 liters. And then he used it for 5 days on the high setting, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, I'm gonna add all those numbers together: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters. That's the total amount of water that thingy made disappear.

The final answer is 29."
"So, Jolene and her friends got 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. They had 12 balloons left. We need to figure out how many they threw.

Let's see... if they had 300 balloons in total, and 12 are left, we can subtract 12 from 300 to find out how many they threw.

300 - 12 = 288

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"So, there's this lady named Saanvi, and she's gotta mix two medicines together. She needs 14 milliliters of one medicine, and she needs 3 times that amount of the other medicine. That's 3 x 14, which is 42 milliliters. So, in total, she needs 14 + 42, which is 56 milliliters for one dose.

Now, we wanna know how many milliliters she needs for 8 doses. We multiply 56 by 8, and that's 448 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"So, there's this guy Ali, he's a dean at a private school, and he teaches one class. His class can hold 120 students. Then there's this other guy, John, he's a dean at a public school, and he teaches two classes. Each of John's classes can hold 1/8 of what Ali's class can hold. 

To find out how many students John's classes can hold, we gotta do 1/8 of 120. That's 15. Since John has two classes, we multiply that by 2, and we get 30. 

So, the total number of students that both schools can hold is 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150."
"So, Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and he's gonna pay her back with some extra money. He's gonna pay her $25 a month for 11 months, and then he's gonna pay the rest of the money, including the extra, in the 12th month.

First, we gotta figure out how much extra money he's gonna pay. That's 2% of $300. To find 2% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.02. That's $300 * 0.02 = $6.

Now, we add that to the $300 he borrowed. $300 + $6 = $306.

He's gonna pay $25 a month for 11 months. That's $25 * 11 = $275.

So, the amount he's gonna pay in the 12th month is the $306 he owes, minus the $275 he's already paid. That's $306 - $275 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"So, there's this guy Jordan, and he's got 2 kids, and they need diapers changed. Each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day. That's 2 kids * 5 changes = 10 changes. 

His wife helps out, and she changes half of 'em. Half of 10 is 5. So, Jordan's gotta change 5 diapers a day."
"So, there's this jar thingy, right? It's like, 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. And it's got jelly beans in it. We know how big each jelly bean is, which is 0.15 cubic inches. But we also know that the jelly beans don't pack all the way to the top, 'cause they're kinda squishy and stuff. So, we gotta figure out how many jelly beans fit in there.

First, we gotta find out how many jelly beans fit in the whole jar. We do that by multiplying the length, width, and height of the jar: 6 * 6 * 15 = 540. But we gotta remember that the jelly beans don't pack all the way to the top, so we gotta divide that by 0.8, which is like, 80% efficient or something. So, 540 / 0.8 = 675.

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we gotta multiply 675 by 0.3 to find out how many red jelly beans are in there: 675 * 0.3 = 202.5. But we can't have half a jelly bean, so we round down to 202.

The problem says the true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we gotta find out how far off our guess was. We do that by subtracting our guess from the true number: 900 - 202 = 698.

The final answer is: $\boxed{698}$"
"So, there's this bus, right? It can hold 200 people. It starts with 20 people on it. Then, 40 more people get on at the first stop. That makes 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Next, some more people get on at the second stop. It's 3/4 of the 40 people from the first stop. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. So now, there's 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

Then, at the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. That means there's now 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.

The thing is, the bus can only hold 200 people. So, we gotta figure out how many more people we need to get on to fill it up. That's 200 - 180 = 20 people.

The answer is 20."
"So, Pauline goes to the museum three times a year. She's been doin' that for 5 years, and then she keeps goin' for another 3 years. The cost of one visit is $2, but then it goes up by 150% after 5 years. That means the new cost is $2 + $2 * 1.5 = $3.

For the first 5 years, she spends 3 times a year, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 visits. That's 15 * $2 = $30.

For the next 3 years, she still goes 3 times a year, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 visits. That's 9 * $3 = $27.

So, the total amount she spent is $30 + $27 = $57.

The final answer is: $57"
"So, there's this school with 10 students in each grade, and they gotta earn points to try an escape room. The 10 students with the most points get to try it. There's only 8 spots, so they gotta make groups. They got 45 minutes to try and escape.

They can make 3 full groups with 8 students each, and then they gotta make one more group with 2 students. 

3 groups * 45 minutes = 135 minutes
And the last group takes 45 minutes too.

So, it's 135 + 45 = 180 minutes. That's how long it takes for everyone to try the escape room."
"So, there's this fella John, he's a carpenter, right? He made some stuff for his friend Ali. He made 4 tables, and each table costs $20. That's 4 x $20, which is $80. He also made 2 roof frames, and each one costs $10. That's 2 x $10, which is $20. So, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20, which is $100."
"So, there's this fella named Ian, and he's got a board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces, and one piece is supposed to be way longer than the other. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. We need to figure out how long the longer piece is.

Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long. Then, the longer piece is 4x feet long. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40. 

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 8. 

Now that we know the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4. That gives us 32 feet.

So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"So, there's this guy Aiden, and he's makin' meatballs for a cookout. He puts 2 tablespoons of his special seasoning on every pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from every pound. 

To figure out how much seasoning he needs, we gotta figure out how many pounds of meat he needs. We do that by dividin' the number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets per pound. That's 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound. 

80 / 16 = 5

So, he needs 5 pounds of meat. Now, we multiply that by the amount of seasoning he puts on every pound, which is 2 tablespoons. 

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his special seasoning."
"So, Luke is buyin' fabric for new curtains. He's got 5 windows, and each one is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric that's twice as wide as all the windows put together. 

To find out how much fabric he needs, we gotta multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. That's 5 * 35. 

5 * 35 = 175. Then, we multiply that by 2, 'cause he needs twice as much fabric. 

175 * 2 = 350. So, Luke needs 350 inches of fabric."
"So, you wanna know how much it costs to make a 36-minute call from a payphone. 

First, you gotta pay $0.25 for the first 16 minutes. That's 16 x $0.25 = $4.00. 

Then, after that, the price drops to $0.20 per minute. So, for the next 20 minutes, you pay 20 x $0.20 = $4.00.

Now, add those two amounts together: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The answer is: $8.00"
"So, it rained 2 inches on Monday. Then, it's gonna rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. Twice of Monday's total is 2 * 2 = 4. Then, we add 1 more inch, so it's 4 + 1 = 5.

The answer is 5."
"So, Carly's makin' cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. That means if she makes x cupcakes, she makes 3x - 2 brownies.

There's 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10. Now, we gotta figure out how many cupcakes she made.

Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2. We know the total number of treats is 10, so we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x - 2 = 10. Adding 2 to both sides, we get 4x = 12. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"So, there's this lady named Karen, and she wants to get a manicure and a pedicure. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. They give a discount if you get both, and that's 20% off. 

First, we gotta find out how much the discount is. That's 20% of $75, which is $15. So, the price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, Karen wants nail art on her fingers, and that costs $3 per nail. She's got 10 nails, so that's 10 * $3 = $30.

So, the total cost for Karen is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"So, there's this lady named Susan. She gets 3 magazines that come out 12 times a year. That's 3 x 12 = 36 times a year. Then she's got one magazine that comes out 6 times a year. And she's also got another one that comes out 4 times the amount of that one, so that's 4 x 6 = 24 times a year. 

Now, let's add 'em all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66. So, Susan gets 66 magazines a year."
"So, there's this lady named Samantha, and she's got 27 paintings. Now, she's got 12 fewer paintings than this other lady, Shelley. That means Shelley's got 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

And then there's this other lady, Kim. Shelley's got 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim's got 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

So, Kim's got 31 paintings."
"So, there's this toy that was $40 in November. Then, in December, it went up by 80%. That means we gotta add 80% of $40 to $40. 80% of $40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32. So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Then, in January, the price went down by 50%. We gotta subtract 50% of $72 from $72. 50% of $72 is 0.5 * 72 = 36. So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy is $36."
"So, there's this fella named Charlie, and he's a tennis pro. He teaches people how to play tennis. He charges $80 an hour for lessons, but if the person is a veteran, he charges less. I think it's 25% less. So, that's $80 - $20 = $60 an hour for veterans.

He teaches 4 people for $80 an hour, so that's 4 * $80 = $320. And he teaches 2 people for $60 an hour, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.

So, the total amount of money he makes is $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"So, we gotta add up all these numbers Sally got on her math quizzes. Let's see...

50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There's 9 numbers, so we gotta divide 630 by 9. That's 70.

The answer is 70."
"So Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. She gave some to her friend and was left with 1/4 of the pomelos. That means she had 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we gotta subtract the amount she had left from the original amount.

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"So, Walter bought 60 apples. He ate some and gave some to his sister. Then he sold the rest to his uncle. 

First, let's figure out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the apples. That's like, 2 out of 5 parts of 60 apples. So, he ate 24 apples.

Now, we gotta find out how many apples Walter had left. He had 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Then, he gave some to his sister. She got 25% of the remaining apples. That's like, 1/4 of 36 apples. So, she got 9 apples.

Now, we gotta find out how many apples Walter had left. He had 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Finally, he sold the apples to his uncle. He sold them for $3 each. So, he made 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"So, Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, that means she wrote 4 times as many novels this year. 

So, if 9 is 3 quarters, then 9 * 4 = 36."
"So, there's this guy Michael, and he's drivin' on the interstate. He's goin' pretty slow, like 50 kilometers per hour. He's doin' this for 3 whole days, and he's takin' breaks and stuff. 

So, we gotta figure out how far he's gone. There's 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 x 24 = 72 hours. Now, we multiply that by his speed, 50 kilometers per hour. That's 50 x 72 = 3600 kilometers.

Now, we gotta figure out what percentage of the whole trip he's done. The whole trip is 6000 kilometers. So, we divide 3600 by 6000, and then multiply by 100. That's 3600 / 6000 = 0.6, and then 0.6 x 100 = 60.

So, Michael's done 60% of the trip."
"So, there's this lady named Madeline, and she ate 6 grapes. Her brother, he wanted to make grape juice, and he used way more grapes than Madeline. He used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so that's 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

Then, their mom took the rest of the grapes and made 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many grapes they had at the start. We add the grapes Madeline and her brother used (30) to the grapes the mom used (48), and that's 30 + 48 = 78 grapes. But wait, we gotta remember that Madeline ate some grapes too, so we gotta add those back in. She ate 6 grapes, so we add those to 78, and that's 78 + 6 = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the start.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there's this school, Rydell Elementary, and they had 82 teachers. But 13 of 'em were out sick. Then, they got 9 substitute teachers to come in. To find out how many teachers were there, I just added the two numbers together.

13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 22

So, there were 22 teachers at the school that day."
"So, there's this fella named Bud, and he makes macaroni and cheese once a week. He spends a buck on pasta, and then he spends three bucks on cheddar cheese. He also spends twice as much on gruyere cheese, which is six bucks. So, let's add it all up:

$1 (pasta) + $3 (cheddar) + $6 (gruyere) = $10

Now, he does this once a week. There's 52 weeks in a year, so we gotta multiply $10 by 52:

$10 * 52 = $520

So, Bud spends $520 on macaroni and cheese in a year.

The final answer is: $520"
"So, there's this guy who's gotta clean 80 classrooms in 5 days. He takes 15 minutes to clean each one. He works 8 hours a day. 

First, we gotta find out how many minutes he spends cleaning. We do that by multiplying the number of classrooms by the time it takes to clean each one: 80 classrooms * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes. 

Now, we need to convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 1200 by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

He works 8 hours a day, so we divide the time spent cleaning by the time he works and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%.

So, the guy spends 25% of his day cleaning classrooms."
"So, Elly's got a bunch of books and she's tryin' to put 'em on some new bookcases her parents got her. Each of the middle two shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf. And the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.

Let's figure out how many books each shelf can hold. The middle shelf can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up how many books all the shelves can hold: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 books.

Elly's got 110 books, so we gotta divide that by the total number of books the shelves can hold. 110 / 45 = 2.44. Since you can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

The answer is 3."
"So, Rose bought a bunch of eggs, like, five dozen or somethin'. They cost her $2.40 a dozen. That's like, a lot of money, right? 

She's gonna sell 'em for $1 each, but only 3 eggs. So, that's like, a pretty good deal, I guess. 

First, let's figure out how much she paid for all them eggs. She bought five dozen, so that's 5 x $2.40, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...$12.

Now, let's see how many eggs she's got. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozen is... *counts on fingers again* ...60 eggs! That's a lotta eggs!

She's gonna sell 'em for $1 each, so that's 60 x $1, which is... *thinks for a sec* ...$60.

To figure out how much she made, we gotta subtract how much she paid from how much she got. So, $60 - $12 is... *thinks for a sec* ...$48.

So, Rose made $48 from sellin' them eggs. That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me!"
"So, Skyler has 100 hats. Half of 'em are red, which means 50 hats are red. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats. Now, 3/5 of those 50 hats are blue. To find out how many blue hats, I multiply 50 by 3 and divide by 5. That's 30 blue hats. Now, I subtract 30 from 50, and that leaves 20 hats. Those 20 hats are white.

The final answer is 20."
"So, there's this beef jerky that comes in bags. Each bag has 30 sticks in it, and it costs $18.00. But, they're having a sale, and it's $3.00 off. So, the price of the bag is now $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Now, we gotta figure out how much each stick costs. We got 30 sticks in a bag, so we divide the price by 30. That's $15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50.

To find out how much it costs in cents, we multiply by 100. That's $0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"So Audrey gotta take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She gotta get 70% of the questions right to move on to 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of 'em right. The second test has 40 questions.

First, let's figure out how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions right. That's 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions right.

Now, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total questions is 70 + 40 = 110. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions right.

She already got 42 questions right on the first test, so she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"So, there's this lady, Mary, and she's makin' ice cubes with fruit in 'em for a party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and then she makes a bunch of blueberry cubes. The thing is, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, minus 4. And she makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we gotta set up an equation. We can do that by addin' the number of strawberry cubes and the number of blueberry cubes and seein' what we get.

So, we got x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116. Now, let's combine like terms. We can do that by addin' x and 5x, which gives us 6x. Then we subtract 4. So, we got 6x - 4 = 116.

Now, let's add 4 to both sides of the equation. That gives us 6x = 120. Then, we divide both sides by 6. That gives us x = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes. We do that by multiplyin' 5 by 20, which gives us 100. Then we subtract 4. That gives us 96.

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: 96"
"So, there's this girl named Ara, and she joined a basketball team a long time ago. She plays 40 games every year, and she scores 21 points in each game. We need to figure out how many points she's scored in total over the past four years.

To do this, we multiply the number of games she plays per year (40) by the number of years (4), and then multiply that by the number of points she scores per game (21).

40 * 4 = 160
160 * 21 = 3360

So, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"So Brendan had 10 marbles, then he dropped half of 'em. That's 10 divided by 2, which is 5. He found 3 more, so now he's got 10 - 5 + 3, which is 8. Then he found a bead, but that's not a marble, so he threw it away. He still got 8 marbles.

The answer is 8."
"So, Jason needs to sell 15 cars. He knows that for every 25 phone calls, he gets 1 person to come in. And for every 2 people that come in, 1 car is sold. So, he needs to get 15 people to come in, and then 15 cars will be sold.

To get 15 people to come in, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 people. But he gets 1 person for every 25 phone calls. So, he needs 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls.

That's how many phone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars."
"So, there's this lady named Brianna, and her house went out one night. She and her family got all their candles and flashlights. They got a flashlight for each person, and two for each room. There's 8 rooms in the house, and 4 people, including Brianna. They got 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half.

First, let's figure out how many flashlights they got. They got 2 flashlights for each person, and there's 4 people. So, they got 2 x 4 = 8 flashlights.

Now, let's figure out how many candles they got. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles, and the other half have 5 medium candles. Half of 8 rooms is 4, so they got 4 small candles and 4 medium candles in each half. That's 4 x 4 = 16 small candles and 4 x 5 = 20 medium candles.

So, they got 8 flashlights and 16 small candles and 20 medium candles. Let's add 'em up: 8 + 16 + 20 = 44.

The answer is: 44"
"So, there's this guy Mitchell, and he's makin' nachos for his family. He buys two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. He's got five family members, and he wants to give 'em an equal share.

First, we gotta figure out how many chips he's got in total. We do that by multiplyin' the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag: 2 bags * 55 chips = 110 chips.

Now, we gotta divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. That's 110 chips ÷ 5 family members. 

110 ÷ 5 = 22

So, each family member gets 22 chips."
"So, there's this Rubik's cube thingy, and it takes John a while to solve it. He takes 5 minutes to get to the first side. Then, the second and third sides take twice as long, which is 10 minutes each. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, which is 2.5 minutes each.

So, let's add 'em up: 5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

The answer is 30."
"So, there's this guy Dominick, and he goes into the changing room and sees a bunch of stuff. He sees half as many robots as helmets, and half as many helmets as footballs. There's 20 helmets, so if there's half as many helmets as footballs, that means there's 40 footballs.

Now, if there's half as many robots as helmets, that means there's 10 robots. To find the total number of stuff, you just add 'em all up: 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs.

So, the total number of stuff is 70."
"So, Tim works 6 hours a day and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. We need to figure out how many calls he makes in a day. 

There's 60 minutes in an hour, and he works 6 hours a day. So, we gotta divide 60 by 15 to see how many calls he makes in an hour.

60 ÷ 15 = 4

Now, we know he makes 4 calls in an hour. He works 6 hours a day, so we multiply 4 by 6.

4 * 6 = 24

He makes 24 calls a day. He works 5 days a week, so we multiply 24 by 5.

24 * 5 = 120

So, Tim makes 120 calls in a week.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, Louise is tryin' to put varnish on some paintings. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry, and the new varnish takes 12 minutes. She's got 6 paintings to do. 

First, we gotta figure out how long it takes for the old varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. That's 7 minutes per painting, so 7 x 6 = 42 minutes. 

Then, we gotta figure out how long it takes for the new varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. That's 12 minutes per painting, so 12 x 6 = 72 minutes. 

Now, we gotta find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry. We do that by subtractin' the old varnish time from the new varnish time: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes. 

So, it's gonna take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry than the old varnish."
"So, Crista's got 20 plants, right? She's gotta water 'em every day. 

She's got 4 plants that need half a cup of water. That's 4 x 0.5, which is 2 cups. Then she's got 8 plants that need a whole cup of water, so that's 8 cups. And the rest, which is 20 - 4 - 8, is 8 plants. They need a quarter cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25, which is 2 cups.

Now, let's add it all up: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups. So, Crista needs 12 cups of water for her plants every day.

The final answer is 12."
"So, Phineas Frog got washed away from his home in the swamp. He's gotta hop and swim back. He's pretty fast on land, 20 yards per minute, and pretty fast in the water, 10 yards per minute. Half the distance is on land, and half is in the water. That means he's gotta do half the distance on land and half in the water.

So, the land part is 100 yards, and he's doin' that in 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes. The water part is also 100 yards, and he's doin' that in 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Add 'em together, and it's 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"So, Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. They come 8 to a box, and each box costs $2.00. To find out how many boxes he needs, we gotta divide 56 by 8.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes. Now, we multiply 7 by $2.00 to find the total cost.

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"So, there's this phone plan with five phones. The main phone is twice as expensive as the other phones. The main phone costs $20. 

We gotta figure out how much all the phones cost. The main phone is $20. The other four phones are half that price, 'cause they're twice as cheap. So, each one of 'em costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Now, we gotta add up the cost of all the phones. The main phone is $20. The other four phones are $10 each, so that's 4 x $10 = $40. 

So, the whole phone plan costs $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"So, Derrick has a bakery and he makes a lot of doughnuts. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. I think that's like, 10 groups of 12 doughnuts. So, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

There's 30 days in June, so he makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June. Now, I think he sells each doughnut for 2 dollars. So, he makes 3600 * 2 = 7200 dollars in June.

The final answer is: $7200"
"So, Jade took a lot of pictures, like, 210 of 'em. She wants to put 'em on Instagram, but she can only put 7 at a time. She does this every day. How many days is that gonna take?

To figure it out, we gotta divide the total number of pictures by the number of pictures she puts up each day. That's like, 210 ÷ 7.

210 ÷ 7 = 30

So, Jade's gonna need 30 days to get all her pictures up."
"So, Alicia's clothes gotta get dry cleaned every week. She's got 5 blouses, 2 pairs of pants, and 1 skirt. They charge her $5 for each blouse, $6 for the skirt, and $8 for each pair of pants.

Let's see how much she spends in a week. For the blouses, that's 5 * $5 = $25. For the pants, that's 2 * $8 = $16. And for the skirt, it's just $6.

Now, let's add 'em all up: $25 + $16 + $6 = $47. So, Alicia spends $47 every week on dry cleaning.

The answer is: $47"
"So, John likes to talk fast, right? He's got a normal talking speed, which is 150 words per minute. Then he trains and gets super fast, 2.5 times faster than before. That's 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

Now, he's got 10 pages to talk about, and each page has 450 words. So, he's gotta talk 10 * 450 = 4500 words. 

To find out how long it takes him, we divide the words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

So, it would take John 12 minutes to talk 10 pages.

The final answer is 12."
"So, there's this guy Conor, and he likes goin' to the beach. He found 50 people there on the first day. Then, the next day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people. The third day, there were twice as many people as the second day, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 people.

After that, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. That's 4 days, so 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is: 400"
"So, Garrett is makin' popcorn and stuff. He's got a pan of kernels and it's heatin' up. First, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds. Then, 3 times that amount, which is 60, pop in the next 30 seconds. After that, the kernels start poppin' faster, 4 times the amount of the first 30 seconds, which is 80, pop in the next 30 seconds. Then, the last 30 seconds, the poppin' slows down to half the amount of the last 30 seconds, which is 40.

So, let's add 'em up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels. Then, some of 'em pop from the heat after Garrett takes the pan off. A quarter of the last 30 seconds, which is 10, pop. So, we gotta add that to the total: 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is 210."
"So Tim wants to make lemonade for a pool party. He needs 1 cup of lemon juice for a gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons give him 1 cup of juice. He's gonna make 5 gallons of lemonade, and then he wants to make an extra gallon that's twice as sour. 

First, let's figure out how many lemons he needs for the 5 gallons. Since 6 lemons make 1 cup, and he needs 5 cups for 5 gallons, he'll need:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
6 lemons/cup * 5 cups = 30 lemons

Now, he wants to make an extra gallon that's twice as sour, so he'll need half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

So, he'll need 30 lemons for the 5 gallons and 12 lemons for the extra gallon. Let's add 'em together:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"So, we got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. They eat dog food, right? German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms a day, and Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms a day. We need to know how much they eat in a week.

First, let's add how much they eat in a day: 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms = 15 kilograms. Then, 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms = 6 kilograms. Now, add 'em together: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms a day.

Now, we need to know how many days in a week. That's 7 days. So, we multiply 21 kilograms by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

So, they need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"So, we got 10 animals that got 2 legs and 15 animals that got 4 legs. We need to find out how many pairs of legs we got in total.

First, we do the math for the 2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Then we do the math for the 4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs. Now we add 'em together: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Now we gotta divide by 2 to get the pairs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The answer is 40."
"So, there's this tower made out of blocks. It's got 4 blue blocks, and it's got twice as many yellow blocks. That means it's got 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many red blocks there are. We know the tower's got 32 blocks in total. So, we subtract the blue and yellow blocks from that. That's 32 - 4 - 8 = 20. 

So, there's 20 red blocks."
"So, Elvis is drivin' from his house, and he goes west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and goes east for 8 hours. He's drivin' at 18 miles per hour, right?

To figure out how far he's from his house, we gotta do some math. We multiply the speed by the time for each part of the trip. 

For the west part, that's 18 miles per hour times 5 hours, which is... 18 x 5 = 90 miles. 

Then, for the east part, that's 18 miles per hour times 8 hours, which is... 18 x 8 = 144 miles.

Now, we add those two numbers together to get the total distance. That's 90 + 144 = 234 miles.

But, since he went west and then east, we gotta figure out how far he is from his house. We do that by subtractin' the west distance from the east distance. That's 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: 54"
"So, Gary bought a boat for $9000. It went down in value a lot over the first year. It went down by 30%. That's 30% of $9000, which is $2700. So, the boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The next year, it went down another 30%. That's 30% of $6300, which is $1890. So, the boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

The last year, it went down 20%. That's 20% of $4410, which is $882. So, the boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The boat is worth $3528 after three years.

Final Answer: $3528"
"So, there's this big bag of Starbursts candies, and it's got 232 pieces. Now, I know it's got 54 red ones. And it's got twice as many orange ones as red ones, so that's 2 x 54 = 108 orange ones. And it's got half as many yellow ones as red ones, so that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow ones.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow ones: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. That's all the colors we got. To find out how many pink ones we got, we subtract that from the total: 232 - 189 = 43.

So, there's 43 pink ones in the bag."
"So, Helen went on a trip to Germany. She stayed in a hotel for 3 nights and took the bus 7 times. One night at the hotel cost $80, and each bus ride was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. 

To find out how much Helen paid, we gotta figure out how much she paid for the bus rides first. 10% of $80 is $8, and she took the bus 7 times, so that's $8 x 7 = $56.

The hotel cost $80 for 3 nights, so that's $80 x 3 = $240.

Adding the cost of the hotel and the bus rides, we get $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"So, Mazie gave some marbles to her twins, Dallas and Darla. Dallas had 21 marbles after throwin' 4 away. We need to figure out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we gotta find out how many marbles Dallas had before throwin' 4 away. We do that by addin' 4 back to 21, which is 25.

Now, we know Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins. We also know Dallas had 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Darla got, we subtract 25 from 52, which is 27.

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: 27"
"So, there's this family, right? They go to the movies. They got 2 grown-ups and a kid. The grown-ups cost $12 each, and the kid costs $8. They bought 2 big bags of popcorn, and each bag costs $3.

First, let's add up the cost of the grown-ups. 2 grown-ups is 2 x $12, which is $24. Then, we add the kid's ticket, which is $8. So, $24 + $8 is $32.

Now, let's add the cost of the popcorn. 2 bags of popcorn cost 2 x $3, which is $6. So, we add $32 and $6, and that's $38.

So, the family paid $38 in total."
"So, John's car broke down. It weighs 1200 pounds, and he's got some stuff in it, like a big bag and two little kids. The bag weighs 250 pounds, and the kids weigh 75 pounds each. We gotta add all that up to find the total weight.

The car is 1200 pounds, the bag is 250 pounds, and the kids are 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds. So, the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Now, we gotta figure out how much force John needs to push the car. The problem says it's 1% of the weight. That's like, 1 out of 100. So, we gotta multiply the total weight by 0.01.

0.01 * 1600 = 16

So, John needs to push the car with 16 pounds of force."
"So, James wants to hang them from his fence. His fence is like, a rectangle thingy. It's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. To find out how much string he needs, we gotta add up all the sides. 

There's two long sides and two short sides. So, we do 2 x 20 (for the long sides) and 2 x 15 (for the short sides). Then we add 'em together.

2 x 20 = 40
2 x 15 = 30
40 + 30 = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of string."
"So, there's this Mia and Emma thing. They're 16 years apart in age, and Mia is 40. We need to figure out their average age. 

First, we gotta find Emma's age. Since Mia is younger, we add 16 to Mia's age. That's 'cause Mia is 16 years younger than Emma. So, Emma's age is 40 + 16, which is 56.

Now, we got both their ages. We add 'em together and divide by 2 to get the average. That's 40 + 56, which is 96. Then we divide that by 2, and that's 48.

The answer is 48."
"So, Tom found some seashells, Nancy found some, and Benny found some too. They all had a bunch of 'em. Then, they found out that some of 'em were broken. We gotta count how many good ones they got.

Let's add up all the seashells they found: Tom had 214, Nancy had 432, and Benny had 86. That's 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells in total.

Now, we gotta subtract the broken ones. They found 67 broken ones. So, we subtract 67 from 732: 732 - 67 = 665.

So, they found 665 good seashells.

The final answer is: 665"
"So, I gotta figure out how much Avery's gonna spend on them plates. She's buyin' 3 kinds: dinner plates, salad plates, and bowls. The dinner plates cost $6 each, the salad plates cost $4 each, and the bowls cost $5 each. She's buyin' for 12 people.

First, I'm gonna calculate how much the dinner plates are gonna cost. That's 12 people times $6 per plate, which is... 12 x 6 = $72.

Next, I'm gonna do the same for the bowls. That's 12 people times $5 per plate, which is... 12 x 5 = $60.

And lastly, I'm gonna do the same for the salad plates. That's 12 people times $4 per plate, which is... 12 x 4 = $48.

Now, I'm gonna add 'em all together: $72 + $60 + $48 = $180.

So, Avery's gonna spend $180 on them plates."
"So, there's this fella Steve, and he took 10 hours to finish a puzzle. Now, there's this other lady Anna, and she took 2 hours more than half of what Steve took. Half of 10 is 5, so we gotta add 2 to that. 

5 + 2 = 7

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"So Dexter has five pigs, and they eat a lot of food. Each pig eats 4 pounds of food twice a day. That's like, 8 pounds of food per pig. So, five pigs eat 5 x 8 = 40 pounds of food per day.

Now, Dexter bought 300 pounds of food. He's gonna eat that in a week, which is 7 days. So, in 7 days, he'll eat 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

To find out how much food is left, we gotta subtract the food eaten from the food bought. That's 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The answer is 20."
"So, John's got a party and he's gonna invite 20 people. Each person's gonna eat 2 hot dogs, and he's already got 4 hot dogs from before. We need to figure out how many hot dogs he needs in total.

Let's see... 20 people, 2 hot dogs each... that's 20 x 2 = 40 hot dogs. But he's already got 4, so we need 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Now, we gotta know how many packs of hot dogs he needs. Each pack's got 6 hot dogs, so we divide 36 by 6... that's 6.

He needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2. So, 6 packs times $2 is... 6 x 2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"So, Frances sells cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, and 40 cookies for $1 each. That's a total of $40 from cupcakes and $40 from cookies. So, she made $80.

Then, she buys 5 trays of something for $4 each. I think she's buying trays of cookies or something. Anyway, that's $20.

Now, we gotta subtract the $20 she spent from the $80 she made. That's $60.

So, Frances has $60 left.

$60"
"So, there's this ice cream truck and kids are chasing it. They start with 5 kids on the first street. Then, on the second street, each of those 5 kids gets another kid, so now there's 5 + 5 = 10 kids. Then, on the third street, each of those 10 kids gets 2 more kids, so that's 10 + 20 = 30 kids. But then, the 5 original kids leave. So, we gotta subtract those 5 from 30, which is 30 - 5 = 25.

The answer is 25."
"So, there's this lady named Mamou, and she's tryin' to help out some families that got hurt in a flood. She's got a bunch of food to give 'em, and she's already given out some. 

She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday. We gotta add those up to see how many she's already given out. 

64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, we gotta subtract that from the total number of meals she had. She had 1,360 meals to start with. 

1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, she's got 1,218 meals left to give out."
"So, James found some coins in a vending machine. He got a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. I think I can count 'em. A quarter is 25 cents, and two nickels is 10 cents. And 7 dimes is 70 cents. Now, let's add 'em up. 25 + 10 + 70 is... 105 cents. That's how much money James has."
"So, there's this family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All the sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the other brother. We need to figure out the age of the older brother.

Since 12 is half of the older brother's age, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the older brother's age.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. The sisters are all 16. To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings:

12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"So, Charisma does some stuff every day. She sits and thinks for a bit when she wakes up and before she goes to bed. That's 30 minutes a day. She also does some yoga, but not every day. She does it 5 days a week, and that's 1 hour each time. 

There are 4 weeks, so we gotta figure out how many days that is. There's 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days. 

Now, let's add up the time she spends on meditation and yoga. She spends 30 minutes on meditation each day, so that's 30 * 28 = 840 minutes. She does yoga 5 days a week, and that's 1 hour, or 60 minutes, each time. So, that's 60 * 28 = 1680 minutes. 

We need to add those two numbers together: 840 + 1680 = 2520 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert that to hours by dividing by 60: 2520 / 60 = 42 hours.

The final answer is: 42"
"So, Octavia wanna make a quilt for her sister. She's gonna use old t-shirts. A small one is 3 square feet, a medium one is 4 square feet, and a large one is 6 square feet. She's got 11 small ones, 8 medium ones, and 6 large ones.

First, let's see how much fabric she needs for the small ones. 11 small ones * 3 square feet = 33 square feet. Then, she needs 8 medium ones * 4 square feet = 32 square feet. And for the large ones, 6 * 6 square feet = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. So, the quilt needs 101 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is 101."
"So, there's this thing about sunflowers. They got seeds, right? A small one has 3 dozen seeds. That's like, 3 groups of 12. So, it's 3 x 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, there's a big one. It's got 50% more seeds than the small one. That means it's got 36 + 50% of 36. 50% of 36 is like, 36 divided by 2, which is 18. So, the big one's got 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

We add 'em together, and we get 36 + 54 = 90 seeds. That's the total."
"So, there's this guy George, and he's got 18 pens. Now, Timothy's got three times as many pens as George. That means Timothy's got 18 * 3 = 54 pens.

Now, Sarah's got half as many pens as Timothy. So, we gotta divide 54 by 2. That's 54 / 2 = 27.

So, Sarah's got 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"So there's this girl Jackie, and she grew 3 inches over the summer. She's 2 inches shorter than this other girl, Anne. And Anne is twice as tall as this guy, Albert. Albert is 36 inches tall. 

So, Anne is 2 x 36 = 72 inches tall. And Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall. 

Now, we need to figure out how tall Jackie was before the summer. We know she grew 3 inches, so we need to subtract 3 from 70. That's 70 - 3 = 67 inches."
"So, there's this company that makes chocolate bars. They make 5000 bars in one day. They sell 'em for 2 bucks each. We wanna know how much money they make in two weeks.

First, we gotta figure out how many bars they make in two weeks. There's 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 7 * 2 = 14 days. If they make 5000 bars a day, they'll make 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars in two weeks.

Now, we know they sell each bar for 2 bucks. So, we multiply the number of bars by the price per bar: 70,000 * 2 = 140,000.

So, the company makes 140,000 dollars in two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"So, Jake is buyin' stuff at a store. He gets a deal on T-shirts. He buys 2 of 'em. They're $8 each. He gets one for full price and one for half price. Half price is 50% off, so he pays $8 for the first one and $4 for the second one. That's $12 for the T-shirts.

Then, he buys shoes. They're $40. But they're 40% off. That's 40% of $40, which is $16. So, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

To find out how much Jake spent, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes. That's $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"So, Ryan gets $6 a week for doin' his chores. He did 'em for 3 weeks, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 bucks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends, and they cost 1.25 each. So, that's 1.25 * 4 = 5 bucks. He spent that much, so he's left with 18 - 5 = 13 bucks.

Now, movie tickets cost 6.50 bucks each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we gotta divide 13 by 6.50. That's 13 ÷ 6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"So, Ellen and her sister Lani went to the mall. Ellen bought some stuff. She got a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. That's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought some stuff too. She got a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. That's $30 + $200 = $230.

So, we gotta add those two numbers together. $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"So, Tim makes a special honey and jam mix. He needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey to make one jar. The prices are: passion fruit is $6 a pound, jackfruit is $8 a pound, and honey is $10 a pound. He sells each jar for $50. How much money does Tim make from selling 10 jars?

To find out how much it costs to make one jar, we gotta add up the prices of the ingredients. So, 2 pounds of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12. 1.5 pounds of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12. And 2 pounds of honey is 2 * $10 = $20. So, the total cost of one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, we gotta find out how much money Tim makes from selling one jar. He sells each jar for $50, so his profit is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find out how much money Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we multiply his profit by 10. So, $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"So, there's this jar with a bunch of coins in it. It's got 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. I'm gonna count 'em up and see how much money's in there.

First, I'll count the quarters. 32 quarters is 32 * 25 cents, which is 800 cents. That's $8. Then I'll count the dimes. 95 dimes is 95 * 10 cents, which is 950 cents. That's $9.50. Next, I'll count the nickels. 120 nickels is 120 * 5 cents, which is 600 cents. That's $6. Finally, I'll count the pennies. 750 pennies is 750 * 1 cent, which is 750 cents. That's $7.50.

Now, I'll add 'em all up: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, then $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and finally $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"So, Janet went to the mall and spent some money. She bought ice cream for $3.50, two movie tickets for herself and her sister for $7.50 each, and a bracelet for $8.50. Her mom gave her $40. 

To find out how much money she has left, we gotta add up all the money she spent. 

$3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $28

Then we subtract that from the $40 her mom gave her. 

$40 - $28 = $12

So, Janet has $12 left."
"So, Josh has a car shop and he works there. He don't work on Sundays and Wednesdays, that's 5 days a week. He works 2 weeks, that's 10 days. He gets paid $4 for each car he fixes. He fixes 3 cars a day. So, he fixes 3 * 10 = 30 cars in 2 weeks. He gets $4 for each car, so he makes 30 * 4 = $120."
"So Randy had some cookies, right? He had oatmeal, chocolate chip, and sugar cookies. He ate some for breakfast, and then some more for lunch. Then he gave some away, and then he baked some more. Now he's got a bunch of cookies.

Let's see... He had oatmeal cookies, chocolate chip cookies, and sugar cookies. He ate 3 of each for breakfast, so he had 6 left. Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he had 4 oatmeal cookies left. He gave 2 sugar cookies away, so he had 4 sugar cookies left. He baked 4 of each kind for dinner, so now he's got 4 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

So, Randy's got 4 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies. Let's count 'em up: 4 + 7 + 4 = 15.

The answer is 15."
"So, there's this fella Matthew, and he's got 12 toy soldiers. He's tryin' to sell 'em. He's found someone who's willin' to buy half of 'em for $5 each, and the other half for $7 each. 

First, we gotta figure out how many toys he's sellin' to each person. Half of 12 is 6, so he's sellin' 6 to one person and 6 to the other. 

Now, let's calculate how much he's gonna get from each half. For the first half, he's sellin' 6 toys at $5 each, so that's 6 * 5 = $30. 

For the second half, he's sellin' 6 toys at $7 each, so that's 6 * 7 = $42. 

So, the total amount he's gonna get is $30 + $42 = $72."
"So, Nate's dog digs a lot of holes. He digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. That's a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes. Then, Nate comes home and fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes a day too. So, Nate fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day. To fill 84 holes, it'll take 84 / 3 = 28 days. There's 7 days in a week, so 28 days is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The answer is 4."
"So, there's this school, Norman High School, and it's got 4000 students. Then there's Butler High School, and it's got 3/4 of the students that Norman High School has. To find out how many students Butler High School has, I just multiply 4000 by 3/4. That's like, 4000 * 3/4 = 3000. 

Now, I gotta find out how many more students Norman High School has than Butler High School. I do that by subtractin' the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School. That's 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

So, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"So, the Adams family is makin' cookies, and they already made a bunch. They got 7995 cookies in total. They got 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. I'm gonna find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made.

To do that, I'm gonna subtract the other two kinds of cookies from the total. 

First, I'm gonna add the rainbow and oatmeal cookies together: 2595 + 3075 = 5670. Then, I'm gonna subtract that from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"So, there's this guy Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant Igor. They're doin' some kinda experiment. Igor's gotta get some stuff for 'em. He's supposed to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But Igor's a little careless, so he gets some stuff wrong.

He gets half as many test tubes as he's supposed to, so he gets 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He also gets 2 more Petri dishes than he's supposed to, so he gets 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. And he gets the right number of beakers, which is 7.

Now, Igor's got all this stuff on the lab bench, and it adds up to 29. But he lost some beakers. We need to figure out how many. Let's see... If he had 7 beakers and it's 29 in total, that means he lost some beakers. We can set up an equation to figure it out.

So, if we add up all the stuff he got, it's 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 31. But it's only 29, so he must have lost 2 beakers.

The final answer is 2."
"So, James is makin' 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. He's got 40 screws. We need to figure out how many screws he'll have left over.

First, we gotta find out how many screws he needs in total. We do that by multiplyin' the number of tables by the number of legs per table, and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

Now, we need to find out how many screws James has left over. We do that by subtractin' the total screws needed from the total screws he has.

40 - 32 = 8

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"So, there's this thing about eggs, right? We got 10 eggs in one basket, and then we got another basket with twice as many eggs. I think that means we gotta multiply the eggs in the first basket by 2 to find out how many eggs are in the second basket. So, 10 eggs times 2 is... 20 eggs. Now, we add those two numbers together, 10 and 20, and that's... 30 eggs."
"So, there's this thing about some girls raisin' money for a carnival. They got different amounts, and I'm gonna figure it out.

Alexandra raised $430. Then there's Kim, and she raised $320 more than Alexandra, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750. Then there's Maryam, and she raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700. And Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add 'em up: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The answer is: $2080"
"So, there's this guy Aaron and this girl Vanessa, and they're doin' a relay thingy. Aaron's faster than Vanessa, but she can run farther. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that, which is 2 miles. 

Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles. To find out how fast he's runnin', we divide the time by the distance. That's 16 minutes divided by 2 miles, which is 8 minutes per mile.

Now, we know Aaron's speed, so we can figure out how long it took Vanessa. She ran 4 miles, and we know she's slower than Aaron. We multiply the distance by Aaron's speed, which is 4 miles times 8 minutes per mile. That's 32 minutes.

The answer is 32."
"So, the caretaker needs line for the dock. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There's 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line. But he already has 6 feet. So, we gotta subtract that from 600. 

600 - 6 = 594

He needs 594 feet of line."
"So, Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. We need to figure out how much they make in a week.

First, let's see how much they make in a day. They get 6 reservations, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. So, that's 6 * 2 * 5 (for meals) + 5 (for the wine) = 6 * 10 + 5 = 65. They make 65 dollars a day.

Now, we need to figure out how much they make in a week. They are open 2 days a week. So, we multiply 65 by 2. That's 65 * 2 = 130.

The final answer is: $130"
"So, there's this fella who bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold 'em all at a profit of 25%. We gotta figure out how much he sold each one for.

First, we gotta find out how much he paid for each watermelon. We do that by dividin' the total cost by the number of watermelons. So, $80 divided by 50 is $1.60. That's how much he paid for each one.

Now, we gotta add a 25% profit to that price. A 25% profit means he's makin' an extra 25% of the cost price. That's like takin' 25% of $1.60. 25% of $1.60 is $0.40. So, we add that to the cost price: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

So, he sold each watermelon for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"So, there's this guy John, and he had a son named James. James is twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora's gonna be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. That means James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now. He had another son when he was 32, so that means the other son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the little guy's gonna be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"So, there's this basket with oranges, and two people, Ana and Jane, peeling them. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. They start peeling at the same time.

We need to figure out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane after an hour. 

Let's think about it. If they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, then in the second minute, Ana peels one less orange than Jane, in the third minute, she peels two less, and so on.

So, after an hour, Ana peels 1 orange less than Jane in the first minute, 2 oranges less in the second minute, 3 oranges less in the third minute, and so on, until 59 oranges less in the 59th minute.

We can add up all these numbers to find out how many oranges Ana peels. This is like adding 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 59. 

The sum of these numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 59 = 1770.

Now, Jane peels 60x oranges in an hour, where x is the number of oranges she peels in the first minute. 

The difference between the number of oranges Ana peels and the number of oranges Jane peels is 1770 - 60x.

Since x is the number of oranges Jane peels in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference 1770 - 60x is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana peels fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: $oxed{0}$"
"So, Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. He buys it from a junk shop for 80% off. That means he pays 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 * $400 = $80. So, the radiator costs $80.

Then, he hires a mechanic to install it. The mechanic charges $50 an hour, and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The answer is: $230"
"So, there's this farmer, right? He's got a bunch of animals on his farm. I think he's got 20 of 'em. They're either chickens or cows. And they all have a total of 70 legs. Now, I'm not exactly sure how many legs chickens have, but I think cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs, right?

So, let's say the number of chickens is x. That means the number of cows is 20 - x. We gotta figure out how many chickens there are. We can do that by settin' up an equation. We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Now, let's simplify this thing. We can start by multiplyin' 4 by 20, which is 80. Then we can subtract 4x from both sides. That gives us:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70

Now, let's combine like terms. We can subtract 2x from both sides, which gives us:

-2x + 80 = 70

Next, we can subtract 80 from both sides, which gives us:

-2x = -10

Now, we can divide both sides by -2, which gives us:

x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens. And if there are 5 chickens, then there are 20 - 5 = 15 cows.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there's this fella Henry and his 3 friends, and they order 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. They wanna share 'em equally, so we gotta figure out how many slices each person gets.

First, we gotta know how many slices there are in total. We got 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices, so we multiply 7 by 8, which is 56 slices.

Now, we gotta divide the slices among the 4 of 'em. We do that by dividing 56 by 4, and that's 14 slices per person.

So, each person gets 14 slices."
