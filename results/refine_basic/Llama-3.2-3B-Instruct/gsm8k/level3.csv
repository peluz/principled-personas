"To calculate the daily earnings at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs left after accounting for breakfast and baking. 

First, we subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast: 16 (total eggs) - 3 (eggs eaten) = 13 eggs.

Next, we subtract the eggs baked for friends: 13 (remaining eggs) - 4 (eggs baked) = 9 eggs.

Now, we multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2/2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The profit made by Josh is $120,000."
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

The multiplication can be broken down as follows:

3 (number of sprints per week) Ã— 60 (meters per sprint) = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total amount of feed given to her chickens in the morning and afternoon. 

In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given so far is the sum of the morning and afternoon feed: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total daily feed needed. However, we are only concerned with the remaining amount of feed for the final meal. 

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily feed. 

First, we calculate the total daily feed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups. 

Now, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily feed: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the discount structure. The first glass costs $5, and every subsequent glass costs 60% of the original price. 

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
- The third glass also costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
- This pattern continues for the remaining 14 glasses.

To simplify the calculation, we can find the cost of one discounted glass and multiply it by the total number of glasses. The cost of one discounted glass is $5 * 0.6 = $3.

Now, we multiply the cost of one discounted glass by the total number of glasses: $3 * 15 = $45.

Adding the cost of the first glass, we get the total cost: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can use the given information. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the download speed, the percentage of the file downloaded before the interruption, and the time spent on the restart.

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute. Since the download is interrupted 40% of the way through, she has already downloaded 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This leaves 0.2 * 200 GB = 40 GB remaining.

The time spent downloading the remaining 40 GB at 2 GB/minute is 40 GB / 2 GB/minute = 20 minutes.

Additionally, the download is interrupted and requires a 20-minute restart.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 20 minutes (downloading the first 160 GB) + 20 minutes (restart) + 20 minutes (downloading the remaining 40 GB) = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Next, we consider the 2 hours spent in standstill traffic, during which he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance John traveled during the 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

To find the total distance John is from home, we add the distances traveled during each segment:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Therefore, John is 355 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is 355."
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours. 

First, we calculate her earnings for the regular hours worked (40 hours) at her regular hourly rate of $10. 

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 45 hours in total, the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12.

For the overtime hours, her earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The total earnings for Eliza for the week is $460."
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down into steps.

First, we find the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the downloads in the first month. This can be calculated as 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Next, we need to find the number of downloads in the third month, which is 30% less than the downloads in the second month. To do this, we calculate 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads. Then, we subtract this from the downloads in the second month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from each month to find the total: 60 (Month 1) + 180 (Month 2) + 126 (Month 3) = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen and then add the results together.

For the donuts, we have 3 dozen at $68 per dozen, so the total cost is 3 * 68 = 204.

For the mini cupcakes, we have 2 dozen at $80 per dozen, so the total cost is 2 * 80 = 160.

For the mini cheesecakes, we have 6 dozen at $55 per dozen, so the total cost is 6 * 55 = 330.

Now, let's add the costs together: 204 + 160 + 330 = 694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point, we need to calculate the net profit per year. The tree generates $10.50 in revenue from lemons and incurs an annual cost of $3. The net profit per year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

To find the break-even point, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to break even.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold 1/2 of the remaining vacuum cleaners after selling at the green house and red house.

Let's assume she sold x vacuum cleaners at the green house and 2 at the red house. Then, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x + 2.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is 5 + (x + 2) = y.

Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is twice the number she sold at the orange house. So, y = 2 * (number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house).

Let's represent the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house as z. Then, y = 2z.

Now, we can set up the equation: 5 + (x + 2) = 2z

We also know that z = (x + 2)/2, since she sold half of what was left after selling at the green and red house.

Substituting z in the first equation, we get: 5 + (x + 2) = 2 * ((x + 2)/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 5 + (x + 2) = x + 2

Subtracting x + 2 from both sides, we get: 3 = 0

This is not possible, so let's re-examine our assumptions. We assumed that the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is half of what was left after selling at the green and red house. However, this assumption may not be correct.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is 5 + 2 = 7.

Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the green house is 3 times the number she sold at the green house. Let's represent the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house as x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the green house is 3x.

We also know that the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the green house is 7. So, 3x = 7

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 7/3

Since x is the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is 3x = 3 * (7/3) = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can start by finding the percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20%. This means 80% of the students are not enrolled in contemporary dance.

The remaining students are 100% - 20% = 80%. Then, 25% of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find the percentage of students enrolled in jazz dance, we multiply 80% by 25%: 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.2 or 20%. This means 20% of the total students are enrolled in jazz dance.

Now, to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the sum of the percentages of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from 100%. So, 100% - (20% + 20%) = 60%.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

The jewelry has an initial cost of $5,000 and is expected to increase by 2.5%. This can be calculated as:

$5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

The electronic gadgets have an initial cost of $8,000 and are expected to increase by 1.2%. This can be calculated as:

$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

To maximize profit, we need to compare the potential value of each option to its initial cost. 

The profit from the jewelry is $5,250 - $5,000 = $250.
The profit from the electronic gadgets is $8,160 - $8,000 = $160.

Since $250 is greater than $160, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The final answer is: $250"
"When two trains depart from San Rafael at the same time and travel westward for 80 miles, they are essentially covering the same distance. The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering a combined total of 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the fact that they are traveling in the same direction (northward) on the second day. Since they were initially traveling westward, we need to find the distance they would have covered if they had traveled northward for the same amount of time.

Since they traveled 80 miles westward, we can assume they traveled for 80 miles in the westward direction. To find the equivalent distance they would have traveled northward, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the distance traveled westward) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the distances traveled northward and westward).

Let's denote the distance traveled northward as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

80^2 = x^2 + 80^2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6400 = x^2 + 6400

Subtracting 6400 from both sides, we get:

0 = x^2

x = 0

This means that the distance traveled northward is 0 miles, since the trains were traveling westward for 80 miles and then changed direction to travel northward.

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the trains are traveling in the same direction (northward) on the second day. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since the trains are traveling in the same direction (northward) on the second day, we can assume that they are traveling at the same speed. We know that they traveled a combined total of 150 miles northward, and they were traveling for the same amount of time. We can set up a proportion to find the distance each train traveled:

Let's say the distance each train traveled northward is 'x'. We can set up the proportion:

x / 80 = 150 / (80 + 80)

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

x / 80 = 150 / 160

Cross-multiplying, we get:

160x = 150 * 80

160x = 12000

Dividing both sides by 160, we get:

x = 75

So, each train traveled 75 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled on both days:

Total distance = 80 miles (westward) + 75 miles (northward) = 155 miles

The final answer is: 155"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply her hourly wages by the number of hours she works per week and then add the results together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching: 
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weekly earnings: $20 * 35 = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700 * 50 = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching: 
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weekly earnings: $30 * 15 = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450 * 50 = $22,500

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching: 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per day (3) by 7 to find the total number of eggs per week: 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.

Next, we multiply the total number of eggs per week (21) by 4 to find the total number of eggs in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs (84) by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen: 84 Ã· 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the speed required for the remaining distance, we can use the concept of average speed. 

First, we need to find the total time Marissa needs to spend to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. 

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain the desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain the desired average speed for the entire 12-mile trail.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 9 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age difference between Raymond and Samantha, we subtract Raymond's age from Samantha's age. 

Samantha's age: 31
Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25

Now, we need to find the age difference between Raymond's son's birth year and the current year. We know Raymond's son was born at the age of 23. To find the current year of Raymond's son's birth, we add 23 to the current year.

Current year: 31
Raymond's son's birth year: 31 + 23 = 54

Now, we subtract the current year from the year of Raymond's son's birth to find the number of years that have passed since his birth.

54 - 31 = 23

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

Final answer: 23"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

We can break this down into two separate calculations:

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so we can calculate the total number of DVDs sold to these customers as 3 x 1 = 3.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so we can calculate the total number of DVDs sold to these customers as 2 x 2 = 4.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total length of time the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between the end time and the start time. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can find the total length of melting by multiplying the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage in decimal form).

Given the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%, we can plug in the values as follows:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original Price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the items Marie ordered is the sum of the costs of the chicken meal, milk, apples, and pizza boxes. We know the costs of the chicken meal ($12), milk (5 packs at $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15), and apples (4 at $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6). The cost of each pizza box is $8.50.

The total cost of the items can be represented by the equation:

$12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

$33 + $8.50x = $50

Subtract $33 from both sides of the equation:

$8.50x = $17

Divide both sides of the equation by $8.50:

x = $17 Ã· $8.50
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

The total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream, we need to calculate the number of cartons Cynthia will purchase and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 Ã· 15 = 4

This means she will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 * $4.00 = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"The art of subtraction. It's a delicate dance of numbers, where the right steps can lead to a beautiful solution, while the wrong ones can result in a mess.

In this case, we're dealing with a bike trip that spans 60 miles. Henry makes two stops, the first after 20 miles and the second 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find the distance between these two stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Let's start by finding the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. We subtract 20 miles from the total distance:

60 - 20 = 40 miles

Now, we need to find the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we subtract 15 miles from the total distance:

60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, we want to find the distance between the first and second stops. To do this, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. But wait, we're subtracting a distance that's actually in the opposite direction! To get the correct answer, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, but in the opposite direction. So, we'll add the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop to the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

40 + 45 = 85 miles

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we need to subtract 15 miles from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

40 - 15 = 25 miles

The correct answer is 25 miles.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the cost of the boots, let's denote the cost of the boots as x. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which is $66. The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

x - 33 - 66 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 99 = 5

Add 99 to both sides:

x = 104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average of the three guesses, we need to add them together and divide by 3.

Let's start by adding the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average: 240 Ã· 3 = 80.

Therefore, the average guess is 80.

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day and then multiply the result by 7.

Let's break it down:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day
5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs."
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method.

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's represent the number of jewels each person has with variables:

Let S = number of jewels Siobhan has
Let A = number of jewels Aaron has
Let R = number of jewels Raymond has

We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
   Since R = 40, half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20
   A = 20 + 5 = 25
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation for S:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = points in the first 20 minutes + points in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, we can find the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days: 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25/yogurt = $75.

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the total amount John got from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we calculate the total amount he spent on video games. He bought 8 games for $20 each, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

We know that after buying the video games, John had $5 left. To find out how much he had initially, we subtract the amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left from the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets: $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Now, we know John had $30 initially. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: $195 / $15 = 13.

However, since he sold all his Lego sets, we need to find out how many he has left. To do this, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he initially had: 13 - 13 = 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To calculate John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote Dana's walking speed as W and her running speed as R. We know that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so we can write an equation:

R = 2W

We are also given that Dana's walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour, so we can substitute this value into the first equation:

R = 2(1.5)
R = 3

Now that we have found Dana's running speed, we can use the fact that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let's denote the total time as T. We can set up an equation for the total time:

T = (1/3)R + (2/3)W

Substituting the values of R and W, we get:

T = (1/3)(3) + (2/3)(1.5)
T = 1 + 1
T = 2

Now that we have the total time, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. We know that distance = speed * time, so:

Distance run = R * (1/3)T
Distance run = 3 * (1/3)(2)
Distance run = 2

Distance walked = W * (2/3)T
Distance walked = 1.5 * (2/3)(2)
Distance walked = 1

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked
Total distance traveled = 2 + 1
Total distance traveled = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as D.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S = 2 * 1 = 2.

Finally, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B = 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"When it comes to calculating the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to consider the relationship between the distance she can throw the javelin with and without the gemstone.

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as 'x'. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther with the gemstone, the distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 3x - 1000.

However, we are given that the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone is 400 feet. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1200 (since she can throw it three times farther with the gemstone).

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 1200 / 3 = 400.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 3x - 1000 = 3(400) - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can use the concept of multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. 

Next, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories left.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100g, we multiply 0.8 servings by 100g per serving.

0.8 * 100 = 80g

Therefore, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost of the wicks is already included in the initial cost of the pound of wax. Therefore, the total cost is simply the cost of the pound of wax.

Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday. Since each article takes 4 hours, we can calculate the total hours spent on Monday as 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Next, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. We are told that she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we can multiply 5 by 2 and divide by 5, which gives us 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, we can calculate the total hours spent on Tuesday as 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, we are told that she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, we can calculate the total hours spent on Wednesday as 7 * 2 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, we can add up the hours spent on each day to find the total hours spent writing articles: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes Candice initially had as x. We know that she used 220 notes at work and had 23 notes remaining. Since she initially had 80 notes in her purse, we can set up the equation:

x = 80 + 220 + 23

However, this equation is not accurate because it counts the notes she used at work twice. A more accurate representation would be:

x = 80 + (number of notes in the package)

Since she used 220 notes at work, the total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes in the package and the notes she used at work, plus the notes she had in her purse. We can represent this as:

x = (number of notes in the package) + 220 + 80

We know that x = 323. So, we can set up the equation:

323 = (number of notes in the package) + 220 + 80

Now, we can solve for the number of notes in the package:

(number of notes in the package) = 323 - 220 - 80
(number of notes in the package) = 23

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the number of blue ties is B and the cost of a blue tie is C. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2B. The cost of a red tie is 1.5C (50% more than the cost of a blue tie).

We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can set up the equation:
B x C = 200

We also know that the total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
B x C + 2B x 1.5C = Total

Substituting B x C = 200 into the second equation, we get:
200 + 2B x 1.5C = Total

Since we want to find the total amount spent on ties, we can simplify the equation:
200 + 3BC = Total

Now, we need to find the value of B and C. We can use the fact that B x C = 200 to express C in terms of B:
C = 200 / B

Substituting this expression for C into the equation 200 + 3BC, we get:
200 + 3B(200 / B) = Total
200 + 600 = Total
800 = Total

Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):
48 Ã· 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:
3/4 * 120 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 - 90 = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by the number of days in a week and then divide by 12 to get the number of dozens, and finally multiply by the price per dozen.

First, let's multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days in a week:
252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens:
1764 eggs/week Ã· 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Finally, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To calculate the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to consider the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. We know that he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, we need to find out how many pounds he still needs to remove.

Let's denote the number of toys he needs to remove as 'x'. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up the equation:
(1/2)x + 7.5 = 15

To solve for 'x', we can first subtract 7.5 from both sides of the equation:
(1/2)x = 15 - 7.5
(1/2)x = 7.5

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
x = 7.5 * 2
x = 15

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of toys, not the total weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up the equation:
(1/2)x = 7.5

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
x = 7.5 * 2
x = 15

Since we multiplied by 2, we actually multiplied the weight by 2, not the number of toys. To find the correct number of toys, we can divide 7.5 by 0.5:
x = 7.5 / 0.5
x = 15

However, this is still not correct. We need to find the number of toys, not the total weight. Since each toy weighs 0.5 pounds, we can divide 7.5 by 0.5:

This is still not correct. We need to find the number of toys, not the total weight. Since each toy weighs 0.5 pounds, we can divide 7.5 by 0.5:
x = 7.5 / 0.5
x = 15

This is still not correct. We need to find the number of toys, not the total weight. Since each toy weighs 0.5 pounds, we can divide 7.5 by 0.5:

"The problem presents two scenarios where a mechanic charges different rates for repairing truck and car tires. To determine which day generated more revenue, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since we're looking for the difference in revenue, we'll consider the absolute value, which is $40.

The day with higher revenue is Friday, and the difference in revenue is $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to calculate the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can multiply 12 by 3 to find Patchy's total. 

12 * 3 = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 + 12 = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to subtract the number of lollipops she ate from the total number of lollipops she initially had. 

Let's perform the subtraction: 30 (initial lollipops) - 2 (lollipops eaten) = 28 lollipops remaining.

Next, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill. 

28 Ã· 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of the ticket and popcorn.

The cost of the ticket and popcorn is $14. We can set up the division problem as follows:

$42 Ã· $14 = ?

To solve this problem, we can use long division or a calculator. 

$42 Ã· $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, we divide the maximum weight available for boxes by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the 25% fee on the original bill of $40.00. This is done by multiplying $40.00 by 0.25, which equals $10.00.

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the 25% fee, resulting in a total of $13.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total, which gives us $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees ($13.00) to the original bill ($40.00), resulting in a subtotal of $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $53.00 + $17.00 = $70.00.

Final answer: $70.00"
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. We have 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster. To find the total, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187.

The final answer is: $\boxed{187}$"
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to consider the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

First, we calculate the total cost of the material and construction: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1, which equals $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is a fixed amount of $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, we need to calculate 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. To find 5% of this value, we multiply $50,000 by 0.05, which equals $2,500.

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial amount for the first half of the year and the reduced amount for the second half of the year.

The initial amount for the first half of the year is $140 per month, and there are 6 months in a half year. So, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the reduced amount is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon (mpg) of Sophia's car, we can use the information provided. We know that the car's tank holds 12 gallons and that Sophia has already used 4 gallons to fill it up after traveling 100 miles.

We can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon:

100 miles Ã· 4 gallons = x miles Ã· 12 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
100 * 12 = 4x
1200 = 4x
x = 1200 / 4
x = 300

This means that Sophia's car can travel 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: 300"
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each day and then multiply it by 28 (4 weeks).

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, the number of teachers is 180 / 5 = 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the initial amount of money Bailey started with, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount as x.

The total amount Bailey has at the end of 8 weeks is the sum of her initial amount and her weekly allowance for 8 weeks. Since her weekly allowance is $5, the total allowance for 8 weeks is 5 * 8 = $40.

We know that the total amount at the end is $100. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, and she teaches 5 classes per day, we can multiply 5 (classes per day) by 5 (days) to get the total number of classes on weekdays: 5 * 5 = 25.

Next, we add the 8 classes she teaches on Saturday to get the total number of classes in a week: 25 + 8 = 33.

Now, we know that each class has 15 students. To find the total number of students, we multiply the total number of classes by the number of students per class: 33 * 15 = 495.

Finally, we multiply the total number of students by the charge per student to find Judy's weekly earnings: 495 * 15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To determine the total number of instructions, we need to calculate the sum of the instructions in both recipes. 

Recipe 1 has 20 instructions. Since Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, we can calculate the number of instructions in Recipe 2 by multiplying the number of instructions in Recipe 1 by 2. 

20 * 2 = 40

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes to find the total.

20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies by the price per brownie and the number of cheesecakes by the price per cheesecake, then add the results together.

First, we multiply 43 (the number of brownies) by 3 (the price per brownie): 43 * 3 = 129.

Next, we multiply 23 (the number of cheesecakes) by 4 (the price per cheesecake): 23 * 4 = 92.

Finally, we add the results together: 129 + 92 = 221.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the cost of the cell phone.

The cost of each cell phone is $150. The interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

So, the total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is $150 + $3 = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay each month is 5 x $153 = $765.

The answer is: $765"
"To calculate the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of pots by the price per pot and then round the result to the nearest dollar.

"To find the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the series
- a is the first term (top level) = 16
- r is the common ratio (since each level has half the square footage of the level below it) = 1/2
- n is the number of terms (levels) = 4

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

Since there are 4 levels, the average square footage is:
Average = S / n
Average = 30 / 4
Average = 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days. Since the puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily amount: 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, and the puppy will require 2 cups of dog food per day. So, we can multiply the number of days by the daily amount: 365 days * 2 cups/day = 730 cups.

Now, we add the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the rest of the year: 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by the amount in each bag to find the number of bags: 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Cecilia will need 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the amount of laundry each person does, we can use the given information to set up a ratio. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as x. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express Sarah's laundry as 4x. We are also told that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can express Raymond's laundry as 2x.

We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

Now that we know David's laundry amount, we can find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry:

Raymond's laundry = 2x
Raymond's laundry = 2 * 100
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

David's laundry = x
David's laundry = 100 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Cost per unit: $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Cost per unit: $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is: $0.8333 - $0.50 = $0.3333

Final answer: $0.33"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to find 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

First, we'll calculate 30% of $100:
30% of $100 = 0.3 x $100 = $30

Now, we'll subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find the amount of water left, we need to calculate the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can multiply 24 by 1/6. To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the numerator (1) by the whole number (24) and then divide by the denominator (6). 

24 * 1 = 24
24 Ã· 6 = 4

So, the two girls got 4 liters together. Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got:
4 + 6 = 10 liters

Now, we subtract the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy from the initial 24 liters:
24 - 10 = 14 liters

There were 14 liters of water left."
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we need to consider the sequence of events that affected his sticker collection.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 stickers from a store and 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This results in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, reducing his collection to 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is 17."
"To find Alex's weight, we can use the formula: Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2. 

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can plug in the value into the formula: 
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, let's add their weights together:
Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498
Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 623 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"
"The art of multiplication! It's a fundamental operation that can be applied in various contexts, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem.

To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of rose bushes (3) by the number of roses per bush (25):
3 Ã— 25 = 75
2. Multiply the result (75) by the number of thorns per rose (8):
75 Ã— 8 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of games won as 'w' and the number of games lost as 'l'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

w + l = 22

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be represented as:

w = l + 8

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' from the second equation into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combine like terms:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2l = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 7

Now that we have found the value of 'l', we can substitute it back into the equation w = l + 8 to find the value of 'w':

w = 7 + 8
w = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

Final answer: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial salary) = $600
r = annual interest rate (10% = 0.1)
n = number of years

First, we calculate the salary after 5 years:
A = 600(1 + 0.1)^5
A = 600(1.1)^5
A = 600 * 1.61051
A = 966.306

Now, we calculate the salary after 3 more years:
A = 966.306(1 + 0.1)^3
A = 966.306(1.1)^3
A = 966.306 * 1.331
A = 1286.153

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"To solve for the number of copies Harald sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is 8,000."
"To determine the number of guests attending the party, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is calculated as (3/4) * 16 = 12.

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we must first calculate the amount for adults and children separately. 

For adults, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult will eat: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Since children eat half as much as adults, we can calculate the amount for children by multiplying the number of children by half of the adult amount: 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amounts for adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the number of pets each person has. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia's pets can be represented as x + 2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan's pets can be represented as 3(x + 2).

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so we can set up the equation x = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pets, we get:

Marcia's pets: 3(4 + 2) = 3(6) = 18
Jan's pets: 3(4 + 2) = 3(6) = 18

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 18 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 40.

The total number of pets the three have is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the children as variables: 

Let A = Amy's age
J = Jackson's age
C = Corey's age
J = James' age

We are given the following information:

1. James is 10 years old, so J = 10.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so J = C - 1.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so A = J + 5.
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so A = C - 2.

We can use these equations to solve for the ages of the children. 

From equation (2), we can substitute J = 10 into J = C - 1, which gives us 10 = C - 1. Solving for C, we get C = 11.

Now that we know C = 11, we can substitute this value into equation (4) to find A: A = 11 - 2 = 9.

Finally, we can substitute A = 9 into equation (3) to find J: 9 = J + 5. Solving for J, we get J = 4.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Gerald's original time be 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

x + 0.1x = 36 + 3.6
0.1x = 39.6
x = 396

However, we are looking for Gerald's new time, not his original time. We can find his new time by adding 10% of his original time to his original time:

New time = x + 0.1x
= 1.1x
= 1.1 * 36
= 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can write the equation:

R = D + C - 12

We also know that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write another equation:

C = 2D

We are given that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the second equation to find the number of cats:

C = 2(60)
C = 120

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the number of rabbits:

R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

To find the total number of pets, we can add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we need to calculate 2/3 of Harry's hours and then subtract that from Harry's total hours.

First, let's calculate 2/3 of 9 hours:
(2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Now, we subtract 6 hours from Harry's total hours:
9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the ratio of tomatoes to sauce. We know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. 

Since Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can set up a proportion to find out how many tomatoes she used. Let's use 'x' to represent the number of 16-ounce cans of tomatoes. The proportion can be set up as follows:

3/16 = x/32

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

3 * 32 = 16x
96 = 16x

Now, divide both sides by 16:

x = 96/16
x = 6

Since 'x' represents the number of 16-ounce cans of tomatoes, we can multiply it by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes:

6 * 3 = 18

So, Freda used 18 tomatoes.

Final answer: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she already has and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

40 * 2 = 80

Next, we need to subtract the number of plants she will give away, which is 40. 

80 - 40 = 40

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. To do this, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break it down into two parts: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water per day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 1 glass/day * 5 days = 5 glasses.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 0 glasses on Sunday.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses from weekdays and weekends: 5 glasses + 1 glass = 6 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the concept of ratios. The given information states that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can express this as a ratio of distance to time: 3 miles : 10 minutes.

Since the city is 42 miles across, we can set up a proportion to find the time it will take to cover the entire city. Let's denote the unknown time as x minutes.

The ratio of distance to time remains constant, so we can set up the proportion:

3 miles / 10 minutes = 42 miles / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 42 * 10
3x = 420
x = 420 / 3
x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the number of pieces left, we need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. To find a quarter of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 1/4. 

1000 * 1/4 = 1000 * 0.25 = 250

Now, we subtract 250 from the total number of pieces: 1000 - 250 = 750.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we can multiply 750 by 1/3.

750 * 1/3 = 750 * 0.33 = 250

Now, we subtract 250 from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500

There are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed."
"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can represent this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. This means for every 1 cookie Amir eats, Cody eats 3 cookies. 

Given that Amir eats 5 cookies, we can multiply 5 by 3 to find the number of cookies Cody eats: 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of 1-hour episodes watched on Monday and Tuesday as x, the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as y, and the number of 1-hour episodes watched on Thursday and Friday as z.

We know that the total time watched on Monday and Tuesday is 2 hours, so we can write the equation: x + x = 2.

We also know that the total time watched on Thursday is 1.5 hours, which is equivalent to 90 minutes. Since he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, we can write the equation: z + (y/2) = 1.5.

Additionally, we know that the total time watched on Friday is 2 hours, so we can write the equation: z + z = 2.

We are also given that the total time watched is 7 hours, so we can write the equation: x + x + z + z + y = 7.

Now we have a system of four equations:

x + x = 2
z + (y/2) = 1.5
z + z = 2
x + x + z + z + y = 7

We can simplify the first equation to 2x = 2, which gives us x = 1.

We can simplify the third equation to 2z = 2, which gives us z = 1.

Substituting x = 1 and z = 1 into the fourth equation, we get 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + y = 7, which simplifies to y = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Since he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, the number of cookies he bakes this year is 2x.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he bakes this year is 2x + 15. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is calculated by multiplying 10 gallons by $3.00 per gallon, which equals $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback amount by multiplying 10 gallons by $0.20 per gallon, which equals $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates and proportions. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We also know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We can set up a proportion to relate the distance and time:

2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 20 feet

We can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying:

2 * 20 = 10x
40 = 10x
x = 40 / 10
x = 4 liters per 20 feet

Now that we know the rate at which the boat is taking on water, we can find the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the rate by the total distance:

Total water = rate * total distance
Total water = 4 liters/20 feet * 64 feet
Total water = 4 * 64 / 20
Total water = 64 / 5
Total water = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.8}$"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons per day and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

We can break this down into steps:

1. Multiply the number of teachers (4) by the number of lessons per day (2): 4 x 2 = 8
2. Multiply the result by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson (3): 8 x 3 = 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we can use the formula for multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we multiply the number of flowers planted per day (2) by the number of days (15). This gives us 2 * 15 = 30. 

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow (5) from the total. So, 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

B = 6D

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This can be written as:

B = 50D

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for D by setting the two equations equal to each other:

6D = 50D

Subtracting 6D from both sides gives us:

0 = 44D

Dividing both sides by 44 gives us:

D = 0

So, there are 0 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

0"
"To calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 (approximately)

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To calculate the total amount John paid, we can use the distributive property of multiplication. We multiply the number of pairs of shoes per child (2) by the cost per pair ($60) and then multiply the result by the number of children (3).

This can be represented as: 2 * 3 * 60

First, we multiply 2 and 3: 2 * 3 = 6
Then, we multiply 6 by 60: 6 * 60 = 360

Therefore, John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as x.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles is 5 times the number of containers. We know that the total number of vehicles is 30, so we can write the equation:

5x + 2(5) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x + 10 = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

5x = 20

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 4

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"To calculate the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply 2 pads per week by 4 weeks:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 5 miles per hour. Again, using the same formula, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60 letters. This means she put stamps on 60/3 = 20 letters.

Now, we are given that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. To find the initial number of letters, we can subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current total:

30 (already-stamped letters) - 20 (letters put stamps on) = 10 letters

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of spoons in the package Julia initially bought. We know that her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. The total number of spoons she had at the end is 12. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

The number of chicken sausages is 38. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages can be calculated as 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."
"The problem presents a straightforward scenario where we need to find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together. To do this, we can start by identifying the number of friends each individual has.

Lily has 50 friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can calculate Amy's total friends by adding 20 to Lily's total. This gives us 50 + 20 = 70 friends for Amy.

Now, to find the combined total, we simply add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of a watermelon as W, the cost of a pepper as P, and the cost of an orange as O.

We know that a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so we can write the equation:
W = 3P

We also know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so we can write the equation:
O = W - 5

We are given that each pepper costs 15$, so P = 15.

Now, we can substitute P = 15 into the first equation to find the cost of a watermelon:
W = 3(15)
W = 45

Next, we can substitute W = 45 into the second equation to find the cost of an orange:
O = 45 - 5
O = 40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
Total cost = 4W + 20P + 10O
Total cost = 4(45) + 20(15) + 10(40)
Total cost = 180 + 300 + 400
Total cost = 880

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from both patients and doctors.

First, we convert the total time spent on patients from minutes to hours: 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total time by 60 to get the total hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from patients: 500 people * $200/person = $100,000.

The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour, so the total revenue from doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000.

The total cost is the sum of the revenue from doctors, as the hospital does not incur any costs for the patients: $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $100,000."
"To find the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can find this number by dividing 60 (the total number of elves) by 3.

60 Ã· 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves remaining, we subtract 20 from the total number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40

Next, we need to find the number of elves that quit after kids kick their shins. We are told that 10 elves quit in this situation. To find the number of elves remaining, we subtract 10 from the previous result:

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is 30."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Then, he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. This means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes in a year, we can multiply the number of car washes per month (4) by the number of months in a year (12), and then multiply the result by the cost of each car wash ($15).

This can be represented as:

4 (car washes/month) Ã— 12 (months/year) Ã— $15 (cost/car wash)

Using the associative and commutative properties of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to:

4 Ã— (12 Ã— $15)

First, we multiply 12 by $15:

12 Ã— $15 = $180

Now, we multiply 4 by the result:

4 Ã— $180 = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The final answer is: $720"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can represent this as 1/3 of 27. To find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we can multiply 27 by 1/3.

27 * (1/3) = 9

Now, we need to find two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. We can represent this as 2/3 of 9.

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the cost of each item:
- 2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Next, we add the costs of the items together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Now, we calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items: 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Finally, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items and the tip: $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract it from the total number of questions in each test.

Mark completed 40 questions in the first test and 30 questions in the second test. 

The total number of questions completed is 40 + 30 = 70.

The first test had 75 questions, and the second test had 100 questions. 

To find the total number of questions Mark completed, we can calculate the total questions completed per hour and multiply it by the total time spent on both tests. 

Mark completed 5 questions per hour. He spent 8 hours on the first test and 6 hours on the second test. 

The total time spent is 8 + 6 = 14 hours. 

The total number of questions completed is 5 questions/hour * 14 hours = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, we can calculate the total number of questions Mark left incomplete by adding the questions left in each test. 

The number of questions left in the first test is 75 - 40 = 35. 
The number of questions left in the second test is 100 - 30 = 70.

The total number of questions left incomplete is 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is 105."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods. Let's represent the number of blue gumballs as 'b' and the number of pink gumballs as 'p'. We are given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:

p = 4b + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so b = 12. We can substitute this value into the equation:

p = 4(12) + 22
p = 48 + 22
p = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to determine the proportion of semi-automatic cars to the total number of cars. 

First, we calculate the total number of non-semi-automatic cars: 
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Total non-semi-automatic cars = Automatic cars + Manual cars
= 12 + 4
= 16

Now, we find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the total non-semi-automatic cars from the total number of cars:
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Total non-semi-automatic cars
= 20 - 16
= 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The correct answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write the equation:

W = 2B

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write the equation:

B = 2Q

Finally, we know that the total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Therefore, we can write the equation:

W + B + Q = 700

Now we have a system of three equations:

1. W = 2B
2. B = 2Q
3. W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the expression for W from equation (1) into equation (3):

2B + B + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

3B + Q = 700

Now, substitute the expression for B from equation (2) into the equation above:

3(2Q) + Q = 700

Expand and simplify:

6Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:

B = 2Q
= 2(100)
= 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 2B
= 2(200)
= 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is 400."
"The art of multiplication! It's a fundamental concept that can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We have two quantities: 2 hours per day and 7 days in a week. To find the total hours worked in a week, we can multiply these two quantities together. This is a classic example of multiplication, where we're combining two numbers to get a total.

The calculation is straightforward: 2 hours/day Ã— 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Now, let's talk about the earnings. We know that Jordan earns $10 per hour. To find his weekly earnings, we can multiply the total hours worked in a week by his hourly wage.

The calculation is: 14 hours/week Ã— $10/hour = $140/week.

In conclusion, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first identify the food and non-food items. The food items are milk and eggs, while the non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The total cost of the food items is $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5.

The total cost of the non-food items is $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Next, we calculate the tax on the non-food items. Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.10 (10% tax rate):
$10 (non-food items) * 0.10 (10% tax) = $1

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items:
$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax):
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items) = $16

The total cost of everything is $16.

**The final answer is $16.**"
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients.

The cost of bleach is 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client, which equals 16 bottles of bleach. Since each bottle costs $2, the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.

The cost of cloths is 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client, which equals 8 packs of cloths. Since each pack costs $5, the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. Total income is given as $92. 

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to consider the frequency of harvesting. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we can multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year).

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (the number of harvests in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. 

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. We know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. Half of 30 is 30/2 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave. Twice 30 is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees left in the first 3 periods (6 hours + 6 hours + 6 hours). We already know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. So, the total number of bees that left in the first 3 periods is 30 + 60 = 90 bees. Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the first 3 periods and hadn't returned yet is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the first 3 periods return. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 75 bees.

The final answer is 75."
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

To find the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the total cost to the change she received. Since she received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of friends James has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express Charlie's friends in terms of 'x' as 3x. 

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time it takes for each individual to get home, we must first convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to multiply the number of people by the number of tires and then add the results together.

For bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires = 10 tires, and 10 tires * 25 cents = $2.50
For tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires = 9 tires, and 9 tires * 25 cents = $2.25
For the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire = 1 tire, and 1 tire * 25 cents = $0.25

Now, let's add the amounts together: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the cookies, we can multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply the result by the cost per cookie.

First, we multiply 10 packs by 6 cookies/pack: 
10 * 6 = 60 cookies

Next, we multiply 60 cookies by $0.10/cookie: 
60 * 0.10 = $6

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

We know that ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. Then, 1/3 of 'x' is 6. To find 'x', we can multiply 6 by 3, which gives us 18. So, the raccoon ate 2/3 * 18 = 12 fries, and the remaining fries before the raccoon ate 18 - 12 = 6.

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries before the pigeons ate 6 + 9 = 15.

The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. Let's call the fries Dave ate 'y'. Then, the seagull ate y/2 fries. We know that the seagull ate 7 fries, so y/2 = 7. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us y = 14. Dave ate 14 fries.

Dave initially ate 14 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks: 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. There are 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.

Next, we'll calculate the total length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 24 inches long (since 1 foot = 12 inches). So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 24 = 1440 inches.

To find the total length of all the baked goods, we need to add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together. 

Total length = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.

Total length in feet = 3360 / 12
Total length in feet = 280 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must calculate the combined monthly requirement of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas require 400 bananas per month, and the baboons require 100 bananas per month. 

First, we add the monthly requirements: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break it down into individual components. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens: 4 pens at $1.5 each is 4 x $1.5 = $6.

Next, we have 2 notebooks at $4 each, which is 2 x $4 = $8.

Lastly, there's the cost of the bond paper, which is a single item at $20.

The total amount Raphael spent on everything is $34."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to consider the changes in the tadpole population.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, increasing the count. However, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, which decreases the count.

Let's calculate the net change in the tadpole population:

Increase: 6 tadpoles emerged
Decrease: 2 tadpoles hid

Net change: 6 - 2 = 4

Now, we add the net change to the initial count:
11 (initial tadpoles) + 4 (net change) = 15

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step:

The tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24 feet, we can multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $20
r = monthly interest rate = 20% / 12 = 0.01 (as a decimal)
n = number of periods = 36 months

A = 20(1 + 0.01)^36
A = 20(1.01)^36
A â‰ˆ 532.74

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $532.74.

The final answer is $532.74."
"To find the total cost of all toys, we need to establish the cost of each type of toy.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

"To determine the financial impact of hiring an accountant versus doing taxes oneself, we must consider the potential income loss and the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie were to do her taxes herself, she would lose 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of $35 per hour. This translates to a total loss of:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

In contrast, hiring an accountant costs $90.

To find the net gain from hiring the accountant, we subtract the cost from the potential loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie would have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the individual costs: 
â‚¬1090 + â‚¬157 = â‚¬1247
â‚¬1247 + â‚¬74 = â‚¬1321
â‚¬1321 + â‚¬102 = â‚¬1423

Elvira's budget is â‚¬1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

â‚¬1500 - â‚¬1423 = â‚¬77

Therefore, Elvira will have â‚¬77 left for her clothing."

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Seth's current age be x and Brooke's current age be y. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

x = 2y

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 2 + y + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

x + y + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x + y = 24

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

x = 2y
x + y = 24

We can solve for x by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

2y + y = 24

Combine like terms:

3y = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 8

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find x:

x = 2(8)
x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's represent the amount of money Ethel has as 'x'. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can write an equation:

2x + 2 = Jimmy's money

We are given that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

2(8) + 2 = Jimmy's money
16 + 2 = Jimmy's money
18 = Jimmy's money

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"To calculate the total miles walked in a week, we need to consider the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 5 days * 20 miles/day, which equals 100 miles. On weekends, he walks 2 days * 10 miles/day, which equals 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To calculate the total cost of each uniform, we need to consider the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. 

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"

Next, we'll multiply the number of insects by their legs: 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
Lastly, we'll multiply the number of rare mutant invertebrates by their legs: 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the information given as a system of linear equations with four variables: S32, S4, G, and T, where S32 represents the age of Sally Thirty-two, S4 represents the age of Sally Four, G represents the age of Granny Red, and T represents the age of Sally Two.

Let's start by writing the equations based on the given information:

1. S32 = 8 (since Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old)
2. S4 = S32 (since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two)
3. G = 2 * S4 (since Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four)
4. T = T + 3 (since Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red)

We can substitute the value of S32 into equation (2) to find S4:
S4 = S32
S4 = 8

Now, we can substitute the value of S4 into equation (3) to find G:
G = 2 * S4
G = 2 * 8
G = 16

Now that we have the value of G, we can substitute it into equation (4) to find T:
T = G + 3
T = 16 + 3
T = 19

Now that we have the values of all four variables, we can find the total age of the four birds:
Total age = S32 + S4 + G + T
Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19
Total age = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays per year, we need to first find the total amount she pays per month. 

The minimum payment for her student loans is $300, her credit card's minimum is $200, and her mortgage's minimum is $500. 

First, we add these amounts together: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000. 

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of $1000. 

50% of $1000 is 0.5 x $1000 = $500. 

Now, we add this 50% increase to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500. 

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12: $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to find the combined rate of peeling and cutting potatoes. 

First, we'll convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds.

The time to cut one potato is already given in seconds: 5 seconds.

The combined rate of peeling and cutting one potato is the sum of the individual rates: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Now, we multiply the combined rate by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

Converting the total time to minutes for easier understanding: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 95"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x' and the total cost of lemons and sugar as 'y'. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, and the selling price per glass is $0.50 with 20 glasses per gallon.

The total revenue is the selling price per glass multiplied by the number of glasses per gallon, which is 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon. The total revenue is also equal to the selling price per glass multiplied by the total number of glasses sold, which is 20x * $0.50 = 10x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 10x - y. We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

10x - y = 25

We also know that the total cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so we can set up another equation:

y = 5x

Now we have a system of two equations:

10x - y = 25
y = 5x

We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

10x - 5x = 25
5x = 25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 5

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons and sugar by substituting x into the equation y = 5x:

y = 5 * 5
y = 25

Since the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 * 5 = $25.

The final answer is $25."
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of Asians.

Total number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, there are 100 Chinese girls on the team."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. 

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. 

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$. 

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$. 

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$. 

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$. 

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. 

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of crabs each person has.

Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R. We know that:

B = 40 (given)
M = B - 4
R = M + 10

We can substitute the expression for M into the equation for R:
R = (B - 4) + 10
R = B + 6

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has:
B + M + R = 40 + (B - 4) + (B + 6)
Combine like terms:
B + M + R = 2B + 2

Substitute the expression for M:
B + (B - 4) + (B + 6) = 2B + 2
Combine like terms:
3B + 2 = 2B + 2

Subtract 2B from both sides:
B + 2 = 2

Subtract 2 from both sides:
B = 0

However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Bo cannot have 0 crabs. Let's re-examine the original equations.

The correct approach is to use the given information to find the correct value of B, then find M and R.

Given that B = 40, we can find M:
M = B - 4
M = 40 - 4
M = 36

Now, we can find R:
R = M + 10
R = 36 + 10
R = 46

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has:
B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46
B + M + R = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To calculate the total earnings for the first two weeks, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the hourly wage ($10) by the number of hours worked in each week: 
$10 * 5 = $50 (first week)
$10 * 8 = $80 (second week)

Next, we add the earnings from both weeks: 
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we can calculate the percentage of votes the winner received and subtract that from 100%. 

The winner received 3/4 of the total votes. To convert this to a percentage, we can divide 3 by 4 and multiply by 100:

(3/4) * 100 = 75%

Since the winner received 75% of the votes, the loser received the remaining percentage:

100% - 75% = 25%

Now, we can calculate the number of votes the loser got by multiplying the total number of votes by the percentage of votes the loser received:

Number of votes the loser got = 25% of 80
= (25/100) * 80
= 0.25 * 80
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x' and the number of red roses as '4x'. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. This gives us the equation:

5x = 200

Solving for x, we get:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Jan's age as J, Mark's age as M, and Jean's age as E.

From the problem statement, we have two pieces of information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark: E = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = (J/2) + 5

We can substitute the expression for E from the first equation into the second equation:

M - 2 = (J/2) + 5

Since we know Jan's age, we can substitute J = 30 into the equation:

M - 2 = (30/2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

E = M + 2
E = 22 + 2
E = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can analyze the time taken by each runner on the less well-rounded team. 

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. 

Let's denote the time taken by the first runner as x. Then, the time taken by the second runner is x - 3, the third runner is (x - 3) - 3 = x - 6, and the fourth runner is (x - 6) - 3 = x - 9.

The total time for the less well-rounded team is the sum of the individual times:
x + (x - 3) + (x - 6) + (x - 9) = 4x - 18

Since the well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

Now, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:
4x - 18 = 220

Solving for x, we get:
4x = 238
x = 59.5

Now that we know the time taken by the first runner, we can find the time taken by the subsequent runners:
Second runner: 59.5 - 3 = 56.5 seconds
Third runner: 56.5 - 3 = 53.5 seconds
Fourth runner: 53.5 - 3 = 50.5 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
59.5 + 56.5 + 53.5 + 50.5 = 220 seconds

The time difference between the two teams is:
220 - 220 = 0 seconds

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation for the less well-rounded team's total time is:
59.5 + 56.5 + 53.5 + 50.5 = 220 seconds

Since the well-rounded team's total time is 220 seconds, the time difference is actually 0 seconds. This indicates that the two teams are running at the same pace.

The correct answer is: 0"
"When Jerry rolls a six-sided die, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row separately.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row can be calculated by multiplying the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (1/2) by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 1/2), since the rolls are independent events. This gives us (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can represent this as a ratio: mom's apples : Jenna's apples = 2 : 1. 

We know that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, so we can multiply 20 by 2 to find the number of apples Jenna picked: 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom: 20 (mom's apples) + 40 (Jenna's apples) = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as x. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rats is 6(3x) = 18x.

We also know that the total number of straw used for rats is 90. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

18x = 90

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 90/18
x = 5

Since x represents the number of rats in each cage, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x. The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation, which is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Combine like terms:

8x = 400

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is given as $66.

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to convert the hours to minutes and then multiply by the number of peaches he can collect per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. 

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is 360."
"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we need to divide the total weekly requirement by 7.

The total weekly requirement is 3.5 pounds. 

To find the daily requirement, we can divide 3.5 by 7.

3.5 Ã· 7 = 0.5

Therefore, the daily insect requirement for the flock of ten ducks is 0.5 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years. Since he plants 10 trees a year, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Next, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down in 10 years. Since he chops down 2 trees a year, we multiply 2 by 10:

2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees

Now, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Finally, we calculate 30% of the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the change Violetta will receive, we need to determine the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount she has.

Since Violetta needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has:

Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. 

The cost of a pen is the sum of these two values: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

The cost of 8 pens can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8: 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to consider the total amount of carrots available and the amount distributed to each restaurant.

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds. To find the total amount distributed, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each receives:

40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount that will not be used:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

1. Start with the total population: 23786
2. Subtract the number of men: 23786 - 8417 = 15369
3. Subtract the number of women: 15369 - 9092 = 6237

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6237."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of cards collected in the first month. Since she collected three times the number of cards she initially had, we multiply the initial number of cards by 3: 20 * 3 = 60 cards.

Next, we determine the number of cards collected in the second month. She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so we subtract 20 from the first month's total: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Then, we calculate the number of cards collected in the third month. She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. To do this, we add the first and second month's totals and then multiply by 2: (60 + 40) * 2 = 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The total number of cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x and the rate per sentence for Publisher A as y. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can set up the equation:

x = 500

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 5x. Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2y. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 2y * 500. The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts he makes from both publishers:

5x + 2y * 500 = 7500

Substituting x = 500 into the equation, we get:

5(500) + 2y * 500 = 7500

2500 + 1000y = 7500

Subtracting 2500 from both sides:

1000y = 5000

Dividing both sides by 1000:

y = 5

Now that we know the rate per sentence for Publisher A, we can find the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A:

5x = 5 * 500 = 2500

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts he makes from both publishers:

2500 + 5000 = 7500

The final answer is: 7500"
"To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to multiply the number of pails he gets in the morning by the number of liters per pail, then multiply the number of pails he gets in the afternoon by the number of liters per pail, and finally add the two results together.

First, we multiply the morning pails by the liters per pail: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Next, we multiply the afternoon pails by the liters per pail: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters
Finally, we add the two results together: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Since the award is a one-time monetary reward, we can add it directly to his total earnings. However, we need to calculate the raise first. A 5% raise on his current salary would be:

$2000 * 0.05 = $100

Now, we add the raise to his current salary:

$2000 + $100 = $2100

Finally, we add the award amount to his new salary:

$2100 + $5000 = $7100

However, this is his new weekly salary. To find his total earnings for the year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:

$7100 * 52 = $367,400

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $367,400.

Final answer: $367,400"
"To calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons/acre, which equals 50 tons. Then, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton, resulting in 100 barrels.

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down his cheese consumption into separate categories and calculate the total amount.

Carl's lunch consumption consists of 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he ate a sandwich every day for 7 days. This results in a total of 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese used for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, the total number of slices used for breakfast is 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Additionally, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue pens: 6 bags with 9 pens in each bag, so 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens: 2 bags with 6 pens in each bag, so 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens together:
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score on the sixth test, we can use the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the unknown score as x. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we'll assume the lowest score is 71. The sum of the remaining scores is 438 - 71 = 367.

We want the average of the six tests to be 93. The sum of the six tests should be 93 multiplied by 6, which is 558. Since the lowest score is removed, the sum of the remaining five scores (including the unknown score x) should be 558. 

We can set up the equation: 
367 + x = 558

Now, we can solve for x: 
x = 558 - 367
x = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two separate periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first period. Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. We can multiply the number of times he rode per week by the number of weeks to get the total number of times he rode, then multiply that by the distance he rode each time.

5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers/time = 500 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the second period. Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. Again, we multiply the number of times he rode per week by the number of weeks to get the total number of times he rode, then multiply that by the distance he rode each time.

2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers/time = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated by multiplying the weight of one chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the cost of one cup is 'x'. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, the cost of 20 dozen cups can be expressed as 20 * 12 * x.

We are given that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is 3 * $6000. This can be written as:

20 * 12 * x = 3 * 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240x = 18000 - 1200
240x = 16800

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 240:

x = 16800 / 240
x = 70

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items:
Jacket: $30
Shoes: $20 x 2 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn:
$70 - $10 = $60

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session, we can set up an equation to find the number of babysitting sessions:
5x = 60
x = 60 / 5
x = 12

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60. To do this, we can set up another equation:
4y = 60
y = 60 / 4
y = 15

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method. We'll represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we need to find the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50), which equals 100 + 150. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the third day. Since the total number of customers on the third day was 500, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round down to 133. However, we can also find the exact number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to the number of customers on the first day:

x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150

The total number of customers on the first two days is 250, and the total number of customers on the third day is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we can subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, the correct answer is 250."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the following system of equations:

x - 16 = y ... (1)
2x - 16 = 4y ... (2)

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging equation (1), we get x = y + 16.

Substituting x = y + 16 into equation (2), we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y
2y + 32 - 16 = 4y
2y + 16 = 4y
16 = 2y
y = 8

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into equation (1): x = y + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24.

Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we can divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage.

Total cost = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 Ã· $8.00 = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

Final answer: 44"
"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she needs to pay and subtract the total payments made.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of the initial amount. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay:

Total amount paid = $165 x 12 = $1980

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount:

Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

The number of roses is 4. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of flowers is the sum of roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can start by determining their current ages. 

Let's denote Harriet's age as H, Zack's age as Z, and Adrian's age as A. We are given that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can express this as an equation: H = (1/2)Z. We also know that Harriet is 21 years old, so H = 21. Substituting this value into the first equation, we can solve for Zack's age: 21 = (1/2)Z, which gives us Z = 42.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can express this as another equation: A = 3H. Substituting the value of H, we get A = 3(21) = 63.

Now that we have their current ages, we can find their ages in three years: H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24, Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45, and A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by determining the points scored by the other three students.

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, Brianna's points as B, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68.

Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so we can express Yuri's points as Y = (1/2)N + 10. Substituting N = 68, we get Y = (1/2)(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so B = N + 17. Substituting N = 68, we get B = 68 + 17 = 85.

Now, we can find the total points scored by the three students: N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points: J = 251 - 197 = 54.

The final answer is 54."
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

Time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated by multiplying the number of puzzles (3) by the time spent on each puzzle (10 minutes), which gives us 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Time spent on sudoku puzzles can be calculated by multiplying the number of puzzles (8) by the time spent on each puzzle (5 minutes), which gives us 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles (30 minutes) and sudoku puzzles (40 minutes), which gives us 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Next, we need to calculate the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice the amount left in the tank.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we'll find the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums: 90 - 40 = 50.

Next, we'll add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of $15,000.

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each individual and then add them together.

Carlos' cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the boat (3) by the hourly rate ($30). This gives us 3 * 30 = 90.

Benji's cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the raft (5) by the hourly rate ($18). This gives us 5 * 18 = 90.

Now, we add the costs together: 90 + 90 = 180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. 
The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The final answer is 9."
"To calculate the probability of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to consider the individual components and their respective costs.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. Additionally, he selects 2 sauces for $0.25 each, totaling $0.50. The upgrade to his meal adds $3.00.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the upgrade:
$6.50 (base burrito) + $2.00 (extra meat) = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 (extra cheese) = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 (avocado) = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 (2 sauces) = $11.00

Now, we add the upgrade cost to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. To find the final amount owed, we subtract the gift card value from the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, and her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can find the time it takes to complete the puzzle by dividing the total number of pieces by the combined rate.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we first need to calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially. 

We can find 30% of 120 by multiplying 0.3 and 120.

0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining after the initial harvest. 

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Then, we calculate 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

Now, we need to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest. 

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars. Since Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, we can multiply the number of cars by the cost per car:

12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%, so we'll multiply the cost of the cars by 0.10:

$240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the registration fees. Mark pays $1,000 for each of the 12 cars, so we'll multiply the number of cars by the registration fee:

12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Finally, we'll add up the three components to find the total cost:

$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of shells she collected on Monday and then multiply it by 2.

Since Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can find the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday by adding 5 to 20. This gives us 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

Now, we multiply the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday (25) by 2 to find the number of shells she collects on Tuesday. This gives us 25 * 2 = 50 shells.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the concept of equivalent ratios. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio: bugs:ants = 1:2. Given that there are 50 ants, we can multiply this ratio by 50 to find the number of bugs.

bugs = 50 * (1/2)
bugs = 25

Now, we can add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = bugs + ants
= 25 + 50
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine the number of penguins that went in each direction and then subtract that from the initial number.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines needed, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes required per week. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he consumes 6 tomatoes daily, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

As Steve's girlfriend consumes half of this amount, her weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find the number of vines required to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To calculate the number of vines needed, we can divide the total number of tomatoes required by the number of tomatoes produced per vine:

42 tomatoes/week Ã· 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato requirements.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must consider the total number of slices required and the number of slices per pizza. Since there are 20 friends, each needing 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Given that pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each friend receives at least 4 slices. 

To do this, we divide 80 by 8: 80 Ã· 8 = 10. 

Since the result is a whole number, we don't need to round up. However, in this case, we must consider that 10 pizzas would provide 80 slices, but it's not possible to have a fraction of a pizza. Therefore, John needs to order 11 pizzas to ensure each friend gets at least 4 slices.

The correct answer is 11."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram will have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from the 25 pens. Since he can make one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can calculate the number of full pens he can make by dividing 25 by 5.

25 Ã· 5 = 5

This means Ram can create 5 full pens. Since he starts with 25 pens, and all of them are used to make the new pens, the total number of pens he will have is equal to the number of full pens he can make.

Therefore, Ram will have 5 pens.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can break it down into two steps:

First, we add the initial $20 to the additional $10, resulting in a total of $30.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can represent their ages as variables and set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as (J + 5) - 2.

We know Jessa's age is 20, so J = 20.

Now, we can substitute J into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages:
Joan's age = J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age = (J + 5) - 2 = 20 + 5 - 2 = 23

The sum of their ages is J + (J + 5) + ((J + 5) - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we find 30% of 1000, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students. These students left through exit A.

Next, we subtract the students who left through A from the total number of students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining.

Then, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining students, which is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students. These students left through exit B.

Finally, we subtract the students who left through B from the remaining students: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's represent the number of candies Robert has as 'x'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2x.

We are also told that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2x = 54.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 27. This means Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can express James' candies as x + 6. Substituting the value of x, we get James' candies as 27 + 6 = 33.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can consider the books they have and the books they will read from each other.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, and she will also read 2 books from her own book. Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, and she will also read 1 book from her own book.

The total number of books Dolly will read is 2 (from Pandora) + 2 (from her own) = 4 books.

The total number of books Pandora will read is 1 (from Dolly) + 1 (from her own) = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the correct answer is 6."
"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of letters written per week. Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, the total number of letters received is 3 * 2 = 6. As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters written per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing per week by multiplying the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60: 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss and the extra minutes he had.

First, we multiply the daily minutes used for his call with his boss by the number of days in the month: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we add the extra minutes he had: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. 

Billy then took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We also know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

Additionally, we can express the number of snails in each aquarium as 4 + x and 32 - x, respectively. The difference between these two expressions is 28, so we can set up another equation:

(4 + x) - (32 - x) = 28

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4 + x - 32 + x = 28
-28 + 2x = 28
2x = 56
x = 28

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of fish in each aquarium. Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 28 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 28"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $30,000: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by adding the individual costs together.

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) = $55
$55 + $15 (decorations) = $70
$70 + $4 (invitations) = $74
$74 + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of people to find the cost per person. There are 3 people in total.

$96 Ã· 3 = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula: Total Cost = Number of Bags * Weight per Bag * Cost per Pound.

Given:
Number of Bags = 4
Weight per Bag = 50 pounds
Cost per Pound = $1.50

Total Cost = 4 * 50 * $1.50
Total Cost = 4 * 75
Total Cost = 300

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, we can find the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday by multiplying her sister's cookies by 4.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, we can find the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday by multiplying her sister's cookies by 2.

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister. We can do this by adding the number of cookies each of them ate.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since we know that 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister by multiplying the total number of cookies by 200.

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Finally, we need to find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister. We can do this by subtracting the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we can start by using the information that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of students in the school is equally divided between boys and girls.

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60 students.

Given that the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Now, we can find the number of boys in the first two classes by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in those classes: 15 + 12 = 27 boys.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we need to consider the changes in the number of apps.

Travis initially had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, which reduces the total by 9. To find the new total after deletion, we subtract 9 from 61:

61 - 9 = 52

Next, Travis downloaded 18 more apps, which increases the total by 18. To find the final total, we add 18 to 52:

52 + 18 = 70

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves Rick killed today. We know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars today. So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Next, we need to find the total number of wolves Rick killed. We know he killed 10 wolves last night and 36 wolves today. So, the total number of wolves is 10 + 36 = 46.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals Rick killed. We know he killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night, and 12 cougars today. So, the total number of cougars is 15 + 12 = 27.

Finally, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply his starting floor (3) by 4, which gives us 12. Then, we add 6 to the result, yielding 18.

"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

Now, we subtract this value from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply 21 by 4 to find the number of times Robert went down the slide: 21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (20) and then multiply the result by the number of stalls we're interested in (8).

First, let's find the number of cows each stall gets:
40 new cows Ã· 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall

Now, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls we're interested in:
2 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 16 cows

The final answer is 16."
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to consider the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

First, let's calculate the total value of the coins:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values of the coins together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5

Next, we add the value of the dollar bills: $5 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can multiply the height of the tree (in feet) by the weight of each section to find the total weight:

200 feet * 400 pounds/foot = 80,000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

80,000 pounds * 0.3 = 24,000 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

80,000 pounds - 24,000 pounds = 56,000 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 56,000 pounds.

Final answer: 56,000"

First, multiply 8 by 0.50: 8 * 0.50 = 4.00

Next, add the flat fee of $2.00: 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of bananas as B.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

A = B + 8  (Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
B = A - 4  (Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute A = 52 into the first equation:
52 = B + 8

Now, we can solve for B:
B = 52 - 8
B = 44

Now that we know B, we can find A using the second equation:
A = B - 4
A = 44 - 4
A = 40

However, we are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so our initial assumption that A = 52 must be incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the system of equations.

Since A = B + 8 and B = A - 4, we can substitute B = A - 4 into the first equation:
A = (A - 4) + 8
A = A + 4
Subtracting A from both sides gives us:
0 = 4
This is a contradiction, indicating that the initial assumption that A = 52 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the system of equations. We can rewrite the second equation as:
B = A - 4

Substituting B = A - 4 into the first equation:

A = B + 8

Since 2 cups of flour are required for every 12 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the total amount of flour needed:

66 Ã· 12 = 5.5

Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find two thirds of 9,300 pennies, we can multiply 9,300 by the fraction 2/3. 

First, we multiply 9,300 by 2, which gives us 18,600. Then, we divide 18,600 by 3 to get 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by $0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

The number of boxes is 5, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply 5 by 50, which equals 250.

Next, we add the 20 marbles Maddison received from her friend to the total number of marbles in the boxes. This gives us 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees by dividing Chris's trees by 2. This gives us 6 / 2 = 3 trees for Ferdinand.

Next, we're told that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find Harry's trees, we first calculate twice the number of Ferdinand's trees, which is 2 * 3 = 6. Then, we add 5 to this result, giving us 6 + 5 = 11 trees for Harry.

Now, to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"The art of addition is a fundamental aspect of mathematics, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem with precision.

Let's break it down step by step:

We have three individuals with varying amounts of money: Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy. Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, which translates to $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy, on the other hand, has $50 more than Samantha, resulting in $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find the total amount of money the girls have combined, we simply add the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175.

The sum of these amounts is $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to find the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. 

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, we calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is $12,000. Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is $20,000. The total amount paid is the sum of these two fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $368,000."
"To calculate the total time, we need to break down the problem into its components. 

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. The initial heating time is 20 minutes, and it takes 40% longer to reach the desired temperature. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat up the oil, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we add the heating time and cooking time to get the total time. The total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50). This gives us a total of $250.

Next, we calculate the total amount spent on television ads by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15), resulting in a total of $1125.

Finally, we add the cost of newspaper ads ($250) and television ads ($1125) to find the total amount spent on all ads. This gives us a grand total of $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we must consider the total number of balls and the proportion of golf balls within that total. 

First, we divide the total number of balls by 2 to find the number of golf balls: 16 Ã· 2 = 8.

Next, we take the number of golf balls and divide by 2 to find the number of blue golf balls: 8 Ã· 2 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we can break down the problem into steps.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as x. We know that the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so the number of M&Ms in the second bag is x + 12. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so the number of M&Ms in the third bag is x/2.

We are given that the first bag has 300 M&Ms, so x = 300. Now we can substitute this value into the expressions for the second and third bags:

Number of M&Ms in the second bag: x + 12 = 300 + 12 = 312
Number of M&Ms in the third bag: x/2 = 300/2 = 150

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows separately.

First, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows.

Next, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the change, we need to find the total cost of the items purchased. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual item prices: 
Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

The change given to the mother is $4.01."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps. Let's start by finding the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, we can set up the equation:

Collar stitches = (1/10) * Body stitches
Collar stitches = (1/10) * 900
Collar stitches = 90

Next, we know that the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, we can set up the equation:

Rosette stitches = 2 * Collar stitches
Rosette stitches = 2 * 90
Rosette stitches = 180

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we can set up the equation:

Total stitches = Body stitches + Collar stitches + Rosette stitches + Sleeve stitches
1800 = 900 + 90 + 180 + Sleeve stitches
Sleeve stitches = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180
Sleeve stitches = 630

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

Sleeve stitches = 630 / 2
Sleeve stitches = 315

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet. To multiply 20 by 40, we can break it down as 10 * 40, which equals 400. Then, we multiply the result by 2, which equals 800.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet. To multiply 80 by 30, we can break it down as 60 * 30, which equals 1800. Then, we multiply the result by 1.2 (or 80/70), which equals 1920.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $1920 = $2720.

The final answer is: $2720"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so we need to divide 108 by 3 to find the number of lines he has from the first scene: 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so we multiply 60 by 4/5 to find the number of lines he has from the second scene: 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter A: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

After that, we determine the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter B: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Now, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can use the concept of rate and quantity. 

Let's break it down:

- Time to dig a small hole: 3 minutes
- Time to dig a large hole: 10 minutes
- Number of small holes: 30
- Number of large holes: 15

First, we calculate the total time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Next, we calculate the total time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for small holes and large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"The art of addition is a fundamental aspect of mathematics, and I'm delighted to dive into this problem.

When two individuals, Mico and Marco, come together, their combined ages can be represented as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote Mico's age as M and Marco's age as C. We're given that the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be expressed as:

M + C = 20

Now, let's fast-forward 10 years. Mico's age will increase by 10, and Marco's age will also increase by 10. To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both M and C:

M + 10 + C + 10

Combining like terms, we get:

M + C + 20

Since we know that M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

20 + 20

The sum of their ages in 10 years is therefore 40.

**The final answer is 40.**"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations. Let R represent Ruby's current age and S represent Sam's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can rewrite the second equation to make it easier to work with:
R + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the rewritten equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Next, we'll isolate the variable S by subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles can be found by multiplying 20 (the number of popsicles) by $0.25 (the cost per popsicle), which equals $5.

The cost of the ice cream bars can be found by multiplying 4 (the number of ice cream bars) by $0.50 (the cost per ice cream bar), which equals $2.

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots, we first need to calculate the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

We are given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. To find the total number of spots, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on a cobra and add it to the product of the number of mambas and the number of spots on a mamba.

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24

Total number of people: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed. 

39 Ã· 3 = 13

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of beads as 'x'. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can set up the equation:

8 + 17 = x/4

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

8(4) + 17(4) = x
32 + 68 = x
100 = x

Therefore, Katerina uses 100 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 100"
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to consider the number of stories each child wrote in the first week and double it for the second week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can start by finding his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Current age of brother = 9 * 2 = 18 years

Next, we add 3 to his current age to find his age in 3 years.

Age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To calculate the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we need to consider the value of her coins. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents. 

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. 

To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we can find the number of trucks needed by dividing the total weight by the truck's capacity.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we must first calculate its speed. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as follows:

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the total number of medals given out for counting. Since Ali and Izzy together have 39 medals, we can set up the equation:

x = 10(22 + 17)

This equation represents the fact that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 10(39)
x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we determine the number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is 2."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to consider the total time she works and her earnings per minute. 

First, let's calculate the total minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she takes a 30-minute break. To find the actual working time, we subtract the break time from the total minutes. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings by dividing the working time by 10 and multiplying by her earnings per minute. 150 / 10 = 15. Then, 15 * $5 = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we need to calculate their points before and after the extra point distribution.

Initially, we know:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, all players receive an extra point if they have more than 20 points. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will receive an extra point each.

- Mike's points after the extra point: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points after the extra point: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points after the extra point: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Will buys 15 oranges. Then, he asks his sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, the youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

In total, the sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"To calculate the total count of activities, we need to find the number of each activity on both days and add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg Ã· 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of crates sold, we need to consider the sales over the weekend and the sales from Tuesday to Thursday.

First, let's add the crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates.

Next, we'll add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates.

Now, we'll combine the weekend sales with the weekday sales: 20 + 45 = 65 crates.

To find the difference between the target and the actual sales, we'll subtract the total crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is 55."
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. So, the bids were $200, $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids were $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350, so we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $650

However, we also need to add the cost of the bids made by the other 3 people. 

$50 (first bid) + $50 (second bid) + $50 (third bid) = $150

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen's last bid. 

$650 + $150 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to consider the total miles driven and the associated costs.

First, we calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the cost of driving plus the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can observe a pattern. 

When folding a piece of paper, we create two identical halves. Each half has 16 pages. Since we have two halves, we need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

However, this calculation assumes that each page is printed on both sides. Since the problem doesn't specify this, we can consider the pages as being printed on one side only. In this case, we need 32 pieces of paper.

But, if we consider the pages as being printed on both sides, we need 32 pieces of paper.

Since the problem doesn't specify whether the pages are printed on both sides or one side, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on the most common assumption that pages are printed on both sides, the answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To find the amount of money Annika has left, we need to subtract the total money she spent from the initial amount. 

Annika brought $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides. 

The total money spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The amount of money Annika has left is $15."
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, we can express the number of books sold in the first year as 2y, where y is the number of books sold in the current year.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200. So, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 200

We also know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. Since we already know that x + y = 200, we can also express this as:

2y + 45 = 200

Now, we can solve for y:

2y = 200 - 45
2y = 155
y = 155/2
y = 77.5

Since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of y to find the total amount of money earned in the second year.

The number of books sold in the second year is y = 77.5. Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 77.5 * 20 = 1550.

The final answer is: $1550"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we need to consider his hourly wage and the bonus he receives.

Watson earns $10 per hour and works for 10 hours each day. Since there are 4 weeks in April, he works a total of 5 days a week * 4 weeks = 20 days.

His daily earnings can be calculated as 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day.

To find his total earnings for the month, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works: $100/day * 20 days = $2000.

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the month. Therefore, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 x 0.2, as 80% is equivalent to 0.8.

20 x 0.8 = 16

Therefore, John lost to 16 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 loaves can be found by multiplying 60 by 2/3, which equals 40 loaves.

Next, we determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales. This is calculated by subtracting the morning sales from the total number of loaves: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Finally, we find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2: 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week. Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Let's say the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey is x. We can set up the proportion:

2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated by subtracting the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. This is because the person will grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days.

Since the person drinks the serum for 15 days, we can divide 15 by both 3 and 5 to find the number of complete cycles. 

15 / 3 = 5 (complete cycles of 3 days)
15 / 5 = 3 (complete cycles of 5 days)

Since there are no remaining days after 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the amount Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 * $100 = $600. Next, we'll calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 * $50 = $150. Then, we'll find the cost of the flight ticket, which is 5 times the cost of a business suit: 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we'll add up the total cost of the items purchased: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we'll subtract the total cost of items purchased from his total budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we need to subtract that from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day. This can be done by multiplying 3 (the number of people) by 3 (the number of eggs each person eats per day), which gives us 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.

Next, we'll calculate the total eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day. This can be done by multiplying 2 (the number of people) by 2 (the number of eggs each person eats per day), which gives us 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, we'll add the total eggs consumed by both groups to find the overall daily consumption. 9 (eggs from the three people) + 4 (eggs from the two people) = 13 eggs per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we'll multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week. 13 eggs per day x 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn using a system of linear equations. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

We are given the following information:

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane: T = J + 5
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: J = Q - 3
3. Quinn is 30 years old: Q = 30

We can substitute the value of Q into the second equation to find Jane's age: J = 30 - 3 = 27

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the first equation to find Trent's age: T = 27 + 5 = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. We are given that Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was 40. Since we know Noah's current age, we can confirm that N = 46.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. This translates to the equation:

P - 6 = 3000 * 40

To find the current population of Chile, we need to solve for P. First, we can simplify the equation:

P - 6 = 120000

Next, we add 6 to both sides of the equation to isolate P:

P = 120000 + 6
P = 120006

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 120006.

The final answer is: 120006"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of players on the defense be x. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool first. The pool is a rectangular prism with dimensions of 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in height. The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Volume (V) = Length (L) * Width (W) * Height (H)
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since the cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can write the equation: G = 3B.

We are also given that the classroom has 30 boys, so B = 30.

Substituting B = 30 into the equation G = 3B, we get G = 3(30) = 90.

Additionally, we know that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we can write the equation: N = (1/10)B.

Substituting B = 30 into the equation N = (1/10)B, we get N = (1/10)(30) = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires. Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, so we can write the proportion as:

x / 3 = 1 / 45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x * 45 = 1 * 3

x * 45 = 3

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 3 / 45

x = 1 / 15

x = 1/15

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

x = 0 with a remainder of 1

x = 0 1/15

x = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total number of people at the party. We know that 25 men and 15 women were initially present. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = number of people who left

We also know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is:
25 - 22 = 3 men

Since 3 men left, and 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up another equation:
3 = 1/4 * x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:
x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people, we can find the number of women who left:
Number of women who left = 1/4 * 12 = 3 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 3 = 12 women

However, we are asked to find the number of women left if 22 men stayed at the party. Since 3 men left, and we know the total number of people, we can find the number of women who left in terms of the total number of people:
Number of women who left = 1/4 * x
Number of women left = 1/4 * (12 - 3)
Number of women left = 1/4 * 9
Number of women left = 2.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also express the answer as a fraction of the total number of women who were initially present.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"The cost of the magazine is half the cost of the book. Since the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine by dividing $4 by 2, which equals $2.

Now, we know the magazine costs $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we subtract $1 from $2, resulting in $1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils. Assuming each box has 24 pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

Let's start by finding the rate at which the coffee cools. We know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. To find the rate of cooling, we can divide the amount of weakening (12 milliliters) by the amount of cooling (13 degrees). This gives us a rate of 12/13 milliliters per degree.

Now, we can use this rate to find the total weakening caused by the cooling. The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, so we multiply the rate of cooling (12/13 milliliters per degree) by the amount of cooling (65 degrees) to get:

(12/13) * 65 = 60 milliliters

This means that the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker due to the cooling.

Next, we need to find the weakening caused by the added cream. We know that 15 milliliters of cream are added, which will weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening caused by the cooling (60 milliliters) and the weakening caused by the added cream (15 milliliters):

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as x. Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can set up the equation:

2x = 7

This equation represents the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7/2
x = 3.5

However, since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 3

Since each person brought in 3 old records, and there are 5 people, the total number of old records brought in is:

3 * 5 = 15

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 15 old records.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Let's start by finding the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the total number of employees is 100, we can set up the equation:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= (2 * 100) / 5
= 200 / 5
= 40

Now that we know the number of junior programmers, we can find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and the salary of senior programmers is $400 more than that, so:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000
= $80,000 per month

Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400
= $144,000 per month

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can start by considering the number of people who got on at each stop. At the first stop, 5 people got on. Then, at the second stop, 8 more people got on, and 7 people got off.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. We know that x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 6 = 20.

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get x = 14.

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Next, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To calculate the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

We know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find the time it will take to charge 40%, we can set up a proportion:

1% / 3 minutes = 40% / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

x = (40% * 3 minutes) / 1%
x = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we add the initial number of lollipops Erin has to the number her mother gives her. This results in 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, we subtract the number of lollipops Erin gives to Ella from the total. This yields 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The correct answer is: 14"
"To find the amount the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the two options, Job B provides a higher net pay of $32,400.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the amount of sugar required for suckers and fudge, and then adding those amounts together.

For suckers, we multiply the number of batches (8) by the amount of sugar per batch (30 ounces). This gives us 8 * 30 = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge, which is simply 1 batch * 70 ounces = 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amounts together: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we need to apply the percentage changes to the initial value of each share.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year: 50% of $8 is $4. So, the value after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 is $3. So, the value after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Since Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can multiply 2 by 3 to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate: 2 * 3 = 6.

Next, we know that John ate half the amount Thomas ate. To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we can divide 6 by 2: 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of students in the smallest group be x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of cows as x and the number of chickens as 2x, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of chickens:

2x = 2(20) = 40

Now that we know the number of cows (20) and chickens (40), we can find the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we can analyze the pattern of his juggling act. He starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. 

Let's break it down:

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since the talent show begins at the end of the fourth week, Josh has 6 balls. However, he drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. 

To find the final number of balls, we subtract the lost ball: 6 - 1 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container as F, B, T, S, R, and C, respectively.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. F = B (the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle)
2. F = T (the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad)
3. F = S - 10 (the pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake)
4. F = R + 20 (the pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird)
5. C = 20 (the container weighs 20 pounds)

We can substitute equations (1) and (2) into equation (3) to get:
B = T = S - 10

We can also substitute equation (1) and (2) into equation (4) to get:
B = R + 20

Now, we can equate the expressions for B from equations (3) and (4):
S - 10 = R + 20

Rearranging this equation, we get:
R = S - 30

Now, we can substitute this expression for R into equation (4):
F = (S - 30) + 20
F = S - 10

Since F = S - 10 and F = 50, we can equate the two expressions:
50 = S - 10
S = 60

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the values of R and B:
R = S - 30
R = 60 - 30
R = 30

B = S - 10
B = 60 - 10
B = 50

Now that we have the values of F, B, S, and R, we can find the total weight:
Total weight = F + B + T + S + C
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 60 + 60 + 20
Total weight = 240

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits given by Laurel's friend, the new outfits received at the baby shower, and the outfits gifted by her mom.

We can break this down into steps:

1. First, we'll multiply the number of outfits given by Laurel's friend by 2 to find the number of outfits received at the baby shower: 24 * 2 = 48
2. Next, we'll add the number of outfits given by Laurel's friend (24) to the number of outfits received at the baby shower (48): 24 + 48 = 72
3. Finally, we'll add the number of outfits gifted by her mom (15) to the total: 72 + 15 = 87

Therefore, the total number of outfits is 87."
"To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to first determine the increased daily distance. The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters than his original 5000 meters. 

To find 1/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which equals 1000. Therefore, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"The prices of the juice boxes are as follows:

Juice Box A is $4.
Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9.
Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.

To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C.

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

Final Answer: $2"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. 

First, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table for each type of table, and then add the results.

40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to find 40% of the original price of one shirt and then subtract that from the original price.

First, find 40% of $30:
40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:
$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:
$18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the current and past periods.

The factory sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos at $220 each, generating a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: 10"
"To calculate the total amount spent on the dog per year, we need to consider the monthly expenses. 

First, we calculate the weekly cost of food: $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20. Then, we add the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. 

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220. 

To find the total amount spent per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to multiply and add the hours for each activity.

First, we'll multiply the hours for Tuesday's cooking class by 3, since it's three times as long as Monday's yoga class. This gives us 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we'll add the hours for Monday's yoga class (1 hour), Tuesday's cooking class (3 hours), and Wednesday's cheese-tasting event (0.5 hours). This gives us 1 + 3 + 0.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we'll add the hours for Thursday's museum tour (half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours) to the previous total. This gives us 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Finally, we'll add the hours for Friday's errands (2 hours) to the previous total. This gives us 6 + 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can calculate the number of pots for the roses by multiplying the number of pots for the daisies by 2. 

The number of pots for the daisies is 30. Therefore, the number of pots for the roses is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we add the number of pots for the daisies and roses to find the total number of pots needed: 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find the amount Andrea saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent and gave away from the initial amount she had.

The initial amount Andrea had was $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. 

First, we add the amount spent and given away: $11 + $4 = $15

Now, we subtract this total from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

First, we calculate the time spent swimming, which is half the time spent boating. Since John spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the activities that were not sightseeing. John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we add the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours, resulting in $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, earning $75. 

Her total earnings are $200 + $75 = $275. Adding her initial savings of $80, we get $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shortest trees. This is simply the sum of their heights: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we know the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees. So, we multiply the combined height by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To calculate the total amount of money Dean has left, we need to consider the initial amount of money he had, the cost of the items he purchased, and the additional amount given by his mother.

The initial amount of money Dean had is $28. The cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. The cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

To find the total amount of money Dean has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money: $28 - $17 = $11.

However, his mother then gave him an extra $10. To find the final amount, we add this to the remaining amount: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 Ã· $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total amount Marisa saves, we need to find the difference between her daily pocket money and the total cost of lollipops.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since she saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

The final amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank for 5 days is $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the known value of the gumballs. 

First, we know that Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have had $8 initially. Since he spent $1.5 on candy, he must have had $8 - $1.5 = $6.5 left.

Since Billy had $6.5 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide $6.5 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be written as C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:
50/2 = S
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between services, we first need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days, or 0.375 days, or 37.5 days, or 37.5 days."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. This can be calculated by taking the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds). 

The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the amounts required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to break it down into three parts: the trip to his friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time taken for the detour. The distance is 10 miles and the speed is 70 mph. Again, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Finally, we add up the times for each part of the trip to get the total time taken.

Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the total number of absent students. We know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. 

Total absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Now, we subtract the total absent students from the total number of students.

Number of boys present = Total students - Total absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

Therefore, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 87."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can represent the number of boys as 2 times the number of girls. 

Let's denote the number of girls as 'g'. Then, the number of boys is 2g. We know that the total number of kids is the sum of the number of boys and girls. 

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 2g + g
Total number of kids = 3g

We are given that there are 6 girls in the park. So, we can substitute g = 6 into the equation:

Total number of kids = 3g
Total number of kids = 3 * 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to consider the total points required for promotion and the points she has already scored.

The total points required for promotion is 42. Jane has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

42 (total required points) - 33 (points scored so far) = 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as y, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as z.

We are given the following system of equations:

x + y + z = 50 (total number of customers kicked out)
y = 4x - 5 (number of customers kicked out for shoplifting)
z = 3y (number of customers kicked out for physical violence)

We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

x + (4x - 5) + z = 50

We can also substitute the expression for z from the third equation into the above equation:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 4

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the values of y and z:

y = 4x - 5
y = 4(4) - 5
y = 11

z = 3y
z = 3(11)
z = 33

Since the question asks for the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 4 - 11 - 33 = 12

Therefore, the correct answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Sara had x points before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + 8

This is because Erin scored 8 points, and we want to find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 8 points. 

Now, we can simplify the equation:

3x = 22

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 7.33
Erin's points before = 22. 

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8 points. This means Erin must have had 0 points before scoring 8 points.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into categories and calculate each separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and 20% of this cost needs to be added for etching. 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $20 + $4 = $24 per frame. With 44 frames, the total cost is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, we have the cost of the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins at $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items: $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1198."
"To calculate the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to find 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

First, let's calculate 20% of $400:
20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost:
$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To calculate the total number of shoes sold, we need to consider the sales for each day and account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

The hours for Tuesday and Thursday are given as 1 hour and 2 hours, respectively. Since Saturday's practice is twice as long as Tuesday's, we can calculate it as 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week."
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to find the number of functioning pieces and then multiply it by the cost per piece.

First, let's find the number of functioning pieces. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, the remaining 60% is functioning. 

Number of functioning pieces = 60% of 400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000 = 240,000

Now, we multiply the number of functioning pieces by the total amount spent to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces:
Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000 * $400,000 / 400,000
Total amount spent on functioning pieces = $240,000

Final answer: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break it down into two parts. 

First, we have 15 sheep that yield 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from these sheep is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

Next, we have the remaining 15 sheep that yield 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from these sheep is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both groups: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to find the number of rolls remaining after feeding her 6 children. This can be calculated by subtracting 6 from the initial number of rolls: 12 - 6 = 6.

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces created by breaking the remaining rolls into 8 pieces each. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by 8: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size. This can be calculated as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we can calculate this as (40 - 20) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. This means the total number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

We also know that on Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Let's call the number of apples picked on Tuesday 'x'. Then, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is 2x.

We are given that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday, so we can set up the equation: x = 12.

Now, we can find the number of apples picked on Wednesday: 2x = 2 * 12 = 24.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to consider the total number of socks she has washed and the total number of socks that need washing.

Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. 

The total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

Next, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total: 65 - 44 = 21.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of payments

In this case, the total amount is $3,650 and the number of payments is 5 months. 

First, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate:
Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12
Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12
Monthly interest rate = 0.008333

Now, we can calculate the monthly payment:
Monthly payment = Principal + (Principal * Monthly interest rate)
Monthly payment = $3,650 + ($3,650 * 0.008333)
Monthly payment = $3,650 + $30.25
Monthly payment = $3,680.25

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3,680.25."
"To find the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each of them covered.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe. To do this, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To calculate the profit per hour, we need to first determine the total revenue and total cost. 

The total revenue is the number of cups sold multiplied by the selling price per cup. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and Millie sells 3 pitchers, the total number of cups sold is 3 * 12 = 36 cups. At $1 per cup, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is the initial investment, which is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the information given. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the average of a set of numbers, we need to add up all the values and then divide by the total number of values. In this case, we have five test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 
400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To find the total cost, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. 

We can multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one pencil and the number of pencils by the cost of one eraser, then add the two amounts together.

6 erasers * $3 = $18
8 pencils * $2 = $16

$18 + $16 = $34

The total cost is $34."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of messages to Ms. Thompson. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is (1/3)x.

We know that the total number of messages is 66, so we can set up the equation:

x + (1/3)x = 66

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x + x = 198

Combine like terms:

4x = 198

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 49.5

Since x represents the number of messages to Ms. Thompson, we can round down to 49 (as we can't deliver a fraction of a message). 

Now, we can find the number of messages to Mr. Yu:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 49 = 16.33, which we can round down to 16.

Total number of messages = 49 + 16 = 65

The final answer is 65."
"To determine the amount David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The correct answer is $12."
"When dividing a quantity of ribbon among multiple gifts, we need to consider the total number of gifts and the total amount of ribbon available. In this case, Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and 12 gifts to wrap.

To determine the amount of ribbon each gift can have, we can divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. This is a classic example of division.

The formula for division is:

Total amount of ribbon Ã· Total number of gifts = Ribbon per gift

In this case:

144 inches Ã· 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

We are told that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can set up the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To calculate the percentage of time spent editing, we need to first convert the recording time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we can start by letting x be the number of books in each row. Since the shelving system has 6 rows, the total capacity is 6x.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we can set up the equation:

2(6x) + 20 = total number of books

Since the total number of books is equal to the capacity of the shelving system, we can substitute 6x for the total number of books:

2(6x) + 20 = 6x

Now, we can simplify the equation:

Let's try a different approach. If Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we can set up the equation:

2(6x) + 20 = total number of books

Since the total number of books is equal to the capacity of the shelving system, we can substitute 6x for the total number of books:

2(6x) + 20 = 6x

Now, we can simplify the equation:

12x + 20 = 6x

Subtract 6x from both sides:

6x + 20 = 0

Subtract 20 from both sides:

6x = -20

Divide both sides by 6:

x = -20/6

x = -10/3

Since x represents the number of books in each row, it cannot be negative.

"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to consider the initial number of cards she made, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices she gave away and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She also gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is equivalent to (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. We can rewrite 1/3 as 4/12 and 1/4 as 3/12. 

Now, we can add the fractions: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.

Since Jenny started with 12 slices, we can subtract the total number of slices she gave away (7/12) from 12. To do this, we need to convert 12 to a fraction with the same denominator: 12 = 144/12.

Now, we can subtract: 144/12 - 7/12 = 137/12.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, 137/12 is already simplified.

To find the decimal equivalent, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 137 Ã· 12 = 11.4167.

Since we're dealing with pizza slices, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a slice. So, Jenny has approximately 11 slices left.

The final answer is 11."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save, we can divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

We can set up a division problem: 300 Ã· 10 = ?

This can be solved by dividing 300 by 10, which results in 30.

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

First, we'll find the number of millipedes: 1/3 * 90 = 30.

Next, we'll find the number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we'll add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can represent their ages as variables. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

We are given that Erica is 30 years old, so E = 30.

We are also given that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so B = E + 5.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can express this as A = B + 7.

Substituting the value of B from the second equation into the third equation, we get A = (E + 5) + 7.

Now, substitute the value of E into the equation: A = (30 + 5) + 7.

Simplifying the equation, we get A = 36 + 7 = 43.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is A - E = 43 - 30 = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of glasses (2) by the ounces per glass (8): 2 * 8 = 16
2. Multiply the result (16) by the calories per ounce (3): 16 * 3 = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks in a month and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

There are 4 weeks in a month, and 6 days in a week. So, the total number of working days in a month is 4 * 6 = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

The builder earns $50 per day, so his total earnings for the year would be 288 * 50 = $14400.

Final answer: $14400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can multiply the normal recipe quantities by 4.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 Ã· 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 Ã· 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the energy saved, we need to first find the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). 

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000. So, the daily energy usage in kWh is 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh.

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours:
The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh. Converting this to kWh, we get 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh.

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is 2.7 kWh * 30 = 81 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

The energy saved in 30 days is 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for 20 people, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we can divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches required:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C and the number of corns as K.

We know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, so we can write the equation: K = 2C.

We are also given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, so C = 40.

Substituting C = 40 into the first equation, we get K = 2(40) = 80.

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he now has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 100 + 60 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we need to consider both the time it takes him to finish the book and the travel time to the airport.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to finish the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it takes to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Additionally, Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time required to reach the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby plans to arrive at the airport, we subtract the total time required from the total available time. The available time is 60 minutes, so the time Toby will arrive early is 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to break it down into two parts: May and June.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. To find the total amount paid in May, we multiply the number of employees by the hourly wage and the number of hours worked:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

Next, we need to calculate the number of employees who left in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, we can find the number of employees who left by multiplying the total number of employees by 1/4:

40 employees * 1/4 = 10 employees

Now, we can calculate the number of employees who remained in June:

40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees

The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000 in June.

To find the total amount paid in the two months, we add the amounts paid in May and June:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"To calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds, Sally pays $3. Since she bought 2 pounds, the total cost of the taffy is 2 x $3 = $6.

Next, we need to add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50, and the cost of the 4 magnets, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $6 + $1.50 + $1 = $8.50.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $8.50 = $1.50 left.

$1.50"
"To calculate the total amount spent by Tim, we need to find the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the total cost of the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: 0.20 x $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we can set up a simple division problem. Since she eats 2 cookies per night and wants to have enough for 30 days, we can multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens.

60 cookies Ã· 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events occurring. 

Let's break it down:

- The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% or 0.05.
- The probability of a candle exploding is unknown, but we'll call it x.

Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability of both events occurring:

0.05 * x = 0.05x

We know that the total number of candles is 50,000. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05x. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can multiply the total number of candles by this probability:

50,000 * 0.05x = 2,500x

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as 2,500x.

To find the value of x, we would need more information about the probability of a candle exploding."
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 x $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 x $14
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

So, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

We have two equations:

c + d = 180 ... (Equation 1)
2c + d = 304 ... (Equation 2)

We can multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2d = 360 ... (Equation 3)

Now, we can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3 to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
d = 56

Now that we know 'd', we can substitute it into Equation 1 to find 'c':

c + 56 = 180
c = 124

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a series of equivalent ratios. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can write the ratio:

P = 1/4Z

We also know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

5 = 1/4Z

To solve for Z, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

4 * 5 = Z
20 = Z

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

T = 1/2Z
T = 1/2 * 20
T = 10

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 10 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to consider the initial elevation of Stanley and the vertical distance the comb fell. 

The initial elevation of Stanley is 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. To find the elevation of the comb, we add these two values together.

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Initial elevation of Stanley + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. 

The difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Elevation of Oliver
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To calculate the total capital, we need to add the initial amount Mr. Josue had to the amounts received from the two banks. 

First, we'll find the amount received from the second bank by multiplying the amount received from the first bank by 2. 

$4000 * 2 = $8000

Now, we'll add the initial capital, the amount received from the first bank, and the amount received from the second bank.

$5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $14000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $14000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of cats that were carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried away 5 cats each, we can multiply 4 by 5 to get the total number of cats carried away: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5: 30 * 3/5 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."

1. The first 6 months: $8/month * 6 months = $48
2. The next 8 months: $12/month * 8 months = $96
3. The last 8 months: $14/month * 8 months = $112

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as T and the original price of the jogger jeans as J. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up another equation:

(1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for J from the first equation into the second equation:

(1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6

To simplify, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

T - 6 + 2T = 18

Combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

Now that we know the original price of the tattered jeans is $8, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:

J = T - 6
= 8 - 6
= 2

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"The total capacity of the vehicles can be calculated by adding the capacities of each type of vehicle.

First, we'll multiply the number of buses by their capacity: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

Next, we'll multiply the number of minibusses by their capacity: 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibuss = 180 employees.

Finally, we'll multiply the number of minivans by their capacity: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we'll add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since Lillian bought 3 feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. We know that each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since Lillian built 3 of these feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see by adding the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the cost of the bagel. 25% of $4 is $1, so the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine the total amount of money he made from selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and keeps 1/3 of the cards, he must have made $50 from selling the cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x. He sells x - 1/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5(x - 1/3).

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to first simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.5 = 50

Now, add 0.5 to both sides:

1.5x = 50.5

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 50.5 / 1.5
x = 33.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 33

Therefore, Kenny started with 33 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratios. The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means the ratio of guests to hotdogs is 1:2, with 18 guests having two hotdogs and the remaining 18 guests having one hotdog.

When 40 guests showed up, the caterer had enough hotdogs for all of them to have two hotdogs. This means the ratio of guests to hotdogs is now 40:2, or 20:1.

Since the caterer initially prepared 18 hotdogs for 18 guests, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests:

18 hotdogs / 18 guests = x hotdogs / 40 guests

Solving for x, we get:

x = (18 * 40) / 18
x = 40

This means the caterer had 40 hotdogs in total. Since 18 guests had two hotdogs, the remaining guests had one hotdog each.

The number of guests who had one hotdog is:
40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as 'x'. Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we can express the number of letters in her sister's name as (x/2) + 4.

The total number of letters in both names is the sum of the individual letter counts, which can be represented as:

x + ((x/2) + 4)

To simplify this expression, we can combine like terms:

x + (x/2) + 4 = (2x + x)/2 + 4 = (3x)/2 + 4

Since we know that Indras' name has 6 letters, we can substitute x = 6 into the equation:

(3(6))/2 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name is 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the individual costs:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we calculate the 20% discount:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

We can find the total cost by adding these amounts together: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, for a total of $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

$1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This means Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

First, we'll convert 15 gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply 15 gallons by 8 pints/gallon.

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Now, we'll find 1/4 of 120 pints.

1/4 of 120 pints = 120 * 1/4 = 120/4 = 30 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags of chips as C and the number of candy bars as B.

We know that George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can write the equation:

40C + 75B = 500

We also know that George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. Since he spent $5, he had $0.01 left, which is equivalent to 1 cent. This can be written as:

40C + 75B = 499

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

40C + 75B = 500
40C + 75B = 499

To solve this system, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate C:

(40C + 75B) - (40C + 75B) = 500 - 499
0 = 1

This equation is a contradiction, which means that the system has no solution. However, we can try to find a solution by checking the original equations.

Let's re-examine the first equation: 40C + 75B = 500. We can try to find a combination of C and B that satisfies this equation.

One possible solution is C = 5 and B = 5. Let's verify this solution:

40(5) + 75(5) = 200 + 375 = 575, which is not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

However, we can try another combination: C = 4 and B = 6.

40(4) + 75(6) = 160 + 450 = 610, which is also not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

Let's try another combination: C = 3 and B = 7.

40(3) + 75(7) = 120 + 525 = 645, which is not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

Let's try another combination: C = 2 and B = 8.

40(2) + 75(8) = 80 + 600 = 680, which is not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

Let's try another combination: C = 1 and B = 9.

40(1) + 75(9) = 40 + 675 = 715, which is not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

Let's try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67.

40(0) + 75(6.67) = 0 + 500.25, which is not equal to 500. This solution is not correct.

However, we can try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67 is not a whole number, so we try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67 is not a whole number, so we try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67 is not a whole number, so we try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67 is not a whole number, so we try another combination: C = 0 and B = 6.67 is not a whole number, so we try another

"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends.

Total lollipops = 25
Number of friends = 4

Lollipops per friend = Total lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 25 Ã· 4
Lollipops per friend = 6.25

Since we can't divide lollipops into fractions, we can round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, each friend would receive 6 lollipops.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Since there are 8 pieces in total and 2 people had a piece, we can divide 8 by 2 to find the number of pieces each person had. 

8 Ã· 2 = 4

Now, we multiply the number of pieces each person had by the weight of each piece to find the total weight of the pieces.

4 pieces * 2 ounces/piece = 8 ounces

Finally, we subtract the weight of the pieces from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake.

20 ounces - 8 ounces = 12 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 12 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges. 

Sitti and Juris have a combined total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, including Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. There are 8 people in total.

56 Ã· 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, we calculate the cost of the onions: 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

Now, we add the costs of the onions and the beef stock: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $8.00 Ã· 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio of the time it takes for Wayne and Bernadette to get to the theater. Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as B. We know that B = 4W, since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation:

B = W - 5

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get:

4W = W - 5

Subtracting W from both sides gives us:

3W = -5

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

W = -5/3

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of time, so let's re-examine the equation. We can rewrite the equation as:

B = 4W
B - 5 = W

Subtracting B from both sides gives us:

-5 = W - B
-5 = W - 4W
-5 = -3W
W = 5/3

Now that we have the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater:

B = 4W
B = 4(5/3)
B = 20/3

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we can subtract the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater from the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater:

Time difference = W - B
Time difference = 5/3 - 20/3
Time difference = -15/3
Time difference = -5

Since time can't be negative, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get:

Time difference = 5

However, this is the time difference in minutes, and we want to know how much earlier Bernadette should leave. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we can set up the equation:

B - 5 = W

Substituting B = 20/3 and W = 5/3, we get:

20/3 - 5 = 5/3

To find the time Bernadette should leave, we can subtract 5 from 20/3:

20/3 - 5 = 20/3 - 15/3
= 5/3

Since Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 5/3 hours to get to the theater, we can convert the time to minutes:

5/3 hours = 5/3 x 60 minutes
= 100 minutes

Now, we can find the time Bernadette should leave:

Time Bernadette should leave = Time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater + 5 minutes
= 5/3 + 5
= 20/3

To convert this to a more understandable format, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3:

Time Bernadette should leave = 20/3
= 20/3 x 3/3
= 60/9
= 20/3

To convert this to a more understandable format, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3:

Time Bernadette should leave = 20/3
= 20/3
= 6.67 hours
= 6 hours 40 minutes

Since Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can find the time Bernadette should leave:

Time Bernadette should leave = Time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater - 5 minutes
= 4 minutes - 5 minutes
= -1 minute

Since time can't be negative, we can add 60 minutes to both sides:

Time Bernadette should leave = 60 minutes - 1 minute
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has a total of 1 + 2 * 20 = 41 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has a total of 3 + 4 * 20 = 83 beads.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 83 - 41 = 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Since the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is:

Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, we need to calculate the cooling effect. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total cooling effect is:

Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute
Cooling time = 30 minutes
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:

Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

Let's denote James' swim time as S, bike time as B, and run time as R. We know that James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so S = 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes. We also know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so B = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + R - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + R

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = R

So, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we first convert the length of Movie C to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total distance the horse runs, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to calculate the sum of the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many trays Rozanne can fill with 50 eggs, given that each tray holds 5 glasses and each glass needs 5 eggs. To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 Ã· 5 = 10.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 10 trays of eggnog."
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we need to calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score.

Joey initially had 214 points. He then scored 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy, who initially had 225 points, scored 10 points, increasing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score: 240 - 235 = 5

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Final answer: 5"
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of sneakers sold (17) by the selling price ($20).

Revenue from selling 17 sneakers = 17 * $20 = $340

Next, we find the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. The number of remaining sneakers is 48 - 17 = 31. 

Revenue from selling 31 sneakers = 31 * $25 = $775

Now, we add the revenues from both sales to find the total revenue.

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can break it down into two parts: the six packets with 8 colors each and the four packets with 16 colors each.

For the six packets with 8 colors each, we can multiply 6 (the number of packets) by 8 (the number of colors per packet) to get 6 x 8 = 48.

For the four packets with 16 colors each, we can multiply 4 (the number of packets) by 16 (the number of colors per packet) to get 4 x 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is 112."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as x. Since the cost of the soda is $3, the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $12 + x + 3 = 17.

Now, we can solve for x:

12 + x + 3 = 17

Combine like terms:

15 + x = 17

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 2

The cost of the popcorn is $2.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can use the concept of unit cost. 

First, we need to find the unit cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. We know that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the unit cost of filling one balloon after the price increase is $900 / 20 = $45.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 170 x $45 = $7650.

The final answer is: $7650"
"To calculate the average speed of the car, we need to consider the weighted average of the two speeds and the corresponding time periods. 

Let's assign a weight to each speed based on the time taken. Since the car spends 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph, we can assign a weight of 2 to the 60 mph speed and a weight of 1 to the 30 mph speed.

Weighted average speed = (Weighted sum of speeds) / (Weighted sum of weights)
Weighted average speed = (2 * 60 + 1 * 30) / (2 + 1)
Weighted average speed = (120 + 30) / 3
Weighted average speed = 150 / 3
Weighted average speed = 50

Therefore, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she has left after trading 3 for rubies. 

Jenna initially has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires, so she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we calculate the value of the rubies she received. Jenna received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

Therefore, the total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we can multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples per day, we can multiply 4 (the number of apples per day) by 2 (the number of people) to get the total number of apples eaten per day: 4 * 2 = 8.

Then, we multiply the total number of apples eaten per day (8) by the number of days (30) to get the total number of apples eaten in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

Therefore, the total cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden will be $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find this by multiplying the number of red cards by 1.6 (which is equivalent to 100% + 60%).

Number of green cards = 15 * 1.6 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to break down the sequence of events:

Initially, there were 50 fairies. Then, 25 more fairies joined from the east, making the total 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. After that, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we can add the number of puppies from both dogs: 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20 puppies.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

The total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of each item:
- 2 boxes of sugar cubes = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, we add the weights together:
Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Next, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To calculate Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to consider the value of both aluminum cans and plastic bottles. 

First, let's calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans a week, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, we'll calculate the total earnings from plastic bottles. Each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles a week, so her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we'll add the weekly earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total weekly earnings: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To determine her monthly earnings, we'll multiply the total weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to calculate Toni's plants first. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

First, we calculate the total number of basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall total: 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so we subtract these from the total to find the number of cards remaining: 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student received 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples each of them bought and subtract the discount from each total.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9. Subtracting the $1 discount, she paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10. Subtracting the 10% discount, which is 0.10 x $10 = $1, Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $9.

To find the difference in the amount paid, subtract Kelly's amount from Becky's amount: $8 - $9 = -$1. However, since we're looking for the difference in the amount paid, we consider the absolute value, which is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we determine the number of pencils used in two months. Since 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can calculate this as (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils. This can be found by multiplying 240 by (1/3), giving us (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve the equation (1/2)x + 2 = 5, we can start by isolating the variable x. 

First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet. There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We can set up the equation (1/4)x = 20 to represent the situation. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B. We're given that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3.

We can use the formula for the size of the union of two sets: |D âˆª P| = |D| + |P| - |B|.

Substituting the given values, we get |D âˆª P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that the total number of kids in the class is 32. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the size of the union of D and P from the total number of kids: 32 - |D âˆª P| = 32 - 12 = 20.

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we must first calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of oats in each bag, which is 50 pounds. This gives us 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we can use the concept of fractions. We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls.

Let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find the number of Pomeranians. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can multiply 27 (the total number of puppies) by 2/3.

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we can multiply the whole number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3).

27 * 2 = 54
54 Ã· 3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can multiply 18 (the number of Pomeranians) by 1/3.

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we can multiply the whole number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (3).

18 * 1 = 18
18 Ã· 3 = 6

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, we divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is -10."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The remaining amount is the difference between the total cost of the toy and the amount he already has: $12 - $4 = $8.

Now, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount to find the number of days: $8 Ã· $2 = 4.

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy."
"To determine the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to consider the capacity of the trays and the total number of eggs.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. To find the total capacity, we multiply the number of trays by the capacity per tray:

2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

Final answer: 16"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3 to find the cost of the family-size pizza.

The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times the cost of the small pizza, which is $8. 

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total cost.

Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To calculate the cost of each individual razor, we need to consider the buy one get one free promotion and the $2.00 coupon.

First, we'll calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00.

Next, we'll subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost of 1 pack: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. 

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, and their average height is 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and their average height is also 64 inches. Therefore, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and their average height is also 64 inches. Thus, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60 inches tall and is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days, we need to multiply the number of minutes she walks per hour by the number of hours she works per day, and then multiply that result by the number of days.

First, we multiply 5 minutes (her walking time per hour) by 8 hours (her work hours per day): 5 * 8 = 40 minutes per day.

Next, we multiply 40 minutes (her daily walking time) by 5 days (the number of days she works): 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can write the equation:

A + 4 = 3(14)

This equation represents the relationship between Angela's current age and Brett's age in four years. To solve for A, we can start by distributing the 3 on the right side of the equation:

A + 4 = 42

Next, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate A:

A = 42 - 4

A = 38

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is 38."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to multiply the number of rides per day by the cost per ride and then multiply the result by the number of days.

The cost of morning rides is 2 rides per day * $6 per ride = $12 per day. 
The cost of afternoon rides is 2 rides per day * $2 per ride = $4 per day.

The total daily cost is $12 (morning rides) + $4 (afternoon rides) = $16 per day.

Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, the total cost is $16 per day * 14 days = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges each individual brought and then add them together. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest).
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of insects each person found using variables. Let's say Bodhi found x insects, David found y insects, and Lily found z insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation:

z = y + 7

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation:

y = x/2

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the third equation:

x + y + z = 43

Now we have a system of three equations with three variables. We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

z = (x/2) + 7

Substituting this expression for z into the third equation, we get:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

y = x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

z = y + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

First, we'll convert the fractions to equivalent decimals to make the addition easier. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.25. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 0.5.

Now, we can add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 
0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can multiply the total yards used by 364 to find the total yards:
0.75 * 364 = 273

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"The art of addition is a fundamental aspect of mathematics, and I'm delighted to tackle this problem with precision.

To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we must consider the gifts for each group of friends. There are two distinct scenarios to account for: the 2 friends who desire 5 gifts each and the 3 friends who wish for 2 gifts each.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be represented as 2 x 5, which equals 10.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be represented as 3 x 2, which equals 6.

Now, we'll add these two totals together to determine the overall number of gifts Cherrie purchased. This can be calculated as 10 + 6, resulting in a grand total of 16 gifts.

However, Cherrie didn't stop there. She decided to surprise her friends with 10 additional gifts. To find the new total, we'll add these 10 gifts to the previous total of 16. This can be calculated as 16 + 10, yielding a final total of 26 gifts.

The final answer is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the width of the rug as 'w' and the length of the couch as 'l'. We know that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we can write an equation for the width of the rug:

w = 3 + 5
w = 8

We also know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can write an equation for the length of the couch:

l = 2w + 2

Now, substitute the value of w into the equation for the length of the couch:

l = 2(8) + 2
l = 16 + 2
l = 18

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as x and the cost of a pack of grape gum as y. We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

2x + y = 4 (total cost of strawberry gum)
y = 2 (cost of grape gum)
y = x/2 (cost of green apple gum)

We can substitute the value of y from the second equation into the first equation to get:
2x + 2 = 4
2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting x into the second equation:
y = 2

However, we are asked to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Since we know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is x = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the optimal combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 lumber within the given budget of $24.

Let's define the variables:
x = number of 2 x 4 lumber
y = number of 2 x 8 lumber

The objective function is to maximize the total number of sticks:
Maximize: 200x + 400y

The constraints are:
4x + 6y â‰¤ 24 (budget constraint)
x â‰¥ 0
y â‰¥ 0

To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method or simplex method. However, for simplicity, we can use the graphical method.

First, let's plot the budget constraint on a graph:
4x + 6y = 24

We can find the feasible region by drawing the lines x=0, y=0, and x=6 (since 6y = 24 - 4x). The feasible region is the area bounded by these lines.

Now, let's find the corner points of the feasible region:
Corner point 1: (0, 0)
Corner point 2: (6, 0)
Corner point 3: (0, 4)
Corner point 4: (3, 3)

Evaluating the objective function at each corner point:
Corner point 1: 200(0) + 400(0) = 0
Corner point 2: 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200
Corner point 3: 200(0) + 400(4) = 1600
Corner point 4: 200(3) + 400(3) = 1600

The optimal solution is at corner point 3, where Frederick should buy 0 2 x 4 lumber and 4 2 x 8 lumber, resulting in a total of 1600 popsicle sticks.

"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can use the concept of multiplication. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog to find the total number of snowshoes needed. Then, we can multiply this result by the cost per pair of snowshoes.

Number of dogs: 6
Number of legs per dog: 4
Total number of snowshoes needed: 6 * 4 = 24
Cost per pair of snowshoes: $12.00
Total cost = 24 * $12.00
Total cost = $288.00

"To calculate the weekly savings, we need to find the total cost of Janet's bus trips and subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, and she takes 10 trips per week. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per trip by the number of trips: 2.20 * 10 = 22.

Now, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost: 22 - 20 = 2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to first establish the number of cows and sheep in each location.

Let's denote the number of cows in the farm as F and the number of sheep in the farm as S. We know that the farm has 30 cows, so F = 30.

We are also given that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the number of cows in the zoo is 2F = 2 * 30 = 60.

Additionally, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the number of sheep in the farm is S = F/2 = 30/2 = 15.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo by adding the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Total animals = F + S + (number of cows in the zoo) + (number of sheep in the zoo)
= 30 + 15 + 60 + 20
= 125

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 125."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's say Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Onions: x = (1/4)(12)
Potatoes: y = (1/4)(4)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

Onions: x = 3
Potatoes: y = 1

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add x and y:

Total = x + y = 3 + 1 = 4"
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. Therefore, the number of days from December 31st to July 19th is 183 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds and burns 3500 calories per pound, the total calorie deficit required is 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 183 days â‰ˆ 576 calories/day.

Here's a breakdown of the daily calorie deficit in a more detailed format:

**Daily Calorie Deficit:**
To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories per day.

"To determine how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his total earnings can be calculated by multiplying 30 by 7:

30 * 7 = 210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

210 - 100 = 110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: $110"
"To calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs, we must first convert the distance of each lap from kilometers to milliliters. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 milliliters, we can multiply the number of laps by the conversion factor.

Number of laps = 8
Distance per lap (in kilometers) = 0.25
Distance per lap (in milliliters) = 0.25 * 1000 = 250 ml

Now, we can multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap in milliliters to find the total amount of water needed.

Total water needed = Number of laps * Distance per lap (in milliliters)
Total water needed = 8 * 250
Total water needed = 2000 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To calculate the amount of money Julie had left, we need to find 20% of the initial $500 and then subtract that from the total. 

First, we find 20% of $500: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, we find 25% of the remaining $400:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract $100 from the remaining $400:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"To solve for the cost of the house, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
Let's denote the cost of the house as H and the cost of the lot as L. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

H = 3L

We also know that the total cost is $120,000, so we can write:

H + L = 120,000

Substituting H = 3L into the second equation, we get:

3L + L = 120,000
4L = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:

L = 120,000 / 4
L = 30,000

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting L into the equation H = 3L:

H = 3(30,000)
H = 90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 8 packs * $4 per pack = $32.

"To calculate the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to multiply the number of punches he throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight.

The number of punches per minute is 25, and the total number of minutes in the fight is 3 rounds * 5 minutes per round = 15 minutes.

To find the total number of punches, we multiply 25 by 15.

25 * 15 = 375

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"To calculate the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

To find the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner, we need to calculate 3/5 of the remaining amount of money. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods. Let's denote the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as 'r'. Since Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob, we can set up the equation:

2r + 40 = t

where 't' represents the time it takes Royce to shingle a house.

We are given that Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We can substitute this value into the equation:

2r + 40 = 120

Now, we can solve for 'r':

2r = 120 - 40
2r = 80
r = 80/2
r = 40

Now that we know the time it takes Rob to shingle a house, we can find the time it takes Royce:

t = 2r + 40
t = 2(40) + 40
t = 80 + 40
t = 120 + 40
t = 160

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 160 minutes.

"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know Chris completes 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. The total problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Next, we need to find the remaining problems. Since Chris has 100 problems in total, we subtract the problems completed so far: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

Now, we know Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems on Wednesday. To find one-quarter of 52, we multiply 52 by 1/4, which is 52 * 0.25 = 13 problems.

Finally, we subtract the problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems: 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

The final answer is 39."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of quarts Bobby can pick per hour. Since Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, who picks 6 quarts, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Next, we know Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. So, Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, who picks 10 quarts. Therefore, Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we must first calculate the total number of loaves sold. This can be done by adding the number of loaves sold in the morning to the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.

Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Next, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked to find the number of loaves left.

Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves left = 200 - 132 = 68

However, we also need to account for the 6 loaves that were returned. To do this, we add the returned loaves to the number of loaves left.

Loaves left = 68 + 6 = 74

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 Ã· 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 Ã· 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3. The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

Therefore, Jackson can plant 6 rows of flowers in total.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

We can convert the mixed number 3/4 to an improper fraction: 3/4 = 3/4.

Now, we can divide the total number of raisins (27) by the improper fraction 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.

Number of batches = Total raisins * (4/3)
= 27 * (4/3)
= 108/3
= 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to determine her original and new weekly consumption.

First, we calculate her original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. Then, we multiply this by the cost per kilowatt-hour, which is $1.50, to find the original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

Next, we calculate her new weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. We then multiply this by the number of days in a week, 7, to find the new weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours. Finally, we multiply the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour, $1.50, to find the new weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time taken to complete a task. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as x days. We can set up the proportion:

1 person : 5 days = 1 person : x days

Since the rate of work remains constant, we can equate the two ratios:

5 days = x days

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to consider the inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time taken. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

If 1 person can paint half a house in 5 days, then the rate of work is 1/2 house per 5 days. To find the rate of work for 1 person, we can divide the rate by 2:

Rate of work for 1 person = (1/2 house) / 2 = 1/4 house per day

Now, we can use the concept of inverse proportionality to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time taken by 5 people = (1/4 house per day) / 5 people = 1/20 house per person per day

Since 5 people can paint 5 times the rate of 1 person, they can paint 5 times the amount in the same time. Therefore, the time taken by 5 people to paint a whole house is:

Time taken by 5 people = 1/ (1/20) = 20 days

However, we need to convert this to hours:

Time taken by 5 people = 20 days * 24 hours/day = 480 hours

The correct answer is 480 hours."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x' and the number of chairs Jenna has as '3x'. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2.

We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
Jenna's chairs = 3x = 3 * 22 = 66

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the headphone set.

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as x. We know that the total amount paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. We can set up the equation:

$4 + x = $48

Subtracting $4 from both sides gives us:

x = $44

Now, we can divide the total amount paid by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought:

$48 Ã· $4 = 12

Since Tom could have bought 12 CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, the correct answer is:

$12"
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the varying hours he worked each week. 

Let's break it down:

- For 6 weeks, Josh worked 4 hours per week. So, the total hours for these weeks is 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.
- For 1 week, Josh worked 5 hours.
- For 1 week, Josh worked 6 hours.

Now, we add up the hours: 24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Finally, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers now is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is 122."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let Jame's current age be x and his cousin's current age be y.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old, and in 8 years, his cousin will be y + 8 years old. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This gives us the equation:

y + 8 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y + 8 = 2x + 5

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

y = 2x - 3

Now, we can express y in terms of x. We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22. We can substitute x = 22 into the equation y = 2x - 3:

y = 2(22) - 3
y = 44 - 3
y = 41

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can find the age difference between Jame and his cousin. The age difference is 41 - 22 = 19 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the monitors as M, and the cost of the printer as P.

We know that the total cost is $2,400, so we can write the equation:

C + M + P = 2400

We also know that the computer costs $1,100, so C = 1100.

Additionally, we know that the printer costs $400 less than the computer, so P = C - 400.

Substituting the value of C into the second equation, we get:

P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now we can substitute the values of C and P into the first equation:

1100 + M + 700 = 2400

Combine like terms:

1800 + M = 2400

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

M = 600

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that the boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 10 boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

Next, we are told that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 4 * 60 = 240 more seashells than the boys. 

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to the additional seashells brought by the girls: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's represent the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Nick's initial amount:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially."
"To determine Anne's age, we need to calculate Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can find Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from 10.

10 - 4 = 6

Next, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

6 + 2 = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

Let's break it down:

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Now, we'll subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs needed: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is 18."
"To calculate the total amount you paid, we need to find 20% of the $50 dinner bill and add it to the original bill.

20% of $50 can be calculated by multiplying $50 by 0.20, which equals $10.

Adding the tip to the original bill, we get $50 + $10 = $60.

Therefore, the total amount you paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily savings amount for the second half of the month. Let's denote the daily savings amount in the first half of the month as x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, the daily savings amount in the second half will be 2x.

We know that the total savings for the first half of the month is $1125, and there are 15 days in the first half of April. So, we can set up the equation:

x * 15 = 1125

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 1125 / 15
x = 75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, the daily savings amount in the second half will be 2x:

2x = 2 * 75
2x = 150

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total cost of the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can multiply the amount each earns per task by the total number of tasks completed.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * 0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference in their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount of money is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad gets $20, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying 4 and 20:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

Therefore, Jeff gets $80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work. 

Distance from home to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into three parts: writing the alphabet in full twice, writing half of it once, and re-writing everything she has already written.

First, let's calculate the number of letters in each part:

- Writing the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
- Writing half of it once: 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters
- Re-writing everything she has already written: 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

Now, let's add up the total number of letters: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"The problem can be modeled as a geometric sequence, where the first term (a) is 3 and the common ratio (r) is 3. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:

an = a * r^(n-1)

In this case, we want to find the number of families notified in the fourth round, so we need to find the 4th term of the sequence.

a = 3
r = 3
n = 4

an = 3 * 3^(4-1)
an = 3 * 3^3
an = 3 * 27
an = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we can use the concept of subtraction and multiplication. 

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as x. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. 

We know that his final weight is 70 pounds. To find the initial weight, we can set up the equation: x - 30 = 70.

Solving for x, we get x = 70 + 30 = 100.

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. Since he needs 2 more toys to have a play set five times larger than James's play set, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 5(80)

This equation represents the situation: Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have a set five times larger than James's 80-toy set.

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying 5 and 80:

x + 2 = 400

Next, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x = 400 - 2

x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective prices and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Now, we add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The final answer is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission rate is 30%. This means Antonella earns 30% of the first $1000, which is $300.

For sales over $1000, the commission rate increases to 40% (30% + 10%). This means Antonella earns 40% of the amount above $1000, which is 40% of $1500 ($2500 - $1000).

To calculate the additional commission, we multiply $1500 by 0.4, which equals $600.

Now, we add the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000: $300 + $600 = $900.

Therefore, Antonella earned $900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can break down the problem into two parts: the total number of bottles he needs and the number of bottles he already has.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles he needs. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles for each guest, we can multiply the number of guests by 2: 70 x 2 = 140.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles he already has. We know that he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so we can multiply the number of cases by 24: 2 x 24 = 48.

Now, to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know that he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find twice the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day:
2 x 16 = 32 minutes

Then, we add 2 minutes to this result:
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

Next, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day:
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings: $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3 * $40 = $120

The total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160."
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 Ã· 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 Ã— 1/4 = 12 Ã— 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

"To find the total number of rodents, we can use the distributive property of multiplication. We have 3 groups of cages, and each group has a different number of rodents.

Let's break it down:

3 cages with 10 hamsters each: 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters
3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each: 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To calculate the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the sun relative to the ground (32 degrees) and the angular velocity of the sun (5 degrees per hour).

The angular velocity of the sun is 5 degrees per hour. To find the total angle the sun has moved upward in 10 hours, we multiply the angular velocity by the time:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the sun (32 degrees) to the total angle it has moved upward (50 degrees) to find the final angle from the ground to the sun:

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, the sun will be at an angle of 82 degrees from the ground after 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to calculate the number of packs James needs to buy. 

Since James has two sons, he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old. 

The total number of candles needed is 2 + 2 = 4 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles by 5 to find the number of packs needed.

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate her reading speed in pages per minute. We are given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. 

First, we find her reading speed in pages per minute by dividing the number of pages by the number of minutes: 
2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute

Now, we can calculate the total number of minutes she read in two weeks. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week, and 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the second week. 
Total minutes = 105 + 105 = 210 minutes

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we multiply her reading speed by the total minutes: 
1.33 pages/minute * 210 minutes = 278 pages

"To find the number of sandwiches left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 4 sandwiches (since 1/3 of 12 is 4). 

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 3 sandwiches (since 1/4 of 12 is 3).

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial total.
12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Shiloh's current age be S and his nephew's current age be N. We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we have a fixed amount of $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, we have a sequence of three teeth worth $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the amount per tooth is half of the previous sequence, which is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write the equation:
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
R = A + 45

Since we are given that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the second equation to find A:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"The art of subtraction and multiplication - my bread and butter. Let's dive into this problem.

We're given that Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. To find the total amount he made, we simply multiply the number of lemonades by the price of each. This is a classic case of the multiplication principle.

21 * 4 = 84

Now, we're told that Liam made $63. To find the difference between Mitchell's earnings and Liam's, we need to subtract Liam's amount from Mitchell's. This is a straightforward application of the subtraction principle.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to break down his spending into two parts: the wooden action figures and the plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures. Since Peter spent $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, we can multiply the daily expenditure by the number of days:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after spending on wooden action figures. We'll subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$70 - $15 = $55

Next, we'll calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost of a single figure:

$55 Ã· $2 = 27.5

Since we can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total:

3 (wooden) + 27 (plastic) = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the vaccines is $20 each, and there are 3 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

First, we calculate the total number of roses each shop orders in a month by multiplying the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Next, we add the total number of roses each shop orders in a month to find the total number of roses supplied:

80 (first shop) + 60 (second shop) + 120 (third shop) = 260 roses

Since Ford grows 40 roses per week, we multiply this number by 4 to find the total number of roses he grows in a month:

40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to multiply the monthly withdrawal amount by the number of months in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years have 24 months.

The total amount removed from the account is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to analyze the revenue and cost structure.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, generating a total revenue of $70.00. The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00, and the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. 

To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and subtract it from the total revenue. 

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The net profit margin can be calculated by dividing the net profit by the total revenue and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Net profit margin = (Net profit / Total revenue) * 100
Net profit margin = ($37.00 / $70.00) * 100
Net profit margin = 52.86%

The food truck's net profit is $37.00, and its net profit margin is 52.86%."
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box and then divide by the number of crayons per muffin.

First, we multiply 3 boxes by 64 crayons per box:

3 * 64 = 192

Next, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 crayons per muffin:

192 Ã· 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin:

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the padding, and the installation.

First, we calculate the area of the room: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet in Michael's bedroom is $9608."
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days and then divide by 7.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To evaluate the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Calculate half of the starting value: 20/2 = 10
2. Add 10 to the starting value: 20 + 10 = 30
3. Divide the result by 5: 30/5 = 6
4. Subtract 12 from the starting value: 20 - 12 = 8
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4: 6 * 8 = 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 18 degrees off from the set temperature. To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of the desired temperature. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cups Judy brought as C and the number of dishes she brought as D.

We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, so C = 12. We also know that she bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C.

We are also given that Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of cups her friend brought is C + 40, and the number of dishes her friend brought is D + 20.

Since the total number of cups is the sum of Judy's cups and her friend's cups, we can set up the equation: C + (C + 40) = 52.

Substituting C = 12 into the equation, we get 12 + (12 + 40) = 52, which is true.

Now, we can find the number of dishes Judy's friend brought by setting up the equation D + 20 = 44, since her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Solving for D, we get D = 24.

Now that we know the number of dishes Judy brought (D = 24) and the number of dishes her friend brought (D = 44), we can find the total number of dishes: 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils is the sum of the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the discounted price of 2 boxes. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 

First, calculate 10% of $100.00: 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. 

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Next, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 pairs.

Finally, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 Ã· 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To calculate the earnings of Jill and John, we need to break down their work hours and rates.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her hourly rate is $10, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His hourly rate is also $10, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

First, we calculate the calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. 

Next, we calculate the calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories. 

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Finally, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find the total amount of water she needs: 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of blue jelly beans be B, the number of red jelly beans be R, and the number of green jelly beans be G. We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the numbers together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' spouses, and the number of people she directly invited.

First, we'll calculate the total number of people invited by Alex. She initially invited 100 people. Then, each of these 100 people invited 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200 additional people. Additionally, Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, adding 18 more people to the total.

Now, we'll add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

The final answer is: $\boxed{318}$"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

First, we know the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Since the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, we know the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find the Papillon's weight, we divide the Dachshund's weight by 4: 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, we know the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. To find the Mastiff's weight, we multiply the Papillon's weight by 44: 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, resulting in a total cost of $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The height of the beanstalk can be modeled by the equation:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t (in days), and 4 is the initial height.

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that h(t) > 20 (the height of Mark's window).

We can set up the inequality:

4 * 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) â‰ˆ 2.32

Since t must be an integer, the smallest value of t that satisfies the inequality is t = 3.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of protein John gets per week, we can use the concept of ratios. We know that 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can set up a ratio to find the amount of protein he consumes per day:

200 grams (mushrooms) / 100 grams (per cup) = 2 cups per day

Now, we can multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup to find the daily protein intake:

2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams per day

To find the weekly protein intake, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable representing Jerry's current age.

Let's denote Jerry's current age as x. The statement ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago"" can be translated into the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

Now that we have found Jerry's current age, we can determine his age in 3 years by adding 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 Ã· $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we are asked to find the largest angle, the answer is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 Ã· $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to calculate 50% of the original weight and then subtract 2 pounds from the result.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Adding this to the original weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds

Subtracting 2 pounds from the result: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into three parts: the number of games he receives as gifts, the number of games he buys each year, and the total number of games he buys over the three years.

The number of games Steve receives as gifts is 5 per year, and he receives 5 games for Christmas each year. So, the total number of games he receives as gifts is 5 (birthday) + 5 (Christmas) = 10 games per year.

The number of games Steve buys each year is as follows:
- Year 1: 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Year 2: 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Year 3: 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games

To find the total number of games Steve buys over the three years, we can add the number of games he buys each year: 12 (Year 1) + 12 (Year 2) + 24 (Year 3) = 48 games.

Now, we can add the total number of games Steve receives as gifts (10 games per year) to the total number of games he buys over the three years (48 games) to find the total number of games he has after 3 years: 10 (gifts) + 48 (buys) = 58 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To find the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can use the concept of proportionality. Since the plane maintains a constant rate, we can set up a proportion to relate the initial distance, time, and rate.

Let's denote the additional time required as 'x'. We know that the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time taken, and the rate remains constant. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

1200 miles / 3 hours = 2000 miles / (3 + x) hours

Cross-multiplying, we get:

1200(3 + x) = 2000 * 3

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

3600 + 1200x = 6000

Subtracting 3600 from both sides, we get:

1200x = 2400

Dividing both sides by 1200, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, it would take the plane 2 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to calculate their individual rates and then combine them.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his rate, we divide the amount by the time: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, Marissa makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To find the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, he spent $8. 
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

The final answer is $12."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the hourly earnings, we multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the price per cup: 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour. Then, we multiply the hourly earnings by the number of hours worked: $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. To find the hourly earnings, we multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the price per cup: 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour. Then, we multiply the hourly earnings by the number of hours worked: $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years a tire will last, we need to consider the total number of rotations it can undergo and the number of rotations per year.

First, we calculate the total number of rotations per year by dividing the total miles driven per year by the miles per rotation.

Total miles driven per year = 400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year
Total rotations per year = 4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years it will last.

Total rotations = 10,440,000 rotations
Total rotations per year = 2400 rotations/year

Years until replacement = Total rotations / Total rotations per year
= 10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year
= 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 4362.5"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to find the discount on the shirt. The shirt's original price is $25, and the discount is 30% of that amount.

Discount = $25 * 0.3 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we'll add 8% of the total cost to find the final amount Joe will pay. Sales tax = $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial $50:

$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, we can round the result to the nearest cent. Rounding $6.70 to the nearest cent gives us $6.70.

The final amount Joe will have left is $6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter required per dozen. Since 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter, we can multiply 4 dozen croissants by 1/4 pound.

First, we need to convert 4 dozen to a whole number by multiplying by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12). This gives us 4 * 12 = 48 croissants.

Now, we multiply 48 croissants by 1/4 pound:

48 * 1/4 = 48 * 0.25 = 12

Therefore, Juan will need 12 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Lewis' and Monica's streets, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost per meter is $194, and Monica's street is 150 meters long. To find the cost of repaving her street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of her street:

$194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long:

$194 * 490 = $95,060

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, repaving Lewis' street costs $65,960 more than repaving Monica's street."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n periods, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $100,000, and the monthly interest rate (r) is 50% or 0.5. The number of periods (n) is 10, as the research took 10 times the initial 5 months.

However, since the funding increased by 50% each month, we can model this as an exponential growth problem. We can use the formula for compound interest with a growing rate, which is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where r is the monthly growth rate.

The monthly growth rate can be calculated as 1 + (0.5/100) = 1.005, since the funding increased by 50% each month.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the research using the formula:

A = 100,000 * (1.005)^10
A â‰ˆ 100,000 * 1.6289
A â‰ˆ 162,890

However, this is the cost for the first 5 months. To find the cost for the remaining 5 months, we can use the formula for compound interest with a growing rate, but with the initial amount being the cost of the first 5 months, which is $500,000.

A = 500,000 * (1.005)^5
A â‰ˆ 500,000 * 1.2763
A â‰ˆ 638,150

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$162,890 + $638,150 = $801,040

The total cost of John's research is $801,040."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to convert the weight of the third player's steak from pounds to ounces. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player's steak is 16 ounces.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
The first player ate 6 ounces of steak.
The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips.
The third player ate 16 ounces of steak.
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Total ounces of meat consumed = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March.

The number of posts per day is 3, and the number of days in March is 31. 

When multiplying 3 by 31, we can break it down as follows:

3 * 30 = 90
3 * 1 = 3

Adding these two results together, we get:
90 + 3 = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we need to multiply the number of times Gary does laundry in a year by the amount of water used per load and then multiply that result by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry 52 weeks * 2 times per week = 104 times per year. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons of water used per year by the cost per gallon: 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to consider the costs of each item. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each is equivalent to 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, we have the coral, which costs $2.00 per piece, and Scarlett bought 3 pieces, so the total cost for the coral is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

The aquarium costs $10.00, the fish cost $0.50 each, and Scarlett bought 20 fish, so the total cost for the fish is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

Lastly, the fish food costs $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

The total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can break it down into individual weeks.

Week 1: The initial height is 3 inches.

Week 2: The height doubles, so it becomes 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Week 3: The height increases by 4 inches, so it becomes 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first convert the weight of the bull from kilograms to the amount of meat it represents.

Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, we can convert the weight of the bull to hours by dividing the weight by the amount of meat sold per hour.

750kg / 15kg per hour = 50 hours

Now, we know that Prince works 10 hours a day. To find the number of days it will take him to sell the meat, we can divide the total hours by the number of hours he works per day.

50 hours / 10 hours per day = 5 days

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of seats in the school auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights. Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 intersections, we can find the total number of street lights by multiplying the number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections.

Total number of street lights = Number of street lights per intersection * Number of intersections
Total number of street lights = 4 * 6
Total number of street lights = 24

Next, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights.

Number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
Number of functioning street lights = 24 - 20
Number of functioning street lights = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played and subtract the number of times each DVD has been used.

Let's start by adding the number of times each DVD has been played: 356 + 135 = 491.

Next, we subtract the number of times each DVD has been used from the total capacity of each DVD: 
1000 - 356 = 644
1000 - 135 = 865

Now, we add the results of these subtractions: 644 + 865 = 1509.

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to multiply the number of sessions by the number of hours per session and then multiply the result by the cost per hour.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of sessions by the number of hours per session:
12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour:

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can find the total number of pieces he chews at school by dividing the total hours by 2. 

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

Next, we add the additional pieces of gum he chews on the way home from school and after dinner. 

4 (pieces chewed at school) + 1 (piece chewed on the way home) + 1 (piece chewed after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial amount of gum. 

20 (initial pieces) - 6 (pieces chewed) = 14 pieces of gum

Finally, we need to find half of the remaining gum, which Jim gives to his sister. 

14 (remaining pieces) / 2 = 7 pieces

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to find her current age first. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now that we know Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we can find her age 4 years from now by adding 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the difference in spending between the two coaches, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost per baseball:
9 * 3 = 27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball:
8 * 14 = 112

Now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts:
112 - 27 = 85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that represents the proportion of bloomed flowers. 

We can rewrite the fraction 4/5 as a decimal: 4 Ã· 5 = 0.8. 

Now, we multiply the total number of flowers (200) by this decimal: 
200 * 0.8 = 160

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To convert kilobits per second to megabits per hour, we need to perform two conversions: kilobits to megabits and seconds to hours.

First, convert kilobits to megabits:
1 megabit = 1000 kilobits
Ashley's speed = 20 kilobits per second
To convert to megabits per second, divide by 1000:
20 kilobits/second Ã· 1000 = 0.02 megabits/second

Next, convert seconds to hours:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 minutes Ã— 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds
Multiply Ashley's speed by 3600 to get the speed in megabits per hour:
0.02 megabits/second Ã— 3600 seconds/hour = 72 megabits/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 megabits per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 6 cars per day (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 + 24 = 54 cars.

The final answer is 54."
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. We know that Adam's height increases by 2 inches each year, and he needs to reach a total of 48 inches to ride the roller coaster.

We can set up the following proportion:

40 + 2x = 48

To solve for 'x', we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 8

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars. So, the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the total cost minus the amount paid by the company, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the price of the diamond as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, so we can write the equation:

G = (4/5)D

We are also given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can write another equation:

S = G - 400

Since we know the price of the diamond is $2000, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the price of the gold jewel:

G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

Now that we have the price of the gold jewel, we can find the price of the silver jewel:

S = G - 400
S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Finally, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding their prices:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to break down the information and solve the problem step by step.

First, we know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. We also know he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. This means he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Next, we are told he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps: 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours.

Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles, and this distance will be covered by Tom in 't' hours. We can set up the equation:

15t = 75

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides by 15:

t = 75 / 15
t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. 

First, we'll find out how many fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class is $10. To find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

$60 Ã· $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for.

10 (classes already signed up for) - 6 (maximum classes they are willing to pay for) = 4 classes

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Lynn ran x miles. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie ran 5(4) = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = x + 3

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 3
x = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's use variables to represent the cost of one apple and one orange.

Let A be the cost of one apple and O be the cost of one orange.

We know that 4A = $5.20 and 3O = $3.30.

To find the cost of one apple, we can divide both sides of the first equation by 4: A = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

To find the cost of one orange, we can divide both sides of the second equation by 3: O = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

Total cost = 5A + 5O
= 5($1.30) + 5($1.10)
= $6.50 + $5.50
= $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to first determine the volume of the hole. The formula for volume is length * width * depth.

Given that the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the volume by the rate:

Time = Volume * Rate
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to break down the costs of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and the bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current salary of $20,000. To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05.

$20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current salary to find his new monthly salary.

$20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12.

$31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs of each item and then add them together.

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information into steps:

1. Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so we can represent Steve's wife's age as 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
2. Their son is half as old as his mother, so we can represent the son's age as 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
3. The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so we can represent the son's wife's age as 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. 

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can multiply 8 (the number of portions) by 2 (the weight of each portion) to get the total weight of flour in one bag, which is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Then, we multiply the weight of flour in one bag by the number of bags, which is 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at a rate of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find her total distance, we multiply the rate by the time: 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Stanley biked at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find his total distance, we multiply the rate by the time: 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Now, let's add their distances together: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Let's break it down:

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes needed, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we have Howie, who requires 2 cupcakes. Then, there's his teacher, who also needs 2 cupcakes. Lastly, there are 25 classmates, each requiring 2 cupcakes as well.

To find the total number of cupcakes, we can add the number of cupcakes for each group: 2 (Howie) + 2 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 2 + 2 + 25 = 29.

However, since the question asks for the total number of cupcakes, we must multiply the number of classmates by 2, as each classmate also gets 2 cupcakes. So, 25 classmates x 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we add the cupcakes for Howie and his teacher to the total: 2 (Howie) + 2 (teacher) + 50 (classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the total number of likes, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. We can set up the equation:

Initial likes + 2000 = 70x

We also know that the initial likes + 20000 is the total number of likes. So, we can set up another equation:

x + 20000 = 70x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the second equation:

20000 = 69x

Next, we can divide both sides by 69 to find the value of x:

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.52

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll keep the exact value for accuracy.

Now that we have the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes by adding 20000:

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 288.52 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.52

The final answer is 20129."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 off = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

However, since we are looking for the difference in the final prices paid, we can consider the absolute value of the difference, which is $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats in the first month were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red sales = 1/2 * G
Red sales = $400

To find the total sales in the first month, we can add the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Red sales + G
$400 + G = $1200
G = $800

Now that we know the sales from green hats in the first month, we can calculate the total sales in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we can multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Sales in the second month = $900

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage, we need to break down the hours into paid and unpaid periods.

The carriage was hired from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since James gets 1 hour free, the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first hour and the cost of the remaining hours: $15 + $30 = $45.

Therefore, James paid a total of $45 for the horse-drawn carriage.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the current bank account balance from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

Subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage: $300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of deviled egg halves to the number of eggs. Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we can write the proportion as follows:

1 whole egg / 2 deviled egg halves = x whole eggs / 48 deviled egg halves

We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying:

1 * 48 = 2x
48 = 2x
x = 48 / 2
x = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens needed:

24 / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total pages.

Total pages = 15
Fraction of pages left = 2/3

Pages left to write = Total pages * Fraction of pages left
= 15 * 2/3
= 15 * 2 Ã· 3
= 30 Ã· 3
= 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 Ã· 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

To find the total monthly cost, we add the monthly rent and the monthly fuel cost: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since we're calculating the cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12: $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial cost and the first year's costs: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the cooking time for rice is represented by 'r', the cooking time for pork is represented by 'p', and the cooking time for beans is represented by 'b'.

We are given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so r = 30. We are also given that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so p = r + 20. Substituting the value of r, we get p = 30 + 20 = 50.

Additionally, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so b = (p + r) / 2. Substituting the values of p and r, we get b = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: total time = r + p + b = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can use the weighted average formula:

Weighted Average = (Cost of almonds * Weight of almonds + Cost of walnuts * Weight of walnuts) / Total weight

In this case, the weighted average is:

Weighted Average = ($10 * 1/2 + $15 * 1/3) / (1/2 + 1/3)
Weighted Average = ($5 + $5) / (3/6 + 2/6)
Weighted Average = $10 / (5/6)
Weighted Average = $10 * (6/5)
Weighted Average = $12

To find the cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can use the same formula:

Weighted Average = ($10 * 1/5 + $15 * 1/3) / (1/5 + 1/3)
Weighted Average = ($2 + $5) / (3/15 + 5/15)
Weighted Average = $7 / (8/15)
Weighted Average = $7 * (15/8)
Weighted Average = $10.625

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Weighted Average of the first mixture - Weighted Average of the second mixture
= $12 - $10.625
= $1.375

The final answer is: $1.375"
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

We have two equations:

1) 4s + 2g = 70
2) s + g = 20

We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:

2) 2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate 'g':

(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
-2s = -30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find 'g'. We'll use the second equation:

s + g = 20
15 + g = 20
g = 5

Therefore, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, which costs $5 per pound. 

To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.20, which equals $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chips: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Next, we add the cost of the bucket of fried chicken and the bottle of soda: $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00
Now, we add the cost of the chips and the other items: $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00

To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"The art of subtraction. It's a delicate dance of numbers, where the goal is to arrive at the correct answer with precision and elegance. In this case, we're dealing with a straightforward problem: finding the number of newspapers delivered to District B.

Let's begin by identifying the total number of newspapers delivered: 600.

We know that 198 newspapers were delivered to District A, and 209 were delivered to District C. To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we must subtract the sum of these two quantities from the total.

The key to this problem lies in the order of operations. We must first add the quantities delivered to District A and District C, and then subtract the result from the total.

So, let's perform the calculation:

600 (total) - (198 + 209)

To add 198 and 209, we can use the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the numbers being added does not change the result. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

600 - 407

Now, we can perform the subtraction:

600 - 400 = 200
200 - 7 = 193

And there you have it. The number of newspapers delivered to District B is 193.

The final answer is: 193"
"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can multiply these numbers together:

4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we can multiply the weekly class time by 6:

8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find the total number of recipes he learns, we can divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe:

48 hours Ã· 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of teachers, as the remaining percentage represents the math teachers.

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the amount of money each person has as variables. Let's say Aurelia has x dollars, Kassidy has (3/4)x dollars, and Rayna has x + 60 dollars.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so we can set up the equation:

x = 120

Now, we can substitute this value into the expressions for Kassidy and Rayna's money:

Kassidy: (3/4)x = (3/4)(120) = 90
Rayna: x + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180

Now, let's add up the money of all three: x + (3/4)x + (x + 60) = 120 + 90 + 180

Combine like terms: (11/4)x + 60 = 390

Subtract 60 from both sides: (11/4)x = 330

Multiply both sides by 4/11: x = 120

Now that we know Aurelia has $120, we can find Kassidy's and Rayna's money:

Kassidy: (3/4)(120) = 90
Rayna: 120 + 60 = 180

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: (120 + 90 + 180) / 3 = 390 / 3 = 130

So, each person would have $130.

Final answer: $130"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

We can break this down into two separate calculations:

1. 4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes
2. Adding the extra 5 minutes to the total time of the regular quarters

The total time of the regular quarters is 48 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to this gives us 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 0.3% of the total employees.

0.3% of 50 = 0.003 * 50 = 0.15

12 Ã· 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total cost of the candies, we need to multiply the quantity of each type by its respective price and then add the results together.

For type A candies, the cost is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
For type B candies, the cost is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, let's break down the information:

We know that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This pattern suggests that the days are alternating between good, bad, and neutral. 

Given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can infer that the pattern will continue. Therefore, the remaining days will follow the alternating pattern.

Since the first 24 days (8 good, 8 bad, and 8 neutral) have been accounted for, we can conclude that the remaining 6 days will be neutral.

Now, let's count the good days: 
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 3 days were good.
- The remaining 6 days will be neutral.

Therefore, the total number of good days in the month is 8 + 3 = 11.

Final answer: $\boxed{11}$"
"To solve for the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

Let's denote the number of days as 'x'. Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can set up the equation: 240 + 30x = 600.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 240 from both sides of the equation: 30x = 360.

Next, we divide both sides by 30: x = 360 / 30.

x = 12.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog needs 1 toy, so he has 4 toys. However, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, making the total number of dogs 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys in total.

When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. However, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the amount Skyler invested, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the amount Dylan invested, which is 2/5 of the total amount. To do this, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 * 2/5 = 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Now, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find this, we multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 * 2/3 = 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:

720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to determine how many signatures they have already collected and then subtract that from their goal.

Let's start by adding the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Now, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100. To do this, we'll subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find Karen's earnings in two days, we need to calculate her hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours she works per day and the number of days.

Karen's hourly wage is twice Lorie's wage, and Lorie earns $10 per hour. Therefore, Karen's hourly wage is 2 x $10 = $20.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 x 3 = $60.

To find her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so we can write the following proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = x potatoes / y hash browns

We can then substitute the given values and solve for y:

6 / 36 = x / y
1 / 6 = x / y

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply:

y = 6x
y = 6 * 96
y = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we can multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cookies each person has as variables: K = Katarina's cookies, M = Max's cookies, S = Cookie Monster's cookies, and Su = Summer's cookies.

We are given the following equations:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = S + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can substitute equation (1) into equation (4) to get:
68 = (S + 12) - 5
68 = S + 7
S = 61

Now that we know S, we can substitute S into equation (2) to find M:
M = 61 + 12
M = 73

Next, we can substitute M into equation (1) to find K:
K = 73 - 5
K = 68

Now that we know M and S, we can find Su:
Su = M + 23
Su = 73 + 23
Su = 96

To find the total number of cookies, we can add the number of cookies each person has:
Total cookies = K + M + S + Su
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original length as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Next, we'll divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To calculate the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can use the weighted average formula. Let's denote the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as T and the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode as R.

We know that Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, so we can set up the following equation:

(T + R) / 2 = (T + R) / 2

However, this equation doesn't help us directly. Instead, we can use the fact that Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode. Let's denote the total time taken to mow the entire lawn as t. Then, we can set up the following equation:

t = (1/2)T + (1/2)R

We are given that T = 60 minutes and R = 40 minutes. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

t = (1/2)(60) + (1/2)(40)
t = 30 + 20
t = 50

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent walking to the corner and the fire station: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total time spent walking from the total time available: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the weight of each item by its respective price per kilo and then add the results together.

For apples, the cost is 1 kilo * $4 per kilo = $4.
For bananas, the cost is 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $4.
For oranges, the cost is 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

The total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies baked, we must first calculate the number of cookies baked by Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

However, the pair eats 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we must subtract 10 from the total number of cookies baked to find the number of cookies left in the box. 

90 - 10 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the age of the younger triplet be x. Since there is one twin who is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7. The age of the other twin is also x + 7, as they are twins. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet ages, as the twins' ages are not necessarily whole numbers. 

The age of the younger triplet is 7 years old.

The age of the older triplet is 14 years old.

The age of the older twin is 14 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time he has before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John has for his homework. He has 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. Adding these together, we get 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the time John has available for a nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of one lollipop as L and the cost of one candy as C.

We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, so we can write the equation:
5L + 4C = 3.20

We also know that 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost an unknown amount, which we'll call X. We can write another equation:
10L + 10C = X

Now, we can solve the first equation for L:
L = (3.20 - 4C) / 5

Substituting this expression for L into the second equation, we get:
10((3.20 - 4C) / 5) + 10C = X

Simplifying the equation, we get:
6.40 - 8C + 10C = X
2C = X - 6.40

Now, we need to find the value of C. We can do this by finding the cost of one candy. Since 4 candies cost $3.20, we can divide $3.20 by 4 to get the cost of one candy:
C = 3.20 / 4
C = 0.80

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can substitute this value back into the equation 2C = X - 6.40:
2(0.80) = X - 6.40
1.60 = X - 6.40
X = 1.60 + 6.40
X = 8.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's yearly savings = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's yearly savings = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings after 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings after 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To determine the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know there are 14 red squares. Then, we are told there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18. 

Next, we are informed that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24. 

Lastly, we are told there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet."
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of regular chairs as R and the number of high chairs as H. We know that the ratio of regular chairs to high chairs is 5:1, so we can write the equation:

R = 5H

We are also given that there are 8 high chairs, so H = 8. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

R = 5(8)
R = 40

The total number of chairs needed is the sum of regular and high chairs, which is 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) + 8 (high chairs) = 65. To find the number of regular chairs needed, we subtract the number of high chairs from the total:

Number of regular chairs = Total chairs - High chairs
= 65 - 8
= 57

Therefore, Mia needs to get 57 more regular chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we can calculate 20% of the total number of bucks. 

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of great grand-babies at a family reunion. To solve this, we can employ the concept of exponentiation. 

We start with the number of children Great Grandma Jones has, which is 3. Each of these children has 3 children of their own, resulting in 3^2 = 9 grandchildren. 

Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, leading to 9 * 3 = 27 great grand-babies. 

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is 27.

**Answer: 27**"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 x $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 x $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can multiply 15 by 20 to get the total number of fireworks in the city.

15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Next, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of fireworks in the city. To do this, we can multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we can multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of fireworks in her backyard.

3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard.

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total. Each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy.

We know that G = 4,000 pounds and Gd = G + 800. We can substitute the value of G into the second equation to get Gd = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds, so we can set up the equation: G + Gd + Gy = 11,600.

Substituting the values of G and Gd into the equation, we get:
4,000 + 4,800 + Gy = 11,600

Combine like terms:
8,800 + Gy = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
Gy = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'x'. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate is 'x + 1'.

We know that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6x. We also know that there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(x + 1).

Since the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is equal to the total number of dumplings cooked, we can set up the equation:

6x + 8(x + 1) = total dumplings

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

6(3) + 8(3 + 1) = total dumplings
18 + 8(4) = total dumplings
18 + 32 = total dumplings
50 = total dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much he had initially. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so his initial amount is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Gerald spent $10, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we can use the concept of ratios. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can set up a ratio of their speeds:

Cat's speed : Turtle's speed = 15 : x
Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can rewrite the ratio as:
15 : x = 5 : 1

To find the value of x, we can cross-multiply:
15 * 1 = 5x
15 = 5x
x = 15 / 5
x = 3

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much they still need to raise. 

They have already raised $2100 and their goal is $6300. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked (3 hours) to find out how much they raise per hour.

$4200 Ã· 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work.

$4200 Ã· $1400 per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes first. 

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."
"To calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to multiply the number of days in 2 weeks by the daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the rates of production for each type of ice cream.

Let's denote the number of quarts of chocolate ice cream produced per hour as C and the number of quarts of vanilla ice cream produced per hour as V. We know that the factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so we can write the equation:

2C = 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

C = 50

We also know that the factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so we can write the equation:

4V = 50

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V = 12.5

Now, we want to find the total number of quarts produced in 48 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

48C + 48V = Total quarts

Substituting the values of C and V, we get:

48(50) + 48(12.5) = Total quarts

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2400 + 600 = Total quarts

Total quarts = 3000

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can analyze the deal as a ratio. The ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free"" offer implies that for every 3 scoops, Erin pays for 2. 

Given that each scoop costs $1.50, we can calculate the total cost per 3 scoops:

$1.50 (scoop 1) + $1.50 (scoop 2) = $3.00

Since Erin has $6.00, we can divide this amount by the cost of 3 scoops to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can afford:

$6.00 Ã· $3.00 = 2

Since each set of 3 scoops contains 3 scoops, Erin can afford 2 sets. Therefore, she can get 2 x 3 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

The correct answer is 6."
"To determine the amount of candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we can multiply the fraction 2/3 by 36. 

First, we multiply the numerator (2) by 36, which gives us 72. 

Then, we divide the result by the denominator (3), which gives us 24.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is 576."
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of picking blueberries, we need to calculate the cost per pound of blueberries when picked versus the cost per pound at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost per pound of blueberries when picked is $65 / 30 pounds = $2.1667 per pound.

In contrast, the cost per pound of blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound.

To find the savings, we can calculate the difference in cost per pound: $2.5 per pound - $2.1667 per pound = $0.3333 per pound.

Therefore, James saves approximately $0.33 per pound by picking blueberries himself.

$0.33"

"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $645.

However, we can simplify this calculation by first finding the cost of the asphalt: 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each is 3 * $25 = $75. Then, we can add the cost of the fine to this result: $75 + $120 = $195. Finally, we add the cost of the damage to the car: $195 + $450 = $645.

Now, we can subtract the total cost from the cost of the fine and asphalt to find the amount of money Ron saves: $645 - $195 = $450.

The final answer is $450."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair: 20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs.

Now, we'll subtract the total number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs: 193 - 33 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Next, we find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. They ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

However, we need to consider that the 4/3 represents 4 out of 3 pizzas, so we can simplify this to 4/3 x 12 = 16 slices per pizza. Since there are 2 pizzas, they ate 16 x 2 = 32 slices.

Now, we find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate Â¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x Â¾ = 1 Â½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 Â½ by 12: 1 Â½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 32 - 18 = 10 slices.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, so the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is (9 * 30 + 9 * 20) / (2 * 9) = (270 + 180) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = 100

To isolate the variable 'x', we'll first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars, we need to find one-fourth of 64. To do this, we can multiply 64 by 1/4 or divide 64 by 4.

64 Ã· 4 = 16

Since each car has 4 windows, we multiply the result by 4 to find the total number of windows smashed for students' cars:

16 * 4 = 64

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for teachers' cars. Hannah smashed three-fourths of the teachers' cars, so we need to find three-fourths of 32. To do this, we can multiply 32 by 3/4 or divide 32 by 4/3.

32 Ã· (4/3) = 32 * (3/4) = 24

Since each teacher's car has 2 windows, we multiply the result by 2 to find the total number of windows smashed for teachers' cars:

24 * 2 = 48

Now, we add the total number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars to find the overall total:

64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of 5000 people voted, we can find this by multiplying 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * 2/5 = 2000

Next, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. We subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, so we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

3000 * 2/3 = 2000

Finally, we find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 days Ã· 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

The correct answer is 8 packs of gum."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we must first calculate the total number of smores required. 

We have 9 kids who want 2 smores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each. The total number of smores needed is 9 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can represent their ages as variables and set up a system of linear equations.

Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given the following information:
1. Dora's age is 15 years: D = 15
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: F = 2D + 8
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: M = F - 4

We can substitute the value of D into the second equation to find F:
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now, we can substitute the values of D and F into the third equation to find M:
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"When dividing a quantity into equal parts, we are essentially finding the quotient. In this scenario, we have a total of $20 and 4 recipients. To determine the amount each recipient will receive, we can use the division operation.

The formula for division is:

In this case, the dividend is $20 and the divisor is 4. 

$20 Ã· 4 = $5

Therefore, each recipient will receive $5."
"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so we have 2 x 2 = 4 pounds for these two books. Adding the weight of the French book, which is 4 pounds, we get 4 + 4 = 8 pounds. Then, we add the weight of the English book, which is 3 pounds, resulting in 8 + 3 = 11 pounds. Finally, we add the weight of the history book, which is twice the weight of the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds. Adding this to the previous total, we get 11 + 6 = 17 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can calculate this as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters:

Total votes = 100
Votes received by A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes
Votes received by C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"The art of subtraction. It's a fundamental operation that requires precision and finesse. Let's tackle this problem with ease.

We're given that Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find Beck's initial amount, we subtract 23 from 100, yielding 77 apples.

Now, Boris decides to give Beck 10 apples. This reduces Boris's total to 100 - 10 = 90 apples. Meanwhile, Beck's total increases by 10, resulting in 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To determine the difference in their current apple counts, we subtract Beck's total from Boris's total: 90 - 87 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"To determine the amount of water left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Finally, let's subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's total as 2x. We are also told that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total:

Alice's total = 10 + 6
Alice's total = 16

Finally, we can find the difference between Clara's total and Alice's total:

Difference = Clara's total - Alice's total
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we can start by using the information that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Let's denote the number of students who like to play basketball as B and the number of students who like to play music as M. We know that B = 5.

Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can express this as M = 2B. Substituting B = 5, we get M = 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and the number of students who like to bake is 10. The number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as V. We can express the total number of students as the sum of the students who like to bake, basketball, music, and video games: 50 = 10 + B + M + V.

Substituting the values of B and M, we get 50 = 10 + 5 + 10 + V. Simplifying the equation, we get 50 = 25 + V. Solving for V, we get V = 50 - 25 = 25.

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds.

1/3 of 12 can be calculated by dividing 12 by 3, which equals 4.

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Initially, there were 12 birds. After 4 were scared away, there were 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Now, the total number of birds is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we can start by finding the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 Ã· 2 = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

40% = 40 Ã· 100 = 0.4

Now, we multiply the total number of students in each class by the decimal equivalent of the percentage of girls.

40 * 0.4 = 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake. Mara added 3 slices, so now the plate has 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, she tripled the number of slices, so now the plate has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Then, she ate 2 slices, so now the plate has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, so now the plate has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."

We have a tomato vendor who sells 500 tomatoes a day. The original cost per tomato is $0.5, and the new vendor offers them for $0.4 each. To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day.

First, let's calculate the original daily cost: 500 tomatoes * $0.5 = $250
Next, we'll calculate the new daily cost: 500 tomatoes * $0.4 = $200

Now, let's find the daily savings: $250 - $200 = $50

To determine the weekly savings, we'll multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350

The answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of marbles Carl has as C, the number of marbles Sean has as S, and the number of marbles Cal has as L.

We know that S = 56 and S = L/2. We can rewrite the second equation as L = 2S. Substituting S = 56 into this equation, we get L = 2(56) = 112.

We also know that C = 4S. Substituting S = 56 into this equation, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding C and L: C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups already required (12). 

Since 54 is not divisible by 12 evenly, we can calculate the quotient and remainder. 

54 Ã· 12 = 4 with a remainder of 6

This means that 4 groups can be formed with 12 students each, but 6 students are left over. To accommodate the remaining students, we need to form additional groups.

Since each group has 12 students, we can divide the remaining 6 students by 12. However, 6 is not divisible by 12 evenly, so we can form 0 additional full groups with 12 students each.

To form groups of 12, we can divide the remaining 6 students into 0 full groups and 6 students into a partial group, but since the question asks for the number of groups, we can conclude that 0 additional full groups are needed.

The answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to consider the varying rental rates during weekdays and weekends.

Let's break it down:

- In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week).
- The rental rate for weekdays is 60 chairs per day, and for weekends, it's 100 chairs per day.

First, calculate the total chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month: 20 weekdays * 60 chairs per weekday = 1200 chairs
Next, calculate the total chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month: 8 weekend days * 100 chairs per weekend day = 800 chairs

Now, add the total chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month: 1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and then add them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of students for each size:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

First, we find 20% of 50 people, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find 60% of the remaining people. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girls. Let's set up a proportion to find the total number of Pomeranians:

1/3 : 6 = 1 : x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
1x = 6 * 3
1x = 18

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 18

However, we want to find the total number of puppies, not just the Pomeranians. Since 2/3 of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another proportion:

2/3 : 18 = 2/3 : x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
2x = 18 * 3/2
2x = 27

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can use the given information to set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of cases the third house needs as x.

We know that the first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, which can be expressed as 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we can set up the proportion:

x = 2 * 125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 250

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 250"

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

Let's break it down:

First, we find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, we add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (45% of bananas) = 290

Therefore, George has a total of 290 fruits.

The final answer is: 290"
"The art of subtraction and division! Let's tackle this problem with precision.

To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. This will give us the remaining amount of money available for the candy bars.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Now, we'll divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars Marissa bought.

Cost of each candy bar = $5
Number of candy bars = Remaining money Ã· Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 Ã· $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required. Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters would require 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram: 20 * 3 = 60.

Therefore, the total cost of making 4 liters of juice is $60."
"To find the total number of books read, we can start by determining the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

The total number of books read is 600.

Final answer: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to consider her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked:
Monday: 4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
Wednesday: 2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
Total hours worked = 20 hours + 4 hours = 24 hours

Since Tanya earns $15 per hour, her total earnings from hourly wage would be:
24 hours * $15 per hour = $360

Next, we need to consider the daily bonus. Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday and 2 classes on Wednesday, she earns the bonus on both days. The total bonus would be:
$5 per day * 2 days = $10

Now, we can calculate her total earnings by adding the hourly wage and the bonus:
Total earnings = $360 + $10 = $370

The final answer is: $370"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

The difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents is 4."
"To find the selling price of each ear of corn, we can set up a linear equation. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as x.

We know that Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = 60. He wants to make a total of $135, and he has 25 ears of corn to sell. Therefore, the total amount he needs to make from corn is 135 - 60 = 75.

Since he has 25 ears of corn, we can set up the equation:

20 * 3 + 25x = 135

To solve for x, we can first simplify the equation:
60 + 25x = 135

Next, we can subtract 60 from both sides:
25x = 75

Finally, we can divide both sides by 25:
x = 75 / 25
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time she has available for leisure activities. 

She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. After reading for 3 hours, she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining. 

Since she spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours as 9 / 3 = 3 hours. 

Now, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend time to find the time spent playing soccer: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils, we can multiply 50 by 1/2 to find the number of pencils given to Brandon.

1/2 * 50 = 25

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Brandon from the total number of pencils Anthony initially had.

50 - 25 = 25

Next, we need to calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find the number of pencils given to Charlie, we multiply the remaining pencils by 3/5.

3/5 * 25 = 15

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time taken to drive back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Jack also spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time he is gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys. 

First, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. 

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left is 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's calculate 20% of $1000:
20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

Therefore, the price after the 20% discount is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:

1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

Since Mike can get these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find out how much the series would cost if they were bought individually. Since a normal movie costs $10, the series would cost:

200 * $10 = $2000

But Mike can get them for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, so we need to divide the cost by 6:

$2000 / 6 = $333.33

Next, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:

0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

Since these older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies that are not in series or older movies. Since there are 400 movies left, and 160 are older movies, we subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

These movies cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. So, we can calculate the cost of these movies:

240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33"
"To find the total amount spent on fruit, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the weight of each type of fruit by its respective price per pound. 

For peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
For plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
For apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

We know that the family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. However, we are also given that they hiked at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We can express the hiking speed in terms of the driving speed:
h = (d / 2) - 5

We are also given that the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Since the distance is the same for both driving and hiking, we can set up the following equation:
6 = d
and
1.5 = h

Now, we can substitute the value of 'd' into the equation for 'h':
1.5 = (6 / 2) - 5
1.5 = 3 - 5
1.5 = -2

This equation is inconsistent, which means that the given information is contradictory. However, we can still find the distance by using the driving speed:
Distance = d * Time
Distance = 6 * 50
Distance = 300 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 300 miles.

"To find the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, while Emma's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on. Let's represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on as x. Then, Ava jumps on 8 + x enemies.

We also know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 5 times the number of berries she has, while Ava collects 5 times the number of berries she has. Let's represent the number of berries Emma collects as y. Then, Ava collects y - 3 berries.

Lastly, we know that Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Emma finishes the level in 30 - t seconds, while Ava finishes the level in 30 + t seconds. Let's represent the time it takes Emma to finish the level as t.

Using the given information, we can set up the following equations:

Ava's score: A = 10(8 + x) + 5(y - 3) + 30(30 + t)
Emma's score: E = 10x + 5y + 30(30 - t)

We are also given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so x = 8 + y. We can substitute this into the equation for Emma's score:

E = 10(8 + y) + 5y + 30(30 - t)
E = 80 + 10y + 5y + 900 - 30t
E = 980 + 15y - 30t

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for y and t by substituting x = 8 + y into Ava's score equation:

A = 10(8 + 8 + y) + 5(y - 3) + 30(30 + t)
A = 10(16 + y) + 5y - 15 + 30(30 + t)
A = 160 + 10y + 5y - 15 + 900 + 30t
A = 1045 + 15y + 30t

Now we have two equations:

E = 980 + 15y - 30t
A = 1045 + 15y + 30t

We can solve for y and t by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

A - E = (1045 + 15y + 30t) - (980 + 15y - 30t)
A - E = 65 + 60t

Since we are looking for the difference in scores, we can set t = 0 to find the difference in points:

A - E = 65

The final answer is: 65"

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 
So, the total number of times for these 2 days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:
15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

**The final answer is 27.**"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Since the total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x, and the total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 1 + 2x

Subtracting x from both sides:

4 = 1 + x

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3 = x

However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we can't buy a fraction of a fish. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Since the total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x, and the total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 1 + 2(3 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

4 + x = 6 + 2x

Subtracting x from both sides:

4 = 6 + x

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

-2 = x

This solution also doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we can't buy a negative number of fish. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

Simplifying the equation:

4 + x = 2(17)

4 + x = 34

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

x = 30

This solution makes sense in the context of the problem, as we can buy 30 white fish.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption and cost for Andy's car, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Distance driven per day: Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day.

2. Total miles driven per week: 
Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

3. Fuel efficiency: Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

4. Fuel price: The current price for regular gas is $3 per gallon.

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week and the cost of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

Therefore, Andy's car consumes 5 gallons of gas per week and costs $15 per week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we can multiply 10 by 3/5. 

First, we multiply 10 by 3: 10 * 3 = 30. 

Then, we divide 30 by 5: 30 Ã· 5 = 6.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply 140 by $0.25 to find the total amount she spent on the quarters.

140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is $155."

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To determine the number of logs needed to maintain a temperature above freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. To find the temperature at night, we subtract 33 from 45: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log provides a 5-degree increase in temperature, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 Ã· 5 = 2.4.

To maintain a temperature above freezing, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups. We can do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people in each group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we can find the number of groups with seashells by multiplying the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2

"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break down her work into regular hours and overtime hours. 

First, we calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 11 hours in total, the overtime hours are 11 - 8 = 3 hours. Her special hourly rate for overtime is 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. 

For 3 hours of overtime, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

Final answer: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first calculate the number of male lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the concept of linear growth. 

The company starts with 200 employees and adds 20 new employees every month. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20. 

The total number of employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

The total number of employees after three months is 260.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total salary paid per month is 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.

To find the total salary paid after three months, we multiply the total salary paid per month by 3:

$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to calculate the total time for each song and then add them together.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, so we multiply 150 by 2 to get 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so we keep it as 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then compare their total earnings.

First, we find Billy's hourly wage after each raise. His initial hourly wage was $10. After a $0.50 increase, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received a $1.00 increase, making his new wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings are $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. As she also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"The problem at hand involves comparing the cost of two distinct items: a loaf of bread and a bagel. We are given the prices of these items: $2 for a loaf of bread and $1 for a bagel.

To determine the difference in cost, we must calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. 

First, we'll calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread: 3 x $2 = $6. 

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 2 bagels: 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we'll subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To find the total score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total score of both Pierson and Nikita. 
Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the contributions of both students and teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:

40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. To find the total number of teachers, we multiply the number of classes by the number of teachers per class:

40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by adding the number of trees planted by students and teachers:

1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = 10.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals, then the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days. To find the total hours played in the first 2 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days. To find the total hours played in the last week, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Now, we add the total hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week to find the total hours played so far: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. To find the hours still needed to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will be ahead of the first car. 

Let's denote the speed of the first car as v1 and the speed of the second car as v2. We know that v2 = 70 mph and v1 = 60 mph. 

The relative speed between the two cars is the difference between their speeds, which is v2 - v1 = 70 - 60 = 10 mph.

The time elapsed is 2 hours. The distance between the two cars can be calculated using the formula: Distance = Relative Speed * Time.

Distance = 10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to find 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $900. 

First, we find 30% of $900 by multiplying $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's start by finding the number of fifth-graders who passed. Since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, we can calculate it as follows:

Fifth-graders who passed = 2 * 40 = 80

Now, we can find the total number of students who passed by adding the number of students who passed in each grade:

Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, we can find the total number of students in the school by adding the number of students in each grade:

Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total number of square inches that can be created with the available glass chips. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we can find the total number of square inches by dividing the total number of chips by 12. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, resulting in 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea can be found by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has. 

Dale initially had 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. 

However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Since Dale wants to sell all of his candies, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x = 50, where x is the number of candies he still needs to sell.

The answer is 50."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(2^n)

where:
A = final amount
P = initial amount (10 students)
n = number of periods (5 months, from January to May)

We can calculate the total number of students at the end of May as follows:

A = 10(2^5)
A = 10(32)
A = 320

Since we want to find the additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total:

Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May is 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). This will give us the total number of branches he climbed in a week.

$105 Ã· $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

420 branches Ã· 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"To calculate the total number of petals in the vase, we need to consider the number of petals for each type of flower and account for the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we must first calculate the total number of marshmallows available for use. 

The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows, but 3 were dropped. Therefore, the number of marshmallows remaining is 35 - 3 = 32.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores that can be made is equal to the number of marshmallows remaining, which is 32.

John and DeSean made a combined total of 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

32 Ã· 2 = 16

Therefore, each kid can have 16 S'mores."
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we need to calculate the time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's start by finding the time each person played. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's represent the amount of salt as x, the amount of citrus zest as x, the amount of fragrance as x, and the amount of oil as 2x.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of goats by the cost per goat and the number of cows by the cost per cow, then add the results together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the costs together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of cupcakes he already possesses. This can be done by adding the number of chocolate cupcakes and toffee cupcakes.

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Next, we subtract the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed to find out how many more he should purchase.

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already has) = 15

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars Joe has as 'x'. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can write an equation: x = 2 * 20. Solving for x, we get x = 40.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars. So, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, to find the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from the number he had after selling: 32 - 16 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the amount each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and the amount raised by organizations is $50,000. 

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 Ã· 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate this as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time walked on both days to find the total time:
Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we can divide 70 by 2, which equals 35. This means 35 cars left the parking lot.

To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to multiply the number of tasks he completes in a day by the number of days in a week, and then multiply the result by the pay per task.

First, we multiply the number of tasks per day (30) by the number of days in a week (7):

30 * 7 = 210

Next, we multiply the result by the pay per task ($1.20):

210 * $1.20 = $252

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $252.

The final answer is: $252"
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

Now, we need to find Sasha's score in the second game. We know she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total tins of each type of food.

The total number of tins of cat food is 8 * 11 = 88.

The total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cards each person has using variables. Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to break down the information given. We know she had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we can calculate the number of blue eggs as 2 * 5 = 10. 

Next, we're told she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9. Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which gives us 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is calculated as follows:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's original price:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Therefore, Milly will lose $8.

$8"
"To calculate the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to consider the initial amount she had, the amount her father gave her, and the total amount she spent.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

**The final answer is 60.**"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

The first week's production is 8,000 bars. The second week's production is half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week's production is three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. To find the production for the fourth week, we subtract this from the total monthly production.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Next, we need to convert the time spent doing makeup from minutes to hours: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Now, we add the time spent on each activity: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The base price for the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has the following additional items:
- 2 mirrors
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:
- Mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is the base price plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To determine the amount of money Roy has, we need to understand the relationships between the amounts saved by Anthony and Eva. 

First, we know that Eva has $20. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings by adding $10 to Eva's amount: $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we're told that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's amount by 0.4: 0.4 * $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total: $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Roy has $42.

"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to establish a chain of ratios between the heights lifted by each individual.

We know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. Let's denote the height Kagiyami can lift as x. Then, Naruto can lift 10x.

We also know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, we can express this as x = 4y, where y is the height Saskay can lift.

Lastly, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift 1 inch. Therefore, y = 12 inches.

Now, we can substitute y = 12 into the equation x = 4y to find the height Kagiyami can lift: x = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Since Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance traveled, we can utilize the fundamental principles of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the speed (8 miles per hour) by the time (4 hours) to determine the distance covered in the initial 4-hour period: 8 * 4 = 32 miles.

Next, we multiply the speed (8 miles per hour) by the time (6 hours) to determine the distance covered in the subsequent 6-hour period: 8 * 6 = 48 miles.

Finally, we add the distances covered in both periods to obtain the total distance traveled: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time for kangaroos = 18 hours
Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
18 = Distance / 3
Distance = 18 * 3
Distance = 54

Now we can find the time it will take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Time for turtles = 54 / 3
Time for turtles = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 18 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, the number of dishes made by Rory as R, and the number of dishes made by Jada as J.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes, so K = 20.

We also know that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so J = 2R = 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can find the total number of dishes made by adding the number of dishes made by each of them: Total = K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"The art of subtraction and addition! Let's dive into the world of numbers and uncover the secrets of Erika's savings.

We know that Erika's new laptop costs $600, and trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200, making it $400. She's also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. To find out how much she has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining the constants on the left side:

x + 230 = 350

To isolate x, we'll subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total number of apple slices, we can calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, let's find the number of slices from the large apples: 3 apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's find the number of slices from the small apples: 5 apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate from the total: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the total milk production of 'x' cows would be 5x liters. We want this to be equal to 25 liters.

5x = 25

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

We know that the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters. 

For the first glue stick, 1/6 of the stick is left, so the length of the stick that is not used is 12 mm * (1 - 1/6) = 12 mm * 5/6 = 10 mm.

For the second glue stick, 2/3 of the stick is left, so the length of the stick that is not used is 12 mm * (1 - 2/3) = 12 mm * 1/3 = 4 mm.

For the third glue stick, 1/2 of the stick is left, so the length of the stick that is not used is 12 mm * (1 - 1/2) = 12 mm * 1/2 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. This can be done by adding the cost of the car and the phone.

Total cost = $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800

Next, we must calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. This can be achieved by adding the amount he earned from working on weekends to the amount his brother gave him.

Total amount = $5,000 (earned from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200

Now, we can find the amount Gabriel still needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the total cost of the items.

Amount Gabriel still needs = Total cost - Total amount
= $10,800 - $5,200
= $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To calculate the change Thea received, we need to multiply the number of $20 bills she paid with by the value of each bill, then subtract the cost of the hat.

The total amount paid is 4 * $20 = $80. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat, $70, from the total amount paid, $80.

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's use S to represent the number of socks Peter has and D to represent the number of dishes he has.

From the problem statement, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we can write an equation:
S = 2J

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can write another equation:
D = 0.5J

We are also given that Jack has 60 dishes, so we can substitute 60 for D in the second equation:
60 = 0.5J

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
120 = J

Now that we know Jack has 120 socks, we can substitute 120 for J in the first equation:
S = 2(120)
S = 240

Now that we know Peter has 240 socks and Jack has 120 socks, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total = S + D
Total = 240 + 120
Total = 360

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 360."
"To find the total number of students good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

We know that the total number of students is 20, the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8. We can set up the following equation:

M + E - B = 20

We also know that the number of students good at math only is M - B, and the number of students good at English only is E - B. Substituting these values, we get:

M - B + E - B = 5 + 8
M + E - 2B = 13

Now, we can add the equation M + E - B = 20 to the equation M + E - 2B = 13:

2M + 2E - 3B = 33

We also know that the number of students good at both math and English is B. Since the number of students good at math is M, the number of students good at English is E, and the number of students good at both is B, we can write:

M = B + 5 (math only)
E = B + 8 (English only)

Substituting these values into the equation 2M + 2E - 3B = 33, we get:

2(B + 5) + 2(B + 8) - 3B = 33
2B + 10 + 2B + 16 - 3B = 33
B + 26 = 33

Solving for B, we get:

B = 7

Now that we know the number of students good at both math and English, we can find the total number of students good at math:

M = B + 5
= 7 + 5
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. 

First, we subtract the time taken for the intermission from the total time of the concert: 
Total time of the concert = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Available time for performances = Total time of the concert - Intermission time
= 120 minutes - 10 minutes
= 110 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time taken by each group:
Time taken by each group = 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting the stage)
= 10 minutes

Now, we divide the available time for performances by the time taken by each group to find the number of groups that can perform:
Number of groups = Available time for performances / Time taken by each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

The correct answer is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we can use a straightforward approach.

First, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the two subsets. The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold, and then multiply the result by the price per tray.

Let's perform the calculations:

900 eggs Ã· 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays Ã— $2.5 per tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Let's start with Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. To find the number of goats left, we subtract 10 from the initial number of goats in Farm X, which is 55. 

55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's move on to Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract 20 from the initial number of goats in Farm Y, which is 45.

45 - 20 = 25

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

The total amount spent per year is $2640, and James buys 2 pairs per year. 

To divide $2640 by 2, we can use the division algorithm. 

$2640 Ã· 2 = $1320

Therefore, the average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 
3 * $25 = $75

Next, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
3 * $18 = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 can be expressed as 90 Ã· 2. 

90 Ã· 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes Ã· 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we'll find the number of homes built in the first year, which is given as 12.

Next, we'll calculate the number of homes built in the second year. Since they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, we multiply 12 by 3, which equals 36.

In the third year, the town will double the number of homes built in the first two years. To do this, we add the number of homes built in the first two years (12 + 36) and then multiply the result by 2. This gives us 2 * 48 = 96.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the given information as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:

- Let x be the age of the speaker.
- Let y be the age of the brother.
- Let z be the age of the sister.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. x = y - 3 (since the speaker is 3 years younger than the brother)
2. x = z + 2 (since the speaker is 2 years older than the sister)
3. 3y + 8 = z (since the speaker's mom is one less than three times the brother's age)

We can rewrite equation (3) as z = 3y + 8.

Now, substitute the expression for z from equation (3) into equation (2):

x = (3y + 8) + 2
x = 3y + 10

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1. x = y - 3
2. x = 3y + 10

Since both equations are equal to x, we can set them equal to each other:

y - 3 = 3y + 10

Subtract y from both sides:

-3 = 2y + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-13 = 2y

Divide by 2:

-6.5 = y

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value to find the other ages.

Now, substitute the value of y into equation (1) to find the speaker's age:

x = y - 3
x = -6.5 - 3
x = -9.5

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can use the exact value to find the other ages.

Now, substitute the value of y into equation (3) to find the brother's age:

z = 3y + 8
z = 3(-6.5) + 8
z = -19.5 + 8
z = -11.5

Again, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can use the exact value to find the other ages.

Now, substitute the value of y into equation (2) to find the sister's age:

x = z + 2
x = -11.5 + 2
x = -9.5

Again, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can use the exact value to find the other ages.

However, the question asks for the speaker's age. 

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs, we can divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).

27 Ã· 8 = 3.375

Since we're dealing with whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student receives 2 glue sticks. The next whole number after 3.375 is 4.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we need to consider the initial amount and the increase in water flow.

The amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day, which means it is 2 times the initial amount. So, 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount, we need to add the initial doubled amount and the increase. 

8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"To model the exponential growth of the infected population, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the initial population (P) is 10, the growth rate (r) is 6 (since each person infects 6 others), and the time (t) is 3 days.

The formula for compound interest is: P * (1 + r)^t

Plugging in the values, we get: 10 * (1 + 6)^3
= 10 * (7)^3
= 10 * 343
= 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we need to first find the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of what Rafaela received. To find 90% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.9. 
$800 * 0.9 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"The art of subtraction. It's a delicate dance of numbers, where we carefully remove the unwanted elements to reveal the hidden truth. In this case, we're dealing with a simple yet elegant problem.

Let's begin by identifying the total number of oranges Jennifer initially purchased. We're told she bought 12 oranges.

Next, we need to account for the oranges she distributed among her children. Three daughters received 2 oranges each, which amounts to 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Additionally, her son received 3 oranges. The total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9.

Now, to find the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we'll subtract the total given away from the initial amount:

12 - 9 = 3

The answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of badges earned by each girl. Let's denote the number of badges Claire earns per month as C, Amber as A, and Wendy as W.

We know that Claire earns 1 badge per month, so C = 1. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, we can express Amber's badge earnings as A = C/2 = 1/2. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so W = 3C = 3.

Now, we need to find the number of badges each girl earns in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly badge earnings by 12.

Claire's yearly badge earnings: 1 * 12 = 12 badges
Amber's yearly badge earnings: (1/2) * 12 = 6 badges
Wendy's yearly badge earnings: 3 * 12 = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the total number of slices baked and sold. Since Paige baked 2 loaves per hour and worked for 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is 2 * 5 = 10. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we can calculate the total amount raised by multiplying the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. So, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70.

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30.

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students and then subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 

Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10
Total burritos given to students = 500

Next, we subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos given to the students.

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 480."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's use R for the number of red cars, G for the number of green cars, and Y for the number of yellow cars.

We are given the following information:

1. The rink has 12 red cars, so R = 12.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so G = R - 2.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so B = 3G.
4. The total number of cars is 75, so R + G + B + Y = 75.

We can substitute the expressions for R and B into the total equation:

12 + (12 - 2) + 3(12 - 2) + Y = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

Combine like terms:

52 + Y = 75

Subtract 52 from both sides:

Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method.

Let's say Fawn has x books, Anne has y books, and Sofie has z books. We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

We are also given that together, they have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now we can substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = x - 12
y = 28 - 12
y = 16

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can find the value of z:

z = y + 25
z = 16 + 25
z = 41

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes by multiplying 5 by 2, which equals 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes, which is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the price per box.

First, we calculate the total number of cups needed by multiplying the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will receive:

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find the number of boxes required:

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost:

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the change, we need to find the difference between the amount given ($4000) and the total cost of the phones ($3500). 

The change can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we need to calculate 40% of the total monthly cost of $400. 

40% of $400 can be calculated as 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find Keenan's weekly expenditure. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, we'll find 2/5 of 60 pieces:
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

Next, we'll subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total:
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

Then, we'll find 7/13 of the remaining 36 pieces:
7/13 * 36 = (7 * 36) / 13 = 252 / 13 = 19.3846 (approximately)

Since we can't eat a fraction of a piece, we'll round down to 19 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 19 = 53 pieces

Tobias has eaten 53 pieces so far.

**The final answer is 53.**"
"To find the total cost, we can use the concept of proportionality. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so we can find the cost of 1 bottle of soda by dividing $21.00 by 7.

$21.00 Ã· 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by the number of bottles David wants to buy, which is 3.

$3.00 per bottle Ã— 3 bottles = $9.00

We also know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so we can find the cost of 1 bottle of water by dividing $8.00 by 4.

$8.00 Ã· 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of water by the number of bottles David wants to buy, which is 2.

$2.00 per bottle Ã— 2 bottles = $4.00

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find the amount of money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, we can multiply 0.03 by 16 to find the total cost:

0.03 * 16 = 0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked: $33 Ã· 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend, we can simply add 52 (initial marbles) and 28 (additional marbles).

52 + 28 = 80

However, Paul then loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we can multiply 80 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 80 by 4.

80 Ã· 4 = 20

Now, we subtract the lost marbles from the total:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To calculate Amy's total score, we can use weighted averages. We assign weights to each type of question based on their point values and frequencies.

Multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each and there are 10 of them, so the weight is 1 * 10 = 10. Since Amy answers 80% of these correctly, she scores 0.8 * 10 = 8 points.

True/false questions are worth 1 point each and there are 20 of them, so the weight is 1 * 20 = 20. Since Amy answers 90% of these correctly, she scores 0.9 * 20 = 18 points.

Long-answer questions are worth 5 points each and there are 5 of them, so the weight is 5 * 5 = 25. Since Amy answers 60% of these correctly, she scores 0.6 * 25 = 15 points.

To find the total score, we add the weighted scores: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the cost of each chicken, we first need to find the total number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180 chickens.

The selling price per chicken is $50, and Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens, we subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Selling Price * Number of Chickens Sold
Total Revenue = $50 * 180
Total Revenue = $9000

Total Cost = Total Revenue - Desired Profit
Total Cost = $9000 - $2000
Total Cost = $7000

Now, to find the cost per chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold:

Cost per Chicken = Total Cost / Number of Chickens Sold
Cost per Chicken = $7000 / 180
Cost per Chicken = $38.89

The final answer is $38.89."
"To find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade.

32 glasses Ã· 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find the difference, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is 20 * 1.5 = $30.

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has 20 * 2 = $40.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the number of years when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

In 16 years, her age will be x + 16. According to the problem, this age will be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation:

x + 16 = 3x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:

16 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age by subtracting her present age from 24 (which is thrice her present age):

24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we'll find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, the cost of each packet of chicken is 2 x $10 = $20. With 6 packets of chicken, the total cost is 6 x $20 = $120.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost is 3 x $4 = $12.

Now, we'll find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs of apples, the total cost is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
$65 - $156 = -$91

Since the result is negative, Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items."
"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as x. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the total runtime of the final concert as 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the number of toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys.

The total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

To find the remaining number of toys, we subtract 150 from 200.

200 - 150 = 50

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made on each day and then add them together.

The number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is 125 + 125 = 250. 

Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays, we can calculate this as 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs.

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

So, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply 2/3 by the number of birds in the bushes (6). 

2/3 * 6 = (2 * 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to get the total.

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"To find the number of cookies in each jar, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars. 

We start by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the initial total: 55 - 5 = 50.

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars: 50 Ã· 5 = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be found by multiplying the number of orchids (5) by the number of petals per orchid (5), which equals 25 petals.

The total number of petals on the daisies can be found by multiplying the number of daisies (4) by the number of petals per daisy (10), which equals 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4. This can be calculated as 100 * 0.25, which equals 25.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3. This can be calculated as 75 * 0.67, which equals 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportionality relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the whirligig as W, the speed of the whatchamacallit as M, and the speed of the thingamabob as T.

We know that the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so we can write the equation: M = 11T.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 121 = 11T.

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11: T = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we can write the equation: W = 5T.

Substituting the value of T, we get: W = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as x. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the total cost of carrots is 2x. The cost of the salad is $6, and the cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3.

We know that the total cost of all her goods is $11. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine like terms:

2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides:

2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 1

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

$1"
"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week.

First, we multiply the new hourly wage ($12) by the number of hours worked per day (8):

$12 * 8 = $96

Next, we multiply the result by the number of days worked per week (5):

$96 * 5 = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x, Kamala's lawn as 3x, and Alba's lawn as 5x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80, and Joe paid her $6 for his lawn. This gives us the equation:

6x = 80 - 6 (since Joe paid $6, we subtract this from the total amount earned from mowing lawns)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6x = 74

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 74 / 6
x = 12.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 12.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 12 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 12 = 60 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 12 + 36 + 60 = 6 * 12 + 96 = 6 * 108 = 648

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
648 - 80 = 568

The final answer is: 568"
"To determine Harry's weight, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so we add 16 to 55 to find Carl's weight: 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so we add 8 to 71 to find Christian's weight: 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Lastly, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, so we subtract 5 from 79 to find Harry's weight: 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to multiply the number of hours he rents his car per month (10 hours) by the hourly rate ($25) and then subtract his car payment ($500).

First, let's calculate the total earnings: 10 hours * $25/hour = $250
Now, subtract the car payment: $250 - $500 = -$250

However, since we're looking for profit, we're interested in the positive value. To find the profit, we can subtract the absolute value of the car payment from the total earnings: $250 - $500 = -$250. To get the positive profit, we can multiply the absolute value of the car payment by -1: -$250 * -1 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation:

3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2.33 = 4.67

Since the question asks for the difference in the number of notebooks, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the exact difference is 4.67, which is more than 4 but less than 5."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
= 50 + (1/5 * 50)
= 50 + 10
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
= 50 + 60
= 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by each of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the ratio of adult to child bowls. Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This means the ratio of adult to child bowls is 4:8, which simplifies to 1:2.

Since Calvin is an adult, his bowl will be counted as one unit. His wife and two children will be counted as three units. In total, there are four units (1 adult + 3 children). 

Now, we need to divide the total number of child bowls (8) by the total number of units (4). 

8 Ã· 4 = 2

So, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount spent, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. 

We can multiply the cost of one notebook ($1.50) by the number of notebooks (5) to get the total cost of the notebooks: $1.50 * 5 = $7.50

Then, we add the cost of the ballpen ($0.50) to the total cost of the notebooks: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total material needed, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's use 'x' to represent the yards of material needed for small masks and 'y' to represent the yards of material needed for large masks.

We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, so the ratio of material to small masks is 2:4 or 1:2. This can be expressed as an equation: x = 2y/2, which simplifies to x = y.

We also know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, so the ratio of material to large masks is 2.25:3 or 3:4. This can be expressed as an equation: y = (2.25*4)/3, which simplifies to y = 3.

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into the equation x = y to find the value of x: x = 3.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for small and large masks: x + y = 3 + 3 = 6 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216, and the total number of tickets is 27. 

We can set up the division problem as follows: 

$216 Ã· 27 = ?

To solve this, we can use the concept of repeated subtraction. 

$216 - $72 = $144
$144 - $72 = $72
$72 - $72 = $0

Since we have reached $0, we can stop the process. 

The result of the division is $216 Ã· 27 = $8.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day, which is 24. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, we add up the hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The total number of shoe boxes left is 4 + 6 = 10."
"To find the number of books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply Sarah's number of books by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total marbles given away and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, we calculate 1/5 of 30, which is equivalent to 6. Then, we add the 10 marbles given to Donald, resulting in a total of 16 marbles given away.

Now, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the given information as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Duncan's current age as 'D' and Adam's current age as 'A'. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be represented as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. We can use this information to substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can solve for A by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2 to find A:

A = 60 / 2
A = 30

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam's age in 8 years will be 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical 8-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes and then multiply it by his hourly rate.

First, we know that Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we subtract 10 from 50 to find his hourly rate: 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Next, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the total number of packages by his hourly rate: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

The normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and the extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes to determine the number of bottles he drinks. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 225 minutes is equal to 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.

To find the number of bottles, we can divide the total time by 0.5 hours (since he drinks a bottle every half hour). 

Number of bottles of water: 3.75 hours / 0.5 hours = 7.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the variables x to represent the number of red balloons and y to represent the number of yellow balloons.

Since there are 20 red balloons, we can write the equation:
x = 20

We also know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We can write the equation:
2x + 3y = 58

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

x = 20
2x + 3y = 58

We can substitute x = 20 into the second equation to solve for y:
2(20) + 3y = 58
40 + 3y = 58
3y = 18
y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can calculate the total miles driven in 30 days and then divide by the interval at which he needs a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives a total of 100 * 30 = 3000 miles. 

Now, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up, which is 1000 miles. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that the total amount spent on the cake and ice cream is $18. We also know that the cost of 1 dozen balloons is $6. 

Let's denote the cost of 2 balloons as $x. Since 1 dozen balloons is 12, we can set up the equation: 12x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 0.5. 

Now, we know that 2 balloons cost $0.5, so 1 balloon costs $0.25. 

The total amount spent on the cake and ice cream is $18, and the total amount spent on balloons is $6. We can set up an equation to represent the total amount spent: 18 + 6 + 2y = 24, where y is the amount of money they had initially. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 24 + 2y = 24. Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get 2y = 0. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 0. 

Since y represents the amount of money they had initially, we can conclude that Julia and Nadine had $0 each.

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-examine the equation 12x = 6. We can see that x = 0.5 is not the cost of 1 balloon, but rather the cost of 2 balloons. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that 1 dozen balloons costs $6, and they bought 1 dozen balloons. So, the total amount spent on balloons is $6. 

The total amount spent on the cake and ice cream is $18. We can set up an equation to represent the total amount spent: 18 + 6 = 24. 

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially. 

$24 / 2 = $12.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12.

$12"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left, we must first calculate the initial total. 

The initial total is the sum of the individual quantities of each fruit: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Next, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate, which is 2. 

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

First, we have 6 students playing tennis. Then, we have twice that number playing volleyball, which is 2 * 6 = 12. 

Next, we have 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first determine the total revenue generated from the sale of lollipops. 

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, and the cost price is $0.5. The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

The total number of lollipops sold is 30 students * 10 lollipops per student = 300 lollipops.

The total revenue is the selling price per lollipop multiplied by the total number of lollipops sold, which is $0.8 * 300 = $240.

The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - (30 * $0.5) = $240 - $15 = $225.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $225 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$225"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs by multiplying the number of cats by 3: 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're told Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. To find the number of rabbits, we subtract 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, we multiply the number of rabbits by 3 to find the number of fish: 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

Lastly, Larry's gerbil collection is 1/3 the number of fish he has. To find the number of gerbils, we multiply the number of fish by 1/3: 21 * 1/3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh.

Abby's daily consumption is 2 slices, and Josh's consumption is twice that amount, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of their individual consumption: 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):
24 Ã· 6 = 4

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of shells collected by Martha over a period of time. We're given that she starts collecting shells at the age of 5 and continues until her 10th birthday. To find the total number of shells collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can start by subtracting the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups: 27 - 15 = 12.

Since the cups are divided into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. However, we must consider the possibility of a remainder. 

In this case, 12 divided by 3 equals 4 with no remainder. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the total time available (8 hours) and then by the time it takes for a round trip (4 hours).

First, we divide the total number of berries by the total time: 24 berries / 8 hours = 3 berries per hour.

Since the sloth makes a round trip in 4 hours, we then divide the hourly rate by the time it takes for a round trip: 3 berries per hour / 4 hours per round trip = 0.75 berries per trip.

The final answer is 0.75."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we calculate half of the pool's water, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons. This is the initial amount of water in the tank.

Next, we need to determine how much water is used from the tank each day. The problem states that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

To find the total amount of water used in 6 days, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days: 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank: 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for his previous movie outings and purchases.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $10 on a Friday ticket, $8 on popcorn, and $8 on candy, for a total of $26. Subtracting this from his allowance, we get $150 - $26 = $124.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $124 - $10 = $114 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. 

$114 / $10 = 11.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 11 movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{11}$"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to determine the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

First, we find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by dividing the calories of a normal cinnamon roll by 3. This gives us 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by dividing the calories of a normal blueberry muffin by 3. This gives us 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories of the pastries by multiplying the number of each type by their respective calorie values and adding them together: 
(200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories) + (300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories) = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

First, we'll calculate the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since Rita removed twice as many Junebugs on these two days as she did on Monday, we can multiply the number of Junebugs removed on Monday by 2.

Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 * Junebugs removed on Monday
= 2 * 39
= 78

Now, we'll add up the total number of Junebugs removed on all five days:

Junebugs removed on Monday = 39
Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78
Junebugs removed on Thursday = 48
Junebugs removed on Friday = 57

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57
= 222

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 222 / 5
= 44.4

The final answer is 44.4."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 x 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 x 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The correct answer is 60 miles."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys Sophie now has and the total number of toys she already had.

Let's break it down:

Total number of toys Sophie now has: 62
Total number of toys Sophie already had: 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has:

62 - 48 = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can start by writing the given information as a system of linear equations:

Let P be Peter's age, J be John's age, and P + 10 be Paul's age.

We have two equations:

1) P + (P + 10) + J = 100
2) P = (P + 10) + J

We can simplify equation (1) by combining like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J from equation (2) into equation (1):

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now we have a simplified system of linear equations:

1) P + J = 35
2) P = (P + 10) + J

We can solve for P by substituting P = (P + 10) + J into equation (1):

((P + 10) + J) + J = 35

Combine like terms:

P + 10 + 2J = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 25

Now, we have two equations:

1) P + J = 35
2) P + 2J = 25

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(J) = -10

Substitute J = -10 into equation (1):

P + (-10) = 35

Add 10 to both sides:

P = 45

Now that we have found P, we can find J by substituting P into one of the original equations:

45 + J = 35

Subtract 45 from both sides:

J = -10

However, this solution is not valid since age cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the system of equations.

We can rewrite equation (2) as:

P = J + 10

Substitute this expression for P into equation (1):

(J + 10) + J = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2J = 25

Divide both sides by 2:

J = 12.5

Now that we have found J, we can find P by substituting J into one of the original equations:

P = J + 10

P = 12.5 + 10

P = 22.5

Since the problem states that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, we can verify our solution:

P + (P + 10) + J = 22.5 + (22.5 + 10) + 12.5 = 55.5 + 55.5 = 111

This is not equal to 100, which means our solution is incorrect. However, we can try to find another solution.

Let's re-examine the system of equations:

1) P + J = 35
2) P = J + 10

We can rewrite equation (2) as:

P = J + 10

Substitute this expression for P into equation (1):

(J + 10) + J = 35

Combine like terms:

2J + 10 = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2J = 25

Divide both sides by 2:

J = 12.5

Now that we have found J, we can find P by substituting J into one of the original equations:

P = J + 10

P = 12.5 + 10

P = 22.5

Since the problem states that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, we can verify our solution:

P + (P + 10) + J = 22.5 + (22.5 +"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

Adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons, the total number of balloons is 9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables needed, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. 

We know that 10 people donated 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, the charity group already owns 10 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we can find the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This gives us 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To calculate the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds (40) by the distance each seed is spat (10 feet): 
40 * 10 = 400 feet

To calculate the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds (35) by the distance each seed is spat (12 feet): 
35 * 12 = 420 feet

To find the total distance spat by both, we add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total production and revenue for each machine over a 30-day period.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and operates for 24 hours a day. Its daily production is 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1,440 widgets/day. Over 30 days, it produces 1,440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and operates for 24 hours a day. Its daily production is 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours = 1,080 widgets/day. Over 30 days, it produces 1,080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000.

To find the difference in earnings between the two machines, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Cameron's stay, let's analyze the pricing structure of the hotel.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors can add 70 pesos for every additional hour.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since he's staying beyond the initial 12-hour mark, he'll incur an additional charge for the extra hours.

To calculate the cost of the extended stay, we need to find out how many hours Cameron will be staying beyond the 12-hour mark. Since he's leaving at 10 am, he'll be staying for 5 hours after 12 pm (midnight). Therefore, he'll be staying for 5 hours beyond the initial 12-hour mark.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

Now, let's compare the costs:

- 12-hour stay: 1000 pesos
- Extended stay (12 hours + 5 hours): 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

Since the 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos, Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by opting for the extended stay."
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal requires and then add them together.

First, we find the amount of hay each goat needs, which is 5 pounds. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the overall total, we add the hay needed for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 159 pounds."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we first calculate his total earnings. 

John earns 50 dollars per hour and worked for 6 hours, resulting in a total of 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He then spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

Next, he buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, totaling 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After this purchase, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars remaining.

John aims to deposit 100 dollars into the bank, leaving him with 200 - 100 = 100 dollars.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25: 100 Ã· 25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows. This is a classic example of a multiplication problem.

The number of children in each row is 8, and there are 7 rows. To find the total number of children, we multiply 8 by 7.

8 Ã— 7 = 56

Therefore, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can get.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. 

The fixed charge is $40, and the labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). 

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The total cost is the sum of the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. 

Total cost = $40 (fixed charge) + $78.75 (labor cost) + $60 (cost of parts)

Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To calculate the amount James was out, we need to consider the cost of the CDs after the discount and the amount he made from selling some of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the CDs after the discount. The original price of each CD is $15, and James got them for 40% off. 

Discount amount = 40% of $15 = 0.4 * $15 = $6
Cost of each CD after discount = $15 - $6 = $9

Total cost of 10 CDs after discount = 10 * $9 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount.

Money James was out = Total cost after discount - Amount made
= $90 - $200
= -$110

Since James was out of money, the amount he was out is -$110."
"To calculate the total amount Jen will earn, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, we'll multiply the quantity of yams by their price: 6 * $1.5 = $9
Next, we'll multiply the quantity of sweet potatoes by their price: 10 * $2 = $20
Then, we'll multiply the quantity of carrots by their price: 4 * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the results together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The total amount Jen will earn is $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance James swims at half the speed (1 mile per hour).
Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Distance = 8 miles

Step 5: Calculate the time James spends swimming 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 6: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to multiply the number of loaves Sam had last Friday by 7 and then subtract 40.

Let's start by multiplying 70 (the number of loaves Sam had) by 7:

70 * 7 = 490

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:

490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find the remaining stickers, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Next, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the final total, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

**Answer: 13**"
"To calculate the total commission, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the commission for the New York Times. The commission rate is 10% and the cost of each copy is $5. So, the commission per copy is 10% of $5, which is 0.1 * 5 = $0.50. Since there are 6 copies, the total commission for the New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, we calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal. The commission rate is 8% and the cost of each copy is $15. So, the commission per copy is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 * 15 = $1.20. Since there are 10 copies, the total commission for the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Now, we add the commissions for both newspapers to find the total commission: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Deanna's age as D, and Marcus's age as M.

We are given that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can write the equation: M = (1/2)L.

We are also given that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can write another equation: M = D - 5.

We know Deanna's age is 26, so we can substitute D = 26 into the second equation: M = 26 - 5, which simplifies to M = 21.

Now we can substitute M = 21 into the first equation: 21 = (1/2)L.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 2 * 21 = L, which simplifies to L = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D, respectively.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45, so we can write the equation:

B + A + D = 45

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so we can write the equation:

B = A + 20

Additionally, we know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can write the equation:

B = D + 10

Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:

1. B + A + D = 45
2. B = A + 20
3. B = D + 10

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate B:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D = 25

Now, substitute equation (3) into the above equation:

2A + (D + 10) = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2A + D = 15

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1. 2A + D = 15
2. B = D + 10

We can solve for D in terms of A using equation (2):

D = B - 10

Substitute this expression for D into equation (1):

2A + (B - 10) = 15

Substitute B = A + 20 into the above equation:

2A + (A + 20 - 10) = 15

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 15

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5/3

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the value of B:

B = A + 20
= 5/3 + 20
= 65/3

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of D:

D = B - 10
= 65/3 - 10
= 65/3 - 30/3
= 35/3

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the relationship between the physical dimensions and the page count. Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and each paper is 1 inch thick, we can calculate the number of pages as follows:

The book's thickness is comprised of 1.5 inches, and each paper is 1 inch thick. Therefore, the number of pages is equal to the book's thickness divided by the thickness of a single paper.

Number of pages = Book's thickness / Paper's thickness
= 1.5 inches / 1 inch
= 1.5

Since the book is 1.5 pages thick, and each page is 2 pages long (one on each side), we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Number of pages per inch
= 1.5 * 2
= 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled, we need to determine the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, we calculate the minutes from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, which is 4 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 4 hours by 60 minutes to get 240 minutes.

Next, we calculate the minutes from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 11 hours. We multiply 11 hours by 60 minutes to get 660 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes from both time periods: 240 minutes + 660 minutes = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled. 

900 minutes / 15 minutes per report = 60 reports.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the time she was asleep and awake separately.

Kim's usual sleep period is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. To find the time she went to sleep, we can calculate the time difference between her usual wake-up time and her actual wake-up time. 

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up at 2:15 a.m. The time difference is 3 hours and 45 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 3 * 60 + 45 = 225 minutes.

Now, we can find the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time difference from her usual sleep time. 

10 p.m. (in minutes) - 225 minutes = 3:15 p.m.

However, we need to consider the time she was sleepwalking. She woke up at 2:15 a.m. and was sleepwalking until 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we need to add the time she was asleep and the time she was awake. 

Time asleep: 3:15 p.m. - 10 p.m. = 6 hours 45 minutes
Converting this to minutes: 6 * 60 + 45 = 405 minutes

Time awake: 2:15 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours 45 minutes
Converting this to minutes: 7 * 60 + 45 = 465 minutes

Total time slept: 405 minutes + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 428 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups:
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the total number of occupied beds, we first need to calculate 1/5 of the hospital's capacity. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds.

Next, we need to determine the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have 14 days. 

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds by adding the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted: 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. We are told that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. To find Shawna's age, we multiply Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Next, we are told that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported and subtract it from the reported number.

20% of a number can be calculated by multiplying the number by 0.20. 

Let's denote the reported number as x. The correct number of people who attended the concert is x - 0.20x.

x - 0.20x = 0.80x

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that x - 0.80x = 48. 

0.20x = 48

To find x, divide both sides by 0.20:

x = 48 / 0.20
x = 240

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 0.80x, which is 0.80 * 240 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of balls carried by each boy. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we can write an equation:
Jason's balls = 2x
Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up the equation:
2 = 2x
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the number of balls carried by Jordan, which is twice as many as Jason's:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes on the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of corn chips each person would get if they were to be divided equally as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so the total number of corn chips they got is 2x. Since Collins got 15 more than the others, the total number of corn chips Collins got is x + 15.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins got, which is 2x + (x + 15). We are given that this total is 225. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 225

Combine like terms:

3x + 15 = 225

Subtract 15 from both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of corn chips. Since x is the number of corn chips each person would get if they were divided equally, we can multiply x by 3 to get the total number of corn chips:

Total corn chips = 3x = 3(70) = 210

The total number of corn chips is 210."
"To calculate the cost of the travel, we need to find 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

First, we find 50% of $400 by multiplying $400 by 0.5, which equals $200. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies, $400, to get the total cost of the travel.

$400 + $200 = $600

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting A, S, and X represent the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex, respectively. We are given the following system of equations:

A + S + X = 339
X = S + 5
S = 4A - 13

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. Let's start by substituting the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation:

A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339

Expand and simplify:

A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms:

9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:

S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 PokÃ©mon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To find the total number of episodes, we can divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To calculate the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the journey into three segments and use the formula: distance = speed Ã— time.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first segment is:
distance = 30 miles/hour Ã— 10 hours = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second segment is:
distance = 18 miles/hour Ã— 2 hours = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third segment is:
distance = 22 miles/hour Ã— 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 individual brownies.
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies at the office party, which is equivalent to 6 individual brownies.
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home, which is equivalent to 48 individual brownies.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 dozen to individual brownies, we multiply 1 1/2 by 12. 
1 1/2 * 12 = 18

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average time for each type of string and then multiply it by the number of racquets of that type.

Weighted average time for synthetic gut racquets: (3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet) / 3 racquets = 15 minutes
Weighted average time for polyester racquets: (5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet) / 5 racquets = 22 minutes
Weighted average time for hybrid racquets: (4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet) / 4 racquets = 18 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the weighted average time for each type of string by the number of racquets of that type and adding them together:

Total time = (3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet) + (5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet) + (4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet)
Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes
Total time = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 (since each phone after the first two is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300). 

To find the total cost of the remaining phones, we can multiply 3 by $300, which is 3 x $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones ($1200) to the cost of the remaining phones ($900) to get the total cost.

$1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"The problem presents a straightforward scenario where we need to find the total number of players in both teams. We are given that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team.

To find the total number of players, we can simply add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team. This can be calculated as follows:

13 (Carlton's team) + 7 (additional players in Zeke's team) = 20 (Zeke's team)

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 + 20 = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we determine the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = (1/4) * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find out how many she had left: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as x. We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 4 = number of states in India

Since we know that the number of states in India is 29, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 4 = 29

To solve for x, we can first subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 29 - 4
x/2 = 25

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 25 * 2
x = 50

Now that we know the number of states in the USA is 50, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding 4 to it:

Total number of states = 50 + 4
Total number of states = 54

The total number of states in both countries is 54."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. 

Tyler has saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he must work: $25 Ã· $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of cherries Richard has as 'R' and the number of cherries Jerry has as 'J'. We know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so we can write an equation:

R + 10 = 30

We also know that the total number of cherries is 60, so we can write another equation:

R + J + 30 = 60

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can isolate R in the first equation:

R = 30 - 10
R = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

20 + J + 30 = 60

Combine like terms:

50 + J = 60

Subtract 50 from both sides:

J = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables for the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A. Based on the given information, we can write the following equations:

G = 10 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday)
A = G - 4 (number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is 4 fewer than on Saturday)

We also know that the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 5 more than on Saturday, so we can write another equation:

G + 5 = 15 (number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for G by substituting the expression for A from the first equation into the second equation:

G + 5 = 15
G + 5 - 4 = 15 - 4
G + 1 = 11
G = 10

Now that we know G, we can find A:

A = G - 4
A = 10 - 4
A = 6

Now that we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days, we can calculate the total earnings:

Total earnings = (G * $6) + (A * $15)
Total earnings = (10 * $6) + (6 * $15)
Total earnings = $60 + $90
Total earnings = $150

Total earnings for Sunday = (G + 5) * $6 + (A) * $15
Total earnings for Sunday = (15) * $6 + (6) * $15
Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $90
Total earnings for Sunday = $180

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings for Saturday + Total earnings for Sunday
Total earnings for two days = $150 + $180
Total earnings for two days = $330

The final answer is: $330"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the number of ounces in a bottle.

She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we can divide the total number of hours by 8 to find the number of bottles needed: 32 Ã· 8 = 4.

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

The price of the red car = $100 - $40
= $60

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We have the following equations:

1. E = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. D = 2E + 24 (When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad)
3. B = 2E - 12 (When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother)

We can rewrite equation (2) as D - 2E = 24 and equation (3) as B - 2E = 12.

Now, we can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging equation (1) to isolate E, we get E = 19.

Substituting E = 19 into equation (3), we get B - 2(19) = 12, which simplifies to B = 38.

Substituting E = 19 into equation (2), we get D - 2(19) = 24, which simplifies to D = 46.

Now that we have the values of E, D, and B, we can find the sum of their ages: 19 + 46 + 38 = 103.

The final answer is: $\boxed{103}$"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

The total number of beads Adrianne has is 90."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

First, we'll multiply the amount caught on Thursday by 4 to find the amount caught on Friday: 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.

Next, we'll find the amount caught on Saturday by dividing the amount caught on Friday by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we'll add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

The length of the bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between each plant, we subtract this from the total length: 1332 - 18 = 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 1314 / 12 = 109.5. Since we can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is $552."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, we multiply 9 pretzels per day by 7 days in a week.

9 * 7 = 63 pretzels per week

The answer is 63."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of baskets by the number of items per basket and then multiply the result by the cost per item.

For petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias. Since each petunia costs $3.00, the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket = 10 vines. Since each vine costs $2.50, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses Artemis can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Since each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil and there are 4 sunflowers, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations. Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and there are 10 carnations. So, the total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations to find the total amount of soil used: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since Artemis and her father have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount they bought: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we can calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the number of times she needs to cook 30 shrimp: 90 / 30 = 3. Then, we multiply this by the time it takes to cook 30 shrimp, which is 10 minutes: 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cook: 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the final temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.

Let's break down the time spent on each setting:

- Low setting: 3 hours
- High setting: 4 hours
- No air conditioner: 2 hours

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is the sum of the cooling effects during the low and high settings. Since the air conditioner cools at 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high, the total cooling effect is:

(3 hours * 2 degrees/hour) + (4 hours * 3 degrees/hour) = 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours, so the warming effect is:

2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect:

18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can express Bill's age at that time as 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

We also know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is x. Since Bill saw the comet x + 75 years after his dad saw it, we can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 15.

Now, we can find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet: 30 + 15 = 45 years old.

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can find Bill's age at that time: 3 * 45 = 135 years old.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. To do this, we need to subtract 75 years from Bill's age at that time: 135 - 75 = 60 years old.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per month:

- He writes 1 check for the electric bill.
- He writes 1 check for the gas bill.
- He writes 2 checks for the church.

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total checks per month by 12:

4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To find the number of flights to France, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can express this as:

x/2 = 44

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 88

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is 88 * 3/4 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Let's denote the number of flights to France as y. We can set up the equation:

88 - 66 = y + y

Combine like terms:

22 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 11

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: 11"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined length of time, in minutes, of the howls of three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. 

We know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can calculate Chikote's howl duration as 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. 

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous' howl duration is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total duration, we add the individual howl durations together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve for the age of Wilfred, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know that the average age of the group is 5, so we can write the equation:

(H + 3 + 4 + W) / 4 = 5

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:

H + 7 + W = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age, so we can write another equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Substituting H = 10 into the first equation, we get:

10 + 7 + W = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 3

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. 

First, we add the amount collected from his neighbors ($500) to the amount collected from the online fund ($1500), which equals $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Next, we need to consider the contribution from Walter's friend, who will give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total, resulting in a new total of $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Now, we know that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the new total amount. To find this, we multiply the new total ($1800) by 3, which equals $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $5400."
"To determine the number of cookies given to the church, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

Next, we need to find half of the total number of cookies. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies by 2, which is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15.

750 / 15 = 50

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the adult slices are 2 times the size of the kid slices. Let's assume the size of a kid's slice is y. Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, the total size is:

2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y

Now, we know that the total size of the watermelon is 10y, and we want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets 4 slices, the total size of the adult slices is 4(2y) = 8y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, divide the size of the adult slices by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(8y / 10y) * 100 = 80%

So, each adult gets 80% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the time left for updating records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Inpatient rounds take 20 minutes per patient, and there are 9 patients. So, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Appointments take 30 minutes each, and there are 10 appointments. So, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Converting this to hours, we get 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total available time: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The time left for updating records is 1 hour."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to make the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete the task.

The total time required is the sum of the individual times: 20 minutes (making the batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes.

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get 3 hours.

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the target serving time to find the latest start time. Since the target serving time is 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from this time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. This can be represented by the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

7x = 64

Now, we can divide both sides by 7 to isolate x:

x = 64 / 7
x = 9.14 (approximately)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 9 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is 9."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25, and since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75. For a month, the cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. For a month, the cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $60 = $360.

To find the expected earnings, we need to know the total number of sessions in a month. Assuming a 4-week month, the total number of sessions is 10 students * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 120 sessions.

The cost per session is $25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (students' lessons) = $26.50. The total expected earnings for 120 sessions is $26.50 * 120 = $3180.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $3180.

$3180"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. This can be represented as 7x = 56.

We can now solve these equations to find the value of x.

Dividing both sides of the first equation by 4, we get:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can substitute this value into the second equation to verify:

7x = 7(16)
7x = 112

However, we know that Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up an equation to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box:

4x - 7x = 56 - 112
-3x = -56
x = 56 / 3
x = 18.67

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a chocolate bar), this solution is not valid. However, we can try to find the correct value of x by re-examining the original equations.

Let's re-evaluate the first equation:

4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's re-evaluate the second equation:

7x = 56
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Since x must be the same in both equations, we can set up a new equation to find the difference:

4x - 7x = 16 - 8
-3x = 8
x = -8/3

This solution is also not valid, as x cannot be negative.

However, we can try to find the correct value of x by re-examining the original equations. Let's re-evaluate the first equation:

4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's re-evaluate the second equation:

7x = 56
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Since x must be the same in both equations, we can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 7, which is 28. We can then set up a new equation:

28x = 28x

This equation is true for any value of x, so we can use the original equations to find the correct value of x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

We can now solve these equations to find the value of x.

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

7x = 7(16)
7x = 112

However, we know that Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up an equation to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box:

"To determine the number of female porcupines, we can calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the number of red sticks is R, the number of blue sticks is B, and the number of yellow sticks is Y.

We are given the following information:

1. The number of red sticks is 9: R = 9
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks: B = R + 5
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks: Y = B - 3

We can substitute the value of R into the second equation to find the value of B: B = 9 + 5 = 14

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of Y: Y = 14 - 3 = 11

Now that we have the values of B and Y, we can find the total number of sticks: Total = R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can use the formula: 

Distance = Speed x Time

For Matteo: Distance = 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy: Distance = 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we can find the difference by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we find the number of students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500.

Next, we calculate the number of male students over 16 years old: 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we find the number of female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Then, we calculate the number of students under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500.

We find the number of male students under 16 years old: 1500 / 2 = 750.

Finally, we determine the number of female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the number of laps each person can run.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can calculate Trey's laps as 10 + 4 = 14.

Next, we find Shaelyn's laps by dividing Trey's laps by 2, which gives us 14 / 2 = 7.

Lastly, we calculate Quinn's laps by subtracting 2 from Shaelyn's laps, resulting in 7 - 2 = 5.

Now, to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's re-evaluate the calculation for the first 5 hours:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

"To calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we can find 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each is 3 x $0.5 = $1.5.
Next, we calculate the total amount spent on pears: 4 pears at $0.75 each is 4 x $0.75 = $3.
Then, we calculate the total amount spent on kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 x $1 = $2.
Lastly, we calculate the total amount spent on apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent on other fruits: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25.

Since Jamaar has $10, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, we can't consider this as a viable option since it's a negative value.

To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we'll divide the amount he has by the cost of one plum: $10 Ã· $0.25 = 40.

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a plum, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jamaar can buy 40 plums.

Final answer: 40"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces she gave away. 

We know that Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since there are 15 packs in total, and she kept 2, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away (780) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

780 Ã· 10 = 78

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final price
P = initial price ($120)
r = annual increase rate (5% or 0.05)
n = number of years (3)

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

"To find the total time James spends reading, we can use the concept of ratios. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This gives us a ratio of 3 pages to 10 minutes. 

To find the time it takes James to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we need to consider the sequence of events.

First, we start with the initial number of guests: 100.

Next, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

Then, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. This brings the total to 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, increasing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the sum of the bananas he picked on each day.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, or 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 + 6 + 12 = 22

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To determine the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so we divide the remaining 36 questions by 2, resulting in 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions: 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x and the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, so the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120, which is the sum of the amount earned from large and small stuffed animals: 3x * y + 8y = 120.

We can also express the price of a large stuffed animal in terms of the price of a small stuffed animal: 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

Now we have two equations:

1) 3x * y + 8y = 120
2) 3x = 12

We can solve for x in the second equation: x = 12 / 3 = 4.

Substitute x = 4 into the first equation: 3 * 4 * y + 8y = 120.

Simplify the equation: 12y + 8y = 120.

Combine like terms: 20y = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: y = 6.

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to consider the daily consumption of each family member. 

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

First, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by each family member: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Next, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to account for the number of days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To calculate Suzanne's remaining earnings, we need to consider her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from cookies: 80 cookies * $1 = $80.
Next, we'll calculate her earnings from cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 = $240.

Now, we'll add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so we need to subtract the total amount she gave them: $20.

$320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs.

First, we'll subtract the number of eggs the twins found: 100 - 60 = 40.

Then, we'll subtract the number of eggs that were not found by the friends: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

There are 30 days in a month, so the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of unit rates. The unit rate is the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches. 

Let's find the unit rate for the first package: $3 Ã· 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the unit rate is the same for all packages, we can use it to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 per sandwich Ã— 8 sandwiches = $12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to find 10% of the remaining amount owed after Tom received $1000 from selling his old bedroom.

First, we subtract the amount received from the initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Next, we calculate 10% of the remaining amount: 0.10 x $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst.

Next, we find the number of red balloons remaining: 25 - 10 = 15.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released when Sally was startled: half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released.

Now, we find the number of yellow balloons remaining: 12 - 6 = 6.

We also need to consider the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, 6 blue balloons were added.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can use the concept of complementary probability. The probability that he won't have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 40% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

The probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6. To find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: $\boxed{40\%}$"

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We also know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L.

Furthermore, we are told that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = 3M.

Now, we can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the third equation to get S = 3(2L) = 6L.

Substituting the value of L from the first equation, we get S = 6(75) = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is 450."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly rate after expenses, we need to consider both her daily income and daily expenses. 

First, we calculate her daily income after expenses: $15 per day (daily income) - $3 per day (daily expenses) = $12 per day.

Next, we calculate her total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate her total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216.

Finally, we can calculate her hourly rate after expenses: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour.

The final answer is $12."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each can be calculated by multiplying 3 and 16, which equals 48 dollars. 

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each can be calculated by multiplying 3 and 6, which equals 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent is 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box and then divide by the number of apples in each pack.

Let's break it down:

Number of boxes: 2
Number of apples in each box: 40
Number of apples in each pack: 8

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80

Next, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 Ã· 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

First, we'll find the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Since it costs $11 per pound and she bought 2 pounds, we multiply 11 by 2 to get the total cost of Parmesan: 11 * 2 = $22.

Next, we'll find the cost of the Mozzarella cheese. It costs $6 per pound and she bought 3 pounds, so we multiply 6 by 3 to get the total cost of Mozzarella: 6 * 3 = $18.

Now, we'll add the total cost of Parmesan and Mozzarella to find the overall cost of the cheese: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is $10."
"To calculate the break-even point for Jim, we need to consider the present value of the lost income during his 4-year college period. Assuming an annual interest rate of 0% for simplicity, the present value of the lost income is:

$25,000 per year x 4 years = $100,000

This is the amount Jim needs to earn to compensate for the lost income during his college period.

Next, we need to calculate the present value of the loans. Assuming a 0% interest rate, the present value of the loans is:

$50,000 per year x 4 years = $200,000

Now, we can calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to break even:

$100,000 (lost income) + $200,000 (loans) = $300,000

Since Jim's income triples after college, his new income is $75,000 per year. To find the break-even point, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 4"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we must calculate the area of the comforter. 

The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. To create the comforter, we need to add 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed. This results in a fabric size of 6 + 2 = 8 feet by 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to multiply the number of people by the cost per person for each type of salad and then add the results together.

For the chicken salad, 10 people at $6.50 per person is 10 * 6.50 = 65.
For the pasta salad, 6 people at $6 per person is 6 * 6 = 36.

Adding these amounts together, we get 65 + 36 = 101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's break down the information given:

- The amount lost in the first race is $5.
- The amount won in the second race is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which is $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
- The amount lost in the third race is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To calculate the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

We can break this down into two steps:

Step 1: Multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country.
26 * 5 = 130

Step 2: Multiply the result by the population of each city.
130 * 1000 = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights in the same units. Since Xavier's height was initially given in feet and inches, we'll convert Cole's height to feet and inches for a fair comparison.

Cole's height in feet: 50 inches / 12 inches per foot = 4 feet 2 inches
Xavier's height in feet: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
(4 feet 2 inches) - (4 feet 3 inches) = -1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is -1 inch."
"To find the amount each person took, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x, the second person took as y, and the third person took as z.

We know that the total amount taken is $1920, so we can write the equation:

x + y + z = 1920

We also know that the second person took $80 more than the first, so we can write the equation:

y = x + 80

The third person took twice what the second person took, so we can write the equation:

z = 2y

Substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the third equation, we get:

z = 2(x + 80)

Now we can substitute the expressions for y and z into the first equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the values of y and z:

y = x + 80
y = 586.67 + 80
y = 666.67

z = 2y
z = 2(666.67)
z = 1333.33

The first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can start by converting the fraction of the day to hours.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Next, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days worked (3 weeks = 21 days):
9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters (4):
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first set as x, the number of balls retrieved in the second set as y, and the number of balls retrieved in the third set as z.

We know that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, so we can write the equation:
x = y + 4

We also know that he retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, so we can write the equation:
z = y/2

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
x + y + z = 19

Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:
x = y + 4
z = y/2
x + y + z = 19

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. We can substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the third equation:
(y + 4) + y + (y/2) = 19

Combine like terms:
2y + y/2 + 4 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4y + y + 8 = 38

Combine like terms:
5y + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5y = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
y = 6

Now that we know y, we can find x and z:
x = y + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
z = y/2 = 6/2 = 3

The final answer is 10."
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^n

where:
A = final value
P = initial value (the price of the car in 2007) = $20,000
r = annual depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
n = number of years = 3 (from 2007 to 2010)

A = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20,000(0.79)^3
A = 20,000(0.631441)
A = 12,688.82

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,688.82.

$12,688.82"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to calculate the total number of non-Spanish books first. 

Half of the books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% of the books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20 books.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can use the concept of subtraction. We know the total distance to New York City is 1955 kilometers, and she has already driven 325 kilometers. 

Let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance: 1955 - 325 = 1630

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To find the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can multiply the number of cups she drinks per day (8) by the number of days (30) and then divide the result by the number of cups in a gallon (16).

First, we multiply 8 cups/day by 30 days:
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we divide the total cups by 16 cups/gallon:
240 cups Ã· 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. This results in a net increase of 100 - 50 = 50 people. Adding this to the previous total, we get 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, decreasing the total by 80. Therefore, the final total is 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To calculate the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to consider the costs of each item.

The tank top costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24. Additionally, Alison had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot.

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate the increased cost, we need to find 60% of the normal cost of $120. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The total cost is the sum of the normal cost and the increased cost: $120 + $72 = $192

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, which means he needs to wash a total of 5 sets of sheets per week. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to consider the number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks, we can multiply the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday by 4.

The total number of movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks is 4 * 4 = 16.
The total number of movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of movies watched on both days: 16 + 8 = 24.

Therefore, in 4 weeks, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams). This can be calculated as follows:

Therefore, the cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can express Silvia's slices as 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices eaten is 4 * 8 = 32. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) + 2x = 32

Combine like terms:

4x + 3 = 32

Subtract 3 from both sides:

4x = 29

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 7.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the total number of slices eaten.

Becky's slices = x + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
Jake's slices = x = 7
Silvia's slices = 2x = 2 * 7 = 14

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The final answer is 31."
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method. 

Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs into their respective components.

The cost of the cast is a fixed fee of $200. 

The cost of the visit can be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate ($300) by the number of hours worked (0.5 hours, since the visit is 30 minutes). This gives us $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers can be calculated by multiplying the cost per pill ($4) by the number of pills (30). This gives us $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is a fixed fee of $6 per hour, and the doctor worked for 2 hours. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to calculate the number of emails that require a response first. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails: 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of emails: 80 - 16 = 64 emails that require a response.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we multiply this number by 5 to find the total number of emails responded to in a 5-day work week: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 x 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 x 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

The scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, we add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests: 380 Ã· 4 = 95

Therefore, the average score is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

First, we find 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas. 

Next, we calculate 80% of 40 pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"The task at hand involves calculating the total cost of postage for a pizza parlor's coupon distribution. We're given that 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons (1400) are being sent out.

To determine the total cost, we'll calculate the cost of each type of coupon and then add them together. The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, while a big coupon costs 15 cents.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the small coupons:
700 small coupons * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the big coupons:
1400 big coupons * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, we'll add the costs of both types of coupons together:
3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we'll divide by 100:
24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

However, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

A quarter of 20 trucks is equivalent to 20 * 1/4 = 20 * 0.25 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. We know that 5 trucks could not deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is:
20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To calculate the total cost of the butter, we need to determine the number of pounds Dennis needs and apply the promotion.

Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. Therefore, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy, we divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then apply the rental fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

To find the cost for the additional guests, we need to multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest.

Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the initial rental fee and the cost for the additional guests.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

"To find the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x. We know that 2x = 120.

Now, let's find out how much money Maggie spent. She spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of x. We can represent this as (1/4)x. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of x. We can represent this as (1/3)x.

The total amount of money they spent is (1/4)x + (1/3)x. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, we can rewrite the fractions as (3/12)x + (4/12)x = (7/12)x.

We know that the total amount of money they spent is $35. We can set up the equation (7/12)x = 35.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12/7, which gives us x = 60.

Now that we know the initial amount of money they had, we can find out how much money they have left. They had 2x = 2 * 60 = $120. The total amount of money they spent is (7/12)x = (7/12) * 60 = $35. To find the amount of money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had: $120 - $35 = $85.

The final answer is $85."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. Since there are three monkeys, we can calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 = 70 bananas and 14 * 7 = 98 bananas, respectively. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:

147 Ã· 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses."
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 * 5.50 = 33
Next, we'll calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 * 11 = 99
Lastly, we'll calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 * 1.50 = 30

Now, let's add the results together: 33 + 99 + 30 = 162

The final answer is: $162"
"To calculate the total waiting time for Paul, we need to break down the time between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 * 12 = 120

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 - 120 = 80

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 Ã· 10 = 8

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price.

First, we find the sale price at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers bought it for. 

Sale price = Original price * 1.20
Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

Now, we find the difference between the sale price and the original price:

Discount = Sale price - Original price
Discount = $3200 - $2666.67
Discount = $533.33

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = ($533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = 20%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 20%."
"To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to consider the rate at which each spring produces jellyfish. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour and then multiply it by 5 and by 4.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 24 hours in a day. Therefore, there are 60 * 60 * 24 = 86,400 seconds in 4 hours.

Since a spring creates 1 jellyfish every 1 second, in 86,400 seconds, it would create 86,400 jellyfish. 

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 times the number created by one spring in 4 hours, which is 5 * 86,400 = 432,000 jellyfish.

The final answer is 432,000."
"To solve this problem, we can represent Frankie's score as 'F' and Binkie's score as 'B'. We are given that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This can be written as an equation:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90. We can substitute this value into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To calculate the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the round trip. 

The total distance is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, we multiply the number of bananas by the cost per banana:

40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Each bunch contains 4 bananas and costs $3.00, so we multiply the number of bunches by the cost per bunch:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much money Jenny saved:

$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the amount of fence Sam gets as x and the amount Harry gets as x + 60.

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find out how much is left over for Sam by subtracting the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can use the concept of ratios. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, which gives us a ratio of 8 inches to 4 years. To find the growth in 13 years, we can set up a proportion:

8 inches / 4 years = x inches / 13 years

We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying:

8 * 13 = 4x
104 = 4x
x = 104 / 4
x = 26

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is 26."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck operate.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. To find the net change in the number of bales per hour, we subtract the number of bales collected from the number of bales produced: 5 - 3 = 2.

Since they work for 6 hours, we multiply the net change per hour by the number of hours: 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

**The final answer is 12.**"
"To find the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, we calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: an = ar^(n-1), where a is the initial term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, the initial term (a) is 72 feet (3 stories), and the common ratio (r) is 2/3. We want to find the second term (n=2).

an = ar^(n-1)
a2 = 72 * (2/3)^(2-1)
a2 = 72 * (2/3)^1
a2 = 72 * 2/3
a2 = 48

Therefore, the ball will go 48 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to 72 inches, resulting in 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from 74 inches, yielding 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to 69 inches, giving us 72 inches.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 Ã· 10 = 200

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that a group of Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, and this is half of what was left after a Tyrannosaurus rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Since the Allosaurus ate half of what was left, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Let's call the original amount ""y"". Since the T-Rex ate half of y, we can set up the equation: y/2 = 540.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2: y = 1080.

Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

Final answer: 1080"
"To calculate the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total. Ellen shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. She then takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas. Her brother takes 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas (2) divided by the total number of sodas (2 + 9 = 11).

The probability is 2/11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.18\%}$"
"To calculate the distance between the two trains, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time.

Given that one train is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at half that distance per hour (30 miles per hour), we can calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

For the first train: Distance = 60 miles/hour Ã— 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train: Distance = 30 miles/hour Ã— 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to work. March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. 

20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

Billy is available to work for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. There are 12 buses, and each bus carries 35 people. To find the total number of people in the buses, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people per bus:

12 * 35 = 420

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. There are 20 cars, and each car carries 3 people. To find the total number of people in the cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of people per car:

20 * 3 = 60

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

420 + 60 = 480

The final answer is: 480"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the information given as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. J = M + 10 (Jeff is 10 years older than Martha)
2. M = K - 4 (Martha is 4 years younger than Mike)

We are also given that Mike is 24 years old, so K = 24.

Substituting K = 24 into the second equation, we get:
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now, substituting M = 20 into the first equation, we get:
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.
For the second biggest slide, the time is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the distance run by Ahito, we need to first determine the distance run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the items she purchased after the returns.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. The new balance after the return is:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance on her credit card is the sum of the remaining balance after the return and the total cost of the new purchases:

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that a third of the large jellyfish change color. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation:

(x/5) / 3 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get:

x/5 = 18

Next, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get:

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2. 

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Next, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. To find Caroline's age, we multiply Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her desired retirement income and the amount she needs to save for that income.

Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $40,000. She also wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years.

First, let's calculate her desired annual retirement income. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her desired annual retirement income is $40,000.

Since she wants to save for 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement.

Total amount needed for retirement = Desired annual retirement income * Number of years
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Since Lauren saves 20% of her income, we need to calculate her current annual income. We know that 20% of her income is $20,000.

Current annual income = Total amount saved / Savings rate
= $20,000 / 0.20
= $100,000

Now, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save for retirement.

Number of years = Total amount needed for retirement / Current annual income
= $800,000 / $100,000
= 8 years

Since Lauren has already worked for some years, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years she needs to work.

Number of years she needs to work = Total number of years - Number of years she has already worked
= 8 - 0 (assuming she has not worked any years yet)
= 8 years

However, we are asked to find out how many more years she needs to work. Since she has not worked any years yet, she needs to work for the calculated number of years.

Final Answer: 8"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must consider the total length of the ribbon and the number of divisions it will undergo. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This yields 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This results in 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the soil is $26. Adding these two amounts together gives us $19 + $26 = $45.

However, we need to account for the $7 discount. To do this, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we need to find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

We have 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, contributing a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches. Additionally, we have 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, contributing a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

With 6 women in total, we can find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:

18 / 6 = 3

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine the required daily mileage, we can use the following formula:

Total Distance / Number of Days = Required Daily Mileage

In this case, the total distance is 9,300 miles, and the number of days is 30. 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find the additional miles she needs to hike per day to meet the total distance goal.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To calculate the total amount the store will receive, we need to multiply the number of each color of balls by their respective costs and add them together.

The cost of red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.
The cost of blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.
The cost of green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add these amounts together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we need to calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples, which is 1/4 * 12 kg = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of the total apples, which is 1/3 * 12 kg = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially was 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques is 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Increase in temperature: 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature
= 2 + 3
= 5 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we need to consider the sequence of events.

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then added $11 to this amount, resulting in a total of $21 + $11 = $32. After that, he spent $5 on a comic book, reducing his total to $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, leaving him with $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

$8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to determine the total amount spent on the books. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 Ã· 2 = $5

The cost of each book is $5."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled this year, we need to find 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 can be calculated as 0.20 x 50 = 10.

The total number of students this year is the original number plus the increase, which is 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the unknown time as x. We know that 255 blinks occur in 5 minutes, so we can write the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

255x = 459 * 5

255x = 2295

Now, we can divide both sides by 255 to isolate x:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9.00

So, it will take the light approximately 9.00 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fish, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish.

The initial number of male fish is 4 (guppies) + 3 (goldfish) = 7.
The initial number of female fish is 7 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 12.

Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. 
The total number of male fish becomes 7 + 2 + 2 = 11.
The total number of female fish becomes 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of female and male fish:
16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia's time to mow the lawn is 4 hours. Since Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, Megan's time to walk the dog is 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior's time to do laundry is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's time, so Dior's time is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To calculate the total distance driven in a month, we need to consider the round trip distance. The distance to his parents is calculated as:

Time = 2 hours
Speed = 70 mph

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, the total distance is:
Total Distance = 2 * 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To find the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to divide the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days by 2.

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can multiply 10 by 7 to find the total distance she will walk in 7 days: 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Now, we divide the total distance by 2 to find the distance Brian will walk: 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers. Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as x.

The total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour is 2 x 6 x 10 = 120.
The total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour is 2 x 4 x 10 = 80.
The total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 10x.

Since the total number of toys needed is 220, we can set up the equation:

120 + 80 + 10x = 220

Combine like terms:

200 + 10x = 220

Subtract 200 from both sides:

10x = 20

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 2

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 + 30 + 60 = 105

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers initially.

Now, we know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

Therefore, the correct answer is 46."
"To calculate the total number of M&M's, we can multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.

Next, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags.

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance by his daily distance.

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we can use the given information to establish a proportional relationship between the speeds of the cars.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C. We know that:

A = 120 Miles per hour

We also know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we can write:

B = 5A
B = 5 * 120
B = 600 Miles per hour

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so we can write:

C = 1.25B
C = 1.25 * 600
C = 750 Miles per hour

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Vince's current age as ""x"". Since Liam's age is twice Vince's age two years ago, we can write the equation:

Liam's current age = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

We know Liam is 16 now, so we can substitute 16 for Liam's current age:

16 = 2 * (x - 2)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

8 = x - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate x:

x = 10

Therefore, Vince's current age is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M, and C + S = 30. We also know that C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the equation C = S + 12 as S = C - 12.

Now, substitute S = C - 12 into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us C + (C - 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2C - 12 = 30.

Add 12 to both sides: 2C = 42.

Divide both sides by 2: C = 21.

Now that we know C = 21, we can find S by substituting C into the equation S = C - 12, which gives us S = 21 - 12 = 9.

Since A = M, we know that A = 13.

The difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately.

First, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons and boxes to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the weight in ounces by 16:

Weight of crayons in pounds = Weight of crayons in ounces / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Since the weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we find 80% of 80 feet, which represents the length of the tree that can be used to make logs. This is calculated as 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 feet by 4 feet per log to find the number of logs: 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

Next, we determine the number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5 planks per log: 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank: 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to first determine each of their individual salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much, so his salary is 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother's salary is twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. To find the combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Then, we multiply this by 2 to find the mother's salary: 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x'. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach, the time it takes to walk on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We also know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 3 miles:

Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = Total time
120/x + 30/x = 3

Combine like terms:

(120 + 30) / x = 3

150 / x = 3

Multiply both sides by x:

150 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

50 = x

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = 30/x = 30/50 = 0.6 minutes

Now we can find the total time:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 0.6
Total time = 40.6 minutes

The final answer is: 40.6"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate how much she has already saved.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we can multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks to find the total amount she has saved:
$4 x 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 Ã· $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can use the principle of addition. We have three groups of trees with 7 blue birds each, two groups with 4 blue birds each, and one group with 3 blue birds.

We can start by multiplying the number of trees in each group by the number of blue birds in that group. 

For the first group, 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: 3 x 7 = 21
For the second group, 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: 2 x 4 = 8
For the third group, 1 tree with 3 blue birds: 1 x 3 = 3

Now, we add the total number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's represent the number of marbles Bob has initially as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce.

We can set up the equation:

(4/5)(33) + (1/5)x = 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 5:

4(33) + x = 200

Expanding the left side:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to consider the daily additions of cows and chickens.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

Each day, 20 cows are added, and 10 chickens are added. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we can calculate the total number of cows and chickens added as follows:

Total cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number of cows and chickens added:

Total cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total cows and total chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount on 4 packs of bagels, we can follow these steps:

First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00, so the total cost is:

4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Next, we calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of the total cost:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Russell pays:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel:

$36.00 Ã· 9 = $4.00

Therefore, each single bagel costs $4.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's say x is the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, and y is the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes: x = 23 - 5
x = 18

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes: y = (6 - 3) - 1
y = 2

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, so we can set up a proportion to relate x and y:
x / 2 = 3 / y
Substituting the value of y, we get:
18 / 2 = 3 / 2
18 * 2 = 3 * 2
36 = 6

Now, we can use the value of x to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate:
x = 18
Since x represents the number of scoops, we need to find the corresponding number of potatoes. We know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, so we can multiply 18 scoops by 3 to find the number of potatoes:
18 * 3 = 54

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break it down into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs in this period, we multiply 3 eggs by 30 days:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs in this period, we multiply 5 eggs by 30 days:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the overall total:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can start by identifying the total number of non-blue jellybeans. We know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, which means there are 2 x 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

The total number of non-blue jellybeans is the sum of the green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since the total number of jellybeans is 60, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we can use the fundamental principle of multiplication. 

We have 5 trees, each producing 6 lemons per year. To find the total lemons collected in a decade, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree and then by the number of years in a decade.

First, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree: 5 * 6 = 30 lemons per year.

Next, we multiply the result by the number of years in a decade: 30 * 10 = 300 lemons.

Therefore, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the number of men is 5 parts, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 84

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 16.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16.8 to 16 (as you can't have 0.8 of a person). 

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 16 = 80. 

The number of women is 9x = 9 * 16 = 144, but we know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation:

9x + 5x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now we know that the number of women is 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold as 'x' and the number of bouquets sold as 'y'. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

2x + 8y = 26 (total earnings from sunflowers)
8y = 56 (total earnings from bouquets)

We can solve the second equation for y:
y = 56 / 8
y = 7

Now that we know y, we can substitute this value into the first equation:
2x + 8(7) = 26
2x + 56 = 26
2x = -30
x = -15

However, the number of sunflowers cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can re-evaluate the second equation:
8y = 56
y = 7

Now, let's re-examine the first equation:
2x + 8(7) = 26
2x + 56 = 26
2x = -30
x = -15

This solution is still not valid. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We can re-examine the first equation:
2x + 8y = 26
2x + 8(7) = 26
2x + 56 = 26
2x = -30
x = -15

However, we can also re-examine the second equation:
8y = 56
y = 7

Now, let's re-evaluate the first equation:

"To calculate the amount of money Adam loses, we need to determine the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, the total cost is:

$5 * 100 = $500

Next, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 100 rocks is:

0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount he earns is:

60 rocks * $7/rock = $420

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:

Loss = Total cost - Total earnings
= $500 - $420
= $80

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's calculate the time required for each type of scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 36 eggs. 

There are 4 children. 

Using the division algorithm, we can find the quotient by dividing 36 by 4. 

36 Ã· 4 = 9 

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total monthly expenditure on food for Jen's fish, we need to consider the number of days in May and the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily cost to find the total monthly expenditure for one fish:

31 days * $1/day = $31

To find the total monthly expenditure for all three fish, we can multiply the result by 3:

$31 * 3 = $93

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we need to consider the sequence of events.

First, we subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses: 30 - 24 = 6.

Next, we add the number of roses she purchased: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial distance and the additional distance, which is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial time and the additional time, which is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"When two independent events occur, the probability of both events happening is found by multiplying the probabilities of each event. In this case, we have two independent events: the first ticket winning and the second ticket winning.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and Y, respectively.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be represented by the equation:

J = C + 5

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This can be represented by the equation:

C = 2Y

Additionally, we know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is 60. This can be represented by the equation:

C + J + Y = 60

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for Y:

(2Y) + (2Y + 5) + Y = 60

Combine like terms:

5Y + 5 = 60

Subtract 5 from both sides:

5Y = 55

Divide both sides by 5:

Y = 11

Now that we know Y, we can find C by substituting Y into the second equation:

C = 2(11)
C = 22

Now that we know C, we can find J by substituting C into the first equation:

J = 22 + 5
J = 27

Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 60. Dividing 60 seashells equally among the three people, we get:

60 Ã· 3 = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:
60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is $40, and the cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is $80. The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is $40. To find the total selling price of 6 devices, we multiply the selling price by the total number of devices: 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can find Ned's height by subtracting 2 from Isabel's height: 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. To find Carl's height, we add 1 to Ned's height: 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of Carl's cane, which is half as long as Carl's height. To do this, we divide Carl's height by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

Therefore, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

However, this represents 20% of the total energy demand. To find 100% of the demand, we need to multiply this number by 5 (since 20% * 5 = 100%).

460 bottles * 5 = 2300 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

2300 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 1900 bottles

Since the result is negative, it means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. To find the additional number of bottles they need to produce, we can take the absolute value of the result.

| - 1900 | = 1900 bottles

The final answer is 1900."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the event of a baby wearing a bow as B and the event of a baby wearing purple as P. We know that 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so the number of purple bow wearers is 1/3 of the purple wearers. 

We can express this as: P(B âˆ© P) = 1/3 * P(P)

We also know that the total number of bow wearers is 4, which is the sum of the purple bow wearers and the blue bow wearers. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, the number of blue bow wearers is 2/3 of the total purple wearers. 

Let's denote the number of purple wearers as x. Then, the number of blue wearers is 2x/3. The total number of bow wearers is the sum of the purple bow wearers and the blue bow wearers, which is x + 2x/3 = 5x/3.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
P(B) = P(B âˆ© P) + P(B âˆ© (P'))
= 1/3 * P(P) + 2/3 * P(P')
We know that P(B) = 4/8 = 1/2, and P(P') = 1 - P(P) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

Substituting these values, we get:
1/2 = 1/3 * 3/4 + 2/3 * 1/4
1/2 = 1/4 + 1/6
1/2 = (3 + 1) / 12
1/2 = 4/12
1/2 = 1/3

Now, we can solve for P(P) by multiplying both sides by 3:
3/2 = 4
P(P) = 3/4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
P(B âˆ© P) / P(B) = (1/3 * P(P)) / P(B) = (1/3 * 3/4) / (1/2) = 1/4 / 1/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%

The final answer is 50%."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, subtract the total reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received on Thursday and Friday:
2136 - 1907 = 229

Now, subtract the result from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 229 = 4939

Therefore, the IRS received 4939 reports on Wednesday."
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Abraham initially has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, he sold 40 square meters of land for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 is 20, he sold 20 square meters of land for $30.

Now, we need to find the remaining land. Abraham initially had 80 square meters, and he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

Abraham sold the remaining 20 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount he earned from this sale, we multiply the remaining land by the price per square meter: 20 * 3 = $60.

Abraham initially earned $50 from the first sale and $30 from the second sale. He then earned an additional $60 from the last sale. In total, he earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent Geb's age as 'x'. Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we can write the equation:

x = (1/2) * 26 - 10

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

x = 13 - 10
x = 3

Therefore, Geb's age is 3."
"To calculate the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by the number of days.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of face masks used per day: 2 * 3 = 6 face masks.

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2: 6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks.

Therefore, the correct answer is 12 face masks."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found and subtract it from the total number of eggs hidden.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs found. Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is 9."
"To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the pattern of fruit production in the avocado tree. 

Let's denote the initial amount of fruits as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. 

In the first year, the tree produces 50 fruits. This can be represented as a = 50.

In the second year, the tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which can be represented as ar = 3a = 150. This implies that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the third year, the tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which can be represented as ar^2 = 7a = 350. This confirms that the common ratio 'r' is indeed 3.

In the fourth year, the tree produces 7 times the amount in the second year, which can be represented as ar^3 = 7ar = 7 * 150 = 1050. This also confirms that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the fifth year, the tree produces 7 times the amount in the third year, which can be represented as ar^4 = 7ar^2 = 7 * 350 = 2450. This confirms that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the sixth year, the tree produces 7 times the amount in the fourth year, which can be represented as ar^5 = 7ar^3 = 7 * 1050 = 7350. This confirms that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the seventh year, the tree produces 7 times the amount in the fifth year, which can be represented as ar^6 = 7ar^4 = 7 * 2450 = 17150. This confirms that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the eighth year, the tree produces 10 times the amount in the sixth year minus 200, which can be represented as ar^7 - 200 = 10ar^5 - 200 = 10 * 7350 - 200 = 17100. This confirms that the common ratio 'r' is 3.

In the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.

In the tenth year, the tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which can be represented as 20a = 20 * 50 = 1000.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 + ar^6 + ar^7 = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To find the total amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100 and add it to the $100 Jack already had.

1/5 of $100 can be calculated by dividing $100 by 5, which equals $20. 

Now, we add $20 to $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Y represent the length of the yellow rope, B represent the length of the blue rope, and R represent the length of the red rope.

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: Y + B + R = 37

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. Let's substitute the expression for B into the equation for R:

R = 4B
R = 4(Y - 7)

Now, substitute the expression for R into the equation for the combined length:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Rissa was given initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, we can calculate Rissa's initial amount as 3 times Ronnie's amount.

Rissa's initial amount = 3 * Ronnie's amount
Rissa's initial amount = 3 * $5
Rissa's initial amount = $15

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister.

Let's denote the amount Ronnie gave to her sister as x. Since Rissa gave 1/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

(1/5) * Rissa's initial amount = x
(1/5) * $15 = x
x = $3

Now, we know that Rissa gave $3 to her sister. To find out how much money Rissa has left, we subtract the amount she gave from her initial amount:

Rissa's remaining amount = Rissa's initial amount - x
Rissa's remaining amount = $15 - $3
Rissa's remaining amount = $12

Since Ronnie didn't give any money to her sister, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is $5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by recognizing that the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can represent the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. The amount of yellow paint is half the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color (red, white, and purple), the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom: 20 feet (length) x 12 feet (width) = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"The problem at hand involves a geometric sequence where the number of clouds Alice counts each day is twice the number of clouds from the previous day. This is a classic example of a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.

To find the total number of clouds counted across all five days, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the series
- a is the first term (3 clouds on Monday)
- r is the common ratio (2)
- n is the number of terms (5 days)

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we need to first find the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20/100 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod:

Cost of one pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12
= 8.33

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since $1000 / $20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

He then loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the information into manageable parts.

Let's start with the first half. Team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

0.20 * (2.25 - 0.20x) = 0.45

Simplifying the equation:

0.20 * 2.25 - 0.20 * 0.20x = 0.45

0.45 - 0.04x = 0.45

Subtracting 0.45 from both sides:

-0.04x = 0

Dividing both sides by -0.04:

x = 5

So, the teacher will have 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the number of students on varsity and subtract that from the total number of students.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 Ã· 3 = 4. 

The number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 Ã· 4 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we know Mike bought 5 face masks. We are told that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike is 3 times 5, which equals 15. 

To find the total number of face masks Johnny bought, we add 2 to 15, resulting in 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to first calculate the total number of teeth fixed. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than the number drilled, so the total number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

Now, we add the number of teeth drilled and capped to find the total number of teeth fixed: 4 + 11 = 15.

Next, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, which is 30. 

15 / 30 = 0.5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased. 

First, we'll convert the fraction 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 2 Ã· 5 = 0.4. 

Now, we'll multiply the decimal by the total gallons: 0.4 * 4000 = 1600 gallons.

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be: 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's represent Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can rewrite this equation as:

3C + 75 = W

Now we have a system of two equations:

W = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000. 

We know that 100 books cost $500. To find the number of sets Bob can buy, we'll divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 Ã· $500 = 54 sets

Since Bob has 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get.

54 sets Ã· 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Finally, we'll multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books each school can get.

18 sets per school Ã— 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he put 6 apples in his pocket and threw 1 apple back into the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags. Then, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each friend consumes. Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

With 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 

60 Ã· 12 = 5 (cheese pizzas)
60 Ã· 8 = 7.5 (pepperoni pizzas)

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles for each day and add them together.

Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Jim's age as 'x'. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age
28 = 2x

To find Jim's age, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old."
"The problem at hand involves determining the total number of apple slices consumed by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. To calculate this, we must consider the number of slices each individual consumed.

Doxa initially consumed 1 slice of the apple. Her sister then consumed 1 more slice than Doxa, which equates to 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Lastly, her brother consumed 1 more slice than her sister, resulting in 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices consumed, we must add the slices each individual ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 15 = 63.

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to consider two components: the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut.

The cost of the color is a fixed amount of $40. 

The cost of the haircut is calculated by multiplying the difference in length of her hair by the cost per inch. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost per inch is $30. Therefore, the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

First, we calculate the total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 7.5 hours a day, we multiply the number of hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week and then by the number of weeks.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings from her hourly rate. We multiply the total hours worked by her hourly rate of $1.5.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply and add the amounts he earned from each activity.

First, let's calculate the total amount he earned from emptying the dishwasher: 6 x $0.50 = $3.00

Next, we add the amount he earned from doing his laundry: $3.00

Then, we calculate the total amount he earned from taking the trash out: 2 x $0.75 = $1.50

Finally, we add the amount he earned from cleaning his room: $1.50

Now, let's add all the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Therefore, Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period.

"The problem at hand involves calculating the total amount of blood in a group of sharks. We are given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find the amount of blood a single shark has, we can multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10.

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks have a total of 1200 gallons of blood."
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we have 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total is now 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is now 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it's 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 Ã— 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 Ã— 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 Ã— $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information into steps.

First, we know that Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total number of White Oak trees 20 + 10 = 30.

Next, we need to find the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 10 = 30
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 30 + 90 = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we'll break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, resulting in 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining.

On the third day, 5 gallons were drunk, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 Ã· 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve the equation 4x + 8 = 40, we can start by subtracting 8 from both sides:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. To add fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 44. We can rewrite 5/11 as 20/22, and then 20/22 * 2 = 40/22.

Now, we can add 40/22 and 22/22. 
40/22 + 22/22 = 62/22.

To simplify, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. 
62/2 = 31 and 22/2 = 11.

So, 31 fish have red and blue stripes.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

Combining the colors from the palettes and makeup sets, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one palette, which contained 4 colors. This reduces the total number of colors to 26 - 4 = 22.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the height of the first floor as follows:

Height of the first floor = 7 * 60 = 420 inches

Next, we find the height of the second floor. Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we can calculate the height of the second floor as follows:

Height of the second floor = 3 * 60 = 180 inches

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor:

Height of the roof = Height of the first floor - Height of the second floor
= 420 - 180
= 240 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find the number of miles the last dog needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

We know that the first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs as 'x'. The total number of miles all the dogs need is 1 + 4 + 3 + x.

Since there are 4 dogs, we divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. The average is given as 3 miles per day. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 + 4 + 3 + x) / 4 = 3

To solve for 'x', we first simplify the left side of the equation:

(8 + x) / 4 = 3

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

8 + x = 12

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate 'x':

x = 4

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles per day."
"To calculate the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we find 40% of the value of John's house, which is $250,000. This can be calculated as 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000.

Next, we determine the amount used to pay off debts, which is 60% of the loan amount. This can be calculated as 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the amount leftover. This can be calculated as $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram. 

First, we add the weights of the three tunas: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram: 128 * 0.50 = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
To find the selling price, we can multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

First, we can convert the fraction 11/8 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 11 Ã· 8 = 1.375
Now, we can multiply the cost price by this decimal: 
Selling price = 72 * 1.375
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

First, we calculate the amount of water removed at the low setting. Since the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day and Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

Next, we calculate the amount of water removed at the medium setting. The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

Then, we calculate the amount of water removed at the high setting. The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Finally, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can use the concept of subtraction. We know that there were 10 packs of balloons, each containing 30 balloons. To find the total number of balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack.

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Since 12 balloons were left, we can subtract this from the total to find the number of balloons thrown.

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first find the amount of each medicine in one dose.

The first medicine requires 14 mL per dose. 
The second medicine requires 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL.

In one dose, the total amount of medicine is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has 2 classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 1/8 * 120 = 15
John's school capacity = 2 * 15 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools = 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial amount borrowed. The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we can calculate the total amount paid in those months as:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. To find this amount, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months:

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $281."
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to consider the total number of diapers that require changes and the division of labor between Jordan and his wife.

Since there are 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

As Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can divide the total number of diaper changes by 2 to find out how many Jordan changes. 

10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine the volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length * width * height. In this case, V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the packing efficiency: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of red jelly beans, which is 30%. To find the number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans was 765 less than the true number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first stop. We know that 40 people entered the bus. 

Next, we need to find 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first stop. This is calculated as (3/4) * 40 = 30.

Now, we add the initial number of people on the bus (20) to the number of people who entered at the first stop (40) and the number of people who entered at the second stop (30). This gives us a total of 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. This means the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

To find the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus (180) from the bus's capacity (200). This gives us 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 years and the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 30 students in total (10 students per grade * 3 grades). Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

30 students Ã· 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective costs and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated as 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated as 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of meatballs to pounds of meat. We know that he gets 16 meatballs per pound of meat, and he wants to make 80 meatballs. Let's use the ratio of meatballs to pounds to find the amount of seasoning needed.

Let x be the number of pounds of meat Aiden needs. We can set up the proportion:

16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80

Dividing both sides by 16 gives us:

x = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find the amount of seasoning needed by multiplying the number of pounds by 2 tablespoons per pound:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total fabric needed, we can multiply the number of windows by the width of each window and then multiply the result by 2.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

First, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window:
5 * 35 = 175

Next, we multiply the result by 2:
175 * 2 = 350

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we can break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'x' and the number of brownies as 'y'. We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write the equation:

y = 3x - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets two treats. Since there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10. This can be represented by the equation:

x + y = 10

Now we have a system of linear equations:

y = 3x - 2
x + y = 10

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we need to first find the discount for getting both services. The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To calculate the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we calculate the price after the 80% increase in December:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount is:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25%, which is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount earned from these lessons is:

2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the total amount earned from the standard lessons and the total amount earned from the lessons with veterans to find the overall total:

$320 + $120 = $440

Therefore, Charlie will make a total of $440 for the day."
"To calculate the mean, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total score by 9:
630 Ã· 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine the amount she had left after giving some away. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it as follows:

Let's denote the original amount as x. We know that 1/4 of x is equal to 5. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 5 * 4
x = 20

Now that we know the original amount, we can find the amount Eve gave away by subtracting the amount left from the original amount:

Amount given away = Original amount - Amount left
= 20 - 5
= 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate 2/5 of 60, which is the number of apples Walter ate. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Next, we find the remaining number of apples after Walter ate 24 apples:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Then, we calculate 25% of the remaining apples, which Walter gave to his sister:
25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

Now, we find the remaining number of apples after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Walter received by selling the remaining 27 apples at $3 each:
27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the total number of novels written this year as 'x'. Since 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year, we can write the equation:

3/4 * x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * 4/3

x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To calculate the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to first determine the total number of hours he traveled. Since he is traveling for 3 days, we can convert the days to hours by multiplying 3 by 24, which equals 72 hours.

Next, we multiply the average speed of 50 km/hr by the total number of hours traveled to find the distance covered: 50 km/hr x 72 hours = 3600 km.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total distance covered by dividing the distance covered by the total distance and multiplying by 100: (3600 / 6000) x 100 = 60%.

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can start by calculating the total number of grapes used by the family. 

First, we know that the brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, who ate 6 grapes. So, the brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Next, we add the grapes eaten by Madeline and her brother: 6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) = 36 grapes.

We are also given that the mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. To find the total grapes used by the mother, we multiply the number of pies by the number of grapes per pie: 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by the family: 36 (Madeline and brother) + 48 (mother) = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

The number of sick teachers is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. 

13 + 9 = 22

There were 22 teachers at school that day."
"To calculate the total yearly cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to break down the costs and multiply them by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of pasta in a year is:
$1.00 * 52 = $52.00

The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. The total cost of cheese per week is:
$3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

Now, we add the cost of pasta and cheese to get the total weekly cost:
$52.00 + $9.00 = $61.00

To find the total yearly cost, we multiply the total weekly cost by 52:
$61.00 * 52 = $3,132.00

The final answer is: $3,132."
"To calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we first need to determine the total hours spent cleaning. 

The custodian cleans 80 classrooms, with each classroom taking 15 minutes to clean. We can convert the time per classroom to hours by dividing by 60: 
15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours/classroom

Now, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom to find the total hours spent cleaning: 
80 classrooms * 0.25 hours/classroom = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, so their combined capacity is 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 / 55 = 2

However, since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can see that 2 bookcases can hold 40 books (2 x 20), and we still have 70 books left. We can fit 70 books in 3 bookcases (3 x 20 = 60), but we still have 10 books left. Therefore, we need 3 bookcases to hold all of Elly's books.

The final answer is 3."
"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price.

First, we'll find the total cost. Since Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, we can multiply 5 by $2.40 to get the total cost.

Total cost = 5 * $2.40
Total cost = $12

Next, we'll find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can multiply 5 by 12 to get the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 5 * 12
Total eggs = 60

Now, we'll find the total selling price. Rose will sell each egg for $1, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by $1 to get the total selling price.

Total selling price = 60 * $1
Total selling price = $60

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $60 - $12
Profit = $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the other half are not red. So, 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 hats that are not red.

Next, we find the number of blue hats. 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the number of hats that are not red to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The discounted price of the bag is $15.00. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 Ã· 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the minimum number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we can set up an equation:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

To find 70% of 110 questions, we multiply 110 by 0.7:

0.7 * 110 = 77

Since Audrey already got 60% of the first test correct, we need to find the number of questions she got right on the first test:

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass:

77 (total correct) - 42 (correct on first test) = 35 questions correct needed on the second test

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of strawberry cubes be represented by a variable, say 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

The formula for this calculation is: Total points = Number of games per year * Number of years * Points per game

Let's break it down:

Number of games per year = 40
Number of years = 4
Points per game = 21

Total points = 40 * 4 * 21

To multiply these numbers, we can first multiply 40 and 4:
40 * 4 = 160

Then, we multiply 160 by 21:
160 * 21 = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, Brendan starts with 10 marbles. He then loses half of them, which means he is left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. After that, he finds 3 more marbles, increasing his total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Finally, he discards a non-marble, which doesn't affect the count of marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

- Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn a bonus.
- For every 25 telephone calls, he gets 1 potential customer.
- For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold.

We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of telephone calls and potential customers. Let x be the number of telephone calls needed to get 15 potential customers.

The proportion is: 25 calls / 1 customer = x calls / 15 customers

We can cross-multiply and solve for x:

25 * 15 = x
375 = x

Now, we need to find the number of customers that will be generated from these 375 potential customers. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we can set up another proportion:

2 customers / 1 car = 375 potential customers / y cars

We can cross-multiply and solve for y:

2y = 375
y = 375 / 2
y = 187.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round down to 187 customers.

Now, we need to find the number of telephone calls needed to get 187 potential customers. We can set up another proportion:

25 calls / 1 customer = x calls / 187 customers

We can cross-multiply and solve for x:

25 * 187 = x
4625 = x

Therefore, Jason needs to make 4625 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 4625"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, we can multiply the number of people by the number of flashlights per person: 4 people * 2 flashlights/person = 8 flashlights.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. The house has 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. To find the number of rooms with small candles, we divide the total number of rooms by 2: 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of small candles: 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The answer is: 44"
"To determine the number of chips each person will receive, we must divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. In this case, we have 110 chips and 5 family members.

The division can be represented as:

110 Ã· 5 = ?

To solve this, we can use the concept of equal sharing. We can think of the chips as being divided into 5 equal groups, with each group representing one family member.

Since 110 is not exactly divisible by 5, we can find the quotient and remainder. 

110 Ã· 5 = 22 with a remainder of 0.

This means that we can divide the 110 chips into 22 equal groups of 5 chips each, with no chips left over. Therefore, each person will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the problem into segments and apply the concept of varying rates.

Let's denote the time it takes to get to the first side as 'x'. Since the second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, their combined time is 2x. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so their combined time is 0.5x.

We know that once the fifth side is completed, all 6 sides are solved. Therefore, the total time can be represented as the sum of the individual times for each side:

x (first side) + 2x (second and third sides) + 0.5x (fourth side) + 0.5x (fifth side) = total time

Combine like terms:

4x + 0.5x = total time
4.5x = total time

Since we know it takes 5 minutes to get to the first side, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:

4.5x = 4.5(5)
4.5x = 22.5

Now, we can solve for x, but we're actually looking for the total time, which is 4.5x. 

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 22.5 minutes.

**Answer: 22.5**"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the number of helmets is 20, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. This means the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. So, the number of footballs is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since the number of robots is half the number of helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first find out how many calls he deals with in a day. 

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many calls he deals with in an hour.

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Since Tim works 6 hours a day, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per hour by the number of hours he works per day.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per day by the number of days he works per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the time difference, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and compare it to the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

First, let's find the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water. Since half a cup is equivalent to 0.5 cups, we can multiply 4 by 0.5 to get 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. Multiplying 8 by 1 gives us 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water, which is equivalent to 0.25 cups. Multiplying 8 by 0.25 gives us 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the land distance and the water distance separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

The land distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.
The water distance is also 100 yards.

Time taken to cover the land distance = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
Time taken to cover the water distance = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Total time taken = 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for the project, we can use the following calculation:

Number of popsicle sticks needed: 56
Number of sticks per box: 8

To find the number of boxes required, we can divide the total number of sticks needed by the number of sticks per box:

56 Ã· 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box:

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we need to first determine the total number of doughnuts he sells in the month. Since there are 30 days in June and he makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 10 * 12 * 30 doughnuts
= 3600 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June as follows:

3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut
= $7200

The final answer is: $7200"
"To determine the number of days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos Ã· Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 Ã· 7
= 30

Therefore, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To calculate the total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective costs and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00
Then, we'll calculate the cost of the skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

The total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is $47.00."
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speaking speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that on the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, so there were 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, resulting in 140 people.

For the remaining four days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these four days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, we add up the total number of people for all five days:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals of 30 seconds each.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases three times the initial rate, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

The popping rate then increases four times the initial rate in the next 30 seconds, yielding 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, resulting in 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels popped by adding the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels popped is the sum of the kernels popped in each interval and the kernels popped from the residual heat: 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is 210."
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we need to calculate the lemons needed for 5 gallons of lemonade and then add the lemons needed for the extra gallon.

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons/cup * 1 cup/gallon = 6 lemons/gallon

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons needed for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption of both breeds. 

The German Shepherds consume 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. 
The Bulldogs consume 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 
The total daily consumption is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs of the 2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
Next, let's calculate the total number of legs of the 4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Now, let's add the total legs of both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Finally, let's divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks is 32, and the number of blue blocks is 4, while the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blocks can be represented by the equation: 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + r = 32.

To solve for 'r', we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: r = 32 - 12.

r = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can use the concept of relative position. Since Elvis traveled 5 hours west and then 8 hours east, we can consider the westward and eastward distances as vectors. The net displacement is the difference between the eastward and westward distances.

Eastward distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles
Westward distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Net displacement = Eastward distance - Westward distance
Net displacement = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net displacement = 54 miles

Since Elvis is 54 miles east of his starting point, we can conclude that he is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can use the formula for compound depreciation:

Value after n years = Initial value * (1 - Depreciation rate)^n

In this case, the initial value is $9000, the depreciation rate for the first year is 30%, the depreciation rate for the second year is also 30%, and the depreciation rate for the third year is 20%.

We can calculate the value after each year as follows:

Year 1:
Value after 1 year = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

Year 2:
Value after 2 years = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

Year 3:
Value after 3 years = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

Final Answer: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

Since the number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, we can calculate it as follows:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to find the cost of the bus trips first. 

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1.

$80 x 0.1 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

The final answer is: $136"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. We know that Dallas initially had 25 marbles and ended up with 21 after dropping 4. To find out how many marbles Darla received, we can subtract the initial amount of marbles Dallas had from the total number of marbles Mazie gave to the twins.

Let's calculate the number of marbles Darla received:

Total marbles given by Mazie = 52
Initial marbles Dallas had = 25

Number of marbles Darla received = Total marbles given by Mazie - Initial marbles Dallas had
= 52 - 25
= 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets can be determined by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost of an adult ticket, then adding the cost of a child ticket. 

2 adult tickets at $12 each is 2 x $12 = $24. Adding the cost of a child ticket, we get $24 + $8 = $32.

The cost of the popcorns can be found by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost of each popcorn. 2 popcorns at $3 each is 2 x $3 = $6.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns. $32 + $6 = $38.

The family pays a total of $38."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add the lengths of all four sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)

In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma and Mia is 40 years old, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first add the number of seashells found by each individual. 

We have 214 seashells from Tom, 432 seashells from Nancy, and 86 seashells from Benny. 

First, we add the seashells found by each person: 
214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells, which is 67, from the total. 
732 - 67 = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665.

The final answer is: 665"

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week. 

First, we multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we multiply 5 pigs by 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day.

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Next, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7 days to find the total amount of feed consumed in a week.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered to find the amount left.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

To find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy, we can divide the remaining hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 Ã· 6 = 6

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To calculate Frances' total income, we need to consider the revenue generated from both cupcakes and cookies. 

First, let's calculate the total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40
Next, we'll calculate the total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40
Now, we add the total income from cupcakes and cookies: $40 + $40 = $80

Frances' total income is $80.

To determine how much Frances spent on trays, we multiply the number of trays by the cost per tray: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Frances' total expenses are $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income: $80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of arithmetic sequences. Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

To subtract 142 from 1,360, we can use the following steps:

1,360 - 100 = 1,260
1,260 - 40 = 1,220
1,220 - 2 = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The final answer is: 1218"
"To calculate the total amount of money James has, we need to consider the values of each coin. A quarter is worth 25 cents, two nickels are worth 10 cents, and seven dimes are worth 70 cents.

James has a total of 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 12 by 2.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16.

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 

12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break it down into two components: daily time and weekly time.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
3.5 hours + 5 hours = 8.5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8.5}$"
"To calculate the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each type of shirt by its corresponding area and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total area of each type of shirt:
- Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
- Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
- Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can use the relationship between the number of pens Timothy and George own. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can express this as an equation:

Let's represent the number of pens George has as G. Then, Timothy has 3G pens. We know George has 18 pens, so we can substitute 18 for G:

3G = 3(18)
3G = 54

To find the number of pens Timothy has, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

G = 54 / 3
G = 18

Now that we know Timothy has 3 times the number of pens George has, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens:

Timothy's pens = 3G
Timothy's pens = 3(18)
Timothy's pens = 54

Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Jackie's height before the summer is x inches.

We know that Albert is 36 inches tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

We also know that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we can write an equation:

x + 2 = 72

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 72 - 2
x = 70

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we need to subtract 3 from her current height to find her height before the summer:

x - 3 = 70 - 3
x - 3 = 67

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

The final answer is: 67"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. To find the total number of bars produced in two weeks, we multiply 5000 by 14:

5000 * 14 = 70,000

Since the price per bar is $2, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

70,000 * 2 = 140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to break down the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine Ryan's total earnings, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and multiply it by the number of weeks he completed his chores. 

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. He bought 4 cones at $1.25 each, so the total cost is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of each ticket:
13 Ã· 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit for 10 jars is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds, and the cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit for 10 jars is 1.5 * 10 = 15 pounds. The cost of 2 pounds of honey for 10 jars is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
- 20 pounds of passion fruit: 20 * $6 = $120
- 15 pounds of jackfruit: 15 * $8 = $120
- 20 pounds of honey: 20 * $10 = $200
- Total cost of 10 jars: $120 + $120 + $200 = $440

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters: 32 * $0.25 = $8. Multiply 32 by 25 and then divide by 100 to convert to dollars.

Next, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 95 * $0.10 = $9.50. Multiply 95 by 10 and then divide by 100 to convert to dollars.

Now, let's calculate the value of the nickels: 120 * $0.05 = $6. Multiply 120 by 5 and then divide by 100 to convert to dollars.

Lastly, we'll calculate the value of the pennies: 750 * $0.01 = $7.50. Multiply 750 by 1 and then divide by 100 to convert to dollars.

$40 (given by parents) - $28 (total amount spent) = $12

Janet has $12 left."
"To calculate Josh's earnings, we need to determine the total number of working days in 2 weeks. Since Josh is open 6 days a week, we multiply the number of days in a week by the number of weeks:

6 days/week * 2 weeks = 12 days

Next, we calculate the total number of cars serviced in 12 days:

3 cars/day * 12 days = 36 cars

Finally, we multiply the total number of cars by the pay per car to find Josh's total earnings:

36 cars * $4/car = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we'll break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This results in:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. This results in:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. This results in:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This results in:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies

"To calculate the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to consider two separate calculations. 

First, we'll find the total earnings from the first half of his collection. Since there are 6 toys at $5 each, we can multiply 6 by 5 to get the total earnings from this half. 

6 * 5 = 30

Next, we'll find the total earnings from the second half of his collection. Since there are also 6 toys at $7 each, we can multiply 6 by 7 to get the total earnings from this half.

6 * 7 = 42

Now, we'll add the total earnings from both halves to find the overall amount Matthew would earn.

30 + 42 = 72

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To find the total number of days it takes to fill the holes, we can divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we'll subtract the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values of T and P into the equation, we get:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B + 24 = 29

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get:

B = 5

However, we know that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. This means that the number of beakers he lost is 7 - B.

Since B = 5, the number of beakers Igor lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

Now, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws James has: 40 - 32 = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2, since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket.

"The problem presents a scenario where four individuals - Alexandra, Kim, Maryam, and Sarah - are raising money for a carnival. We are given the following information:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.
- Sarah raises $300.

To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add the individual amounts together. 

$430 + $750 = $1180
$1180 + $700 = $1880
$1880 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so we can write the equation:

A = 2V

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and her speed is V. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can write the equation:

4 / V = t

where t is the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. We are also given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles, we can write the equation:

2 / A = 16

Now we have a system of equations:

A = 2V
2 / A = 16
4 / V = t

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:

2 / (2V) = 16
1 / V = 16
V = 1 / 16

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time by substituting V into the equation 4 / V = t:

4 / (1 / 16) = t
4 * 16 = t
t = 64

The final answer is 64."
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can start by multiplying the number of feet of dock by the ratio of line to dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet of dock by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days the restaurant is open. 

First, let's calculate the daily revenue: 
6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
12 meals * $5 per meal = $60
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65

"To calculate the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the cost per unit and then apply the profit margin.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost per unit, we divide the total cost by the number of units:

Cost per unit = Total cost / Number of units
Cost per unit = $80 / 50
Cost per unit = $1.60

Next, we apply the profit margin of 25%. To find the profit amount, we multiply the cost per unit by the profit percentage (as a decimal):

Profit per unit = Cost per unit * Profit percentage
Profit per unit = $1.60 * 0.25
Profit per unit = $0.40

Now, we add the profit per unit to the cost per unit to find the selling price per unit:

Selling price per unit = Cost per unit + Profit per unit
Selling price per unit = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per unit = $2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son James when he was 19. To find John's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since James was born. Since James is now 18, 18 years have passed. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

Now, we need to find the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we subtract the number of years that have passed since John was 32 from John's current age. So, the current age of John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges.

We can continue this pattern, and we can see that Ana will peel x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Jane will peel x, x, x, x, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each subsequent minute.

Let's calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Ana will peel x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + ... + 1 oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of 1, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + 1)
Sum = 30 * (x + 1)

Jane will peel x + x + x + ... + x oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of x, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + x)
Sum = 30 * 2x
Sum = 60x

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Difference = 30 * (x + 1) - 60x
= 30x + 30 - 60x
= -30x + 30

Since x is the number of oranges peeled in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference -30x + 30 is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: $0$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the discounted price of the radiator and add the labor cost.

First, we find 80% of the original price of the radiator: 0.8 * $400 = $320. Then, we subtract this amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the labor cost by multiplying the number of hours by the hourly rate: 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to get the total cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The total cost Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's represent the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

x + y = 20
2x + 4y = 70

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:

2x + 2y = 40
2x + 4y = 70

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
2y = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:

x + y = 20
x + 15 = 20

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 Ã· 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is 14."
