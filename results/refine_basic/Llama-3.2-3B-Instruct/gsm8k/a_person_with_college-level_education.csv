"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. After baking 4 eggs for her friends, she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, her daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we must first establish the amount of each fiber type needed. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also specifies that the amount of white fiber required is half that of the blue fiber.

Given that the amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, to find the total number of bolts required, we add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit made by Josh, we first need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. 

We can calculate the new value by multiplying the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of multiplication. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per week and each sprint covers a distance of 60 meters, we can calculate the total distance by multiplying the number of sprints by the distance per sprint.

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Number of meters per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed required for her flock. Since each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

However, Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed to her chickens. To find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily feed:

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already given
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5. 

For the remaining 15 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each glass, which is 60% of the original price. This can be expressed as 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.

The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is then 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of sheep in each city.

Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T. We are given that S = 20. Additionally, we know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so C = 4S. Lastly, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T = 2C.

Substituting the value of C into the equation T = 2C, we get T = 2(4S) = 8S. Since S = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation to find T: T = 8(20) = 160.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sheep in all three cities by adding the number of sheep in each city: S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we can break down the process into two distinct phases: the initial download and the subsequent restart.

During the initial download, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This phase takes 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

The download is then interrupted and restarted. The restart process itself takes 20 minutes. Following the restart, the download resumes from the beginning, covering the remaining 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. This phase takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time spent during the initial download and the time spent during the restart and subsequent download: 80 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours of driving at a speed of 60 mph. This can be found using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Substituting the given values, we get:

Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Next, John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, resulting in no additional distance traveled. Therefore, the total distance covered so far is still 180 miles.

After the standstill, John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph. Using the same formula, we find:

Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Adding this to the previous total, we get:

Total distance covered so far = 180 + 15 = 195 miles

Finally, John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph. Again, applying the formula:

Distance = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Adding this to the previous total, we get:

Total distance covered = 195 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially traveled 180 miles away from home, we subtract this from the total distance covered to find the distance he is from home:

Distance from home = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

Therefore, John is 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we first need to calculate the regular hourly rate for overtime, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So, the overtime hourly rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12.

Then, we calculate the earnings for the overtime hours:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to find the total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we calculate the number of downloads for each month. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which equals 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

For the third month, the downloads were 30% less than the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, resulting in 54 downloads. 

Now, we add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{294}$"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

The cost of the donuts can be found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs of the donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of years it takes for the tree to break even as 't'. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the annual net profit is $7.50. We can set up the equation:

90 = 7.50t

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7.50:

t = 90 / 7.50
t = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to break even and start generating a profit.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as x.

We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She also sold 2 more at the red house. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house is 5 + (x/3 + 2). We can represent this as an equation: 5 + (x/3 + 2) = y.

We also know that she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold y/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. Since she had y vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: y = 2 * (y/2).

Simplifying the equation, we get: y = y. This equation is true for any value of y, so we need to find another equation to solve for x.

Let's re-examine the information. We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house and 2 more at the red house. This means she had x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left before selling at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x - x - 6 = 15. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 6 = 15. Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 2x = 21. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 10.5.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Melanie initially had 10 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 20% of the total, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of the remaining students, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is then 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

The initial cost of the jewelry is $5,000, and it is expected to increase by 2.5% in the market. The potential value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:

Potential value = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
= $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
= $5,000 * 1.025
= $5,250

On the other hand, the initial cost of the electronic gadgets is $8,000, and it is expected to increase by 1.2% in the market. The potential value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:

Potential value = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
= $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
= $8,000 * 1.012
= $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train, we can utilize the concept of vector addition. Since the trains travel in two different directions, we must consider both the horizontal and vertical components of their displacement.

Let's denote the initial displacement of each train as a vector with components (80, 0), representing 80 miles traveled westward. On the second day, the trains travel 150 miles northward, which can be represented by the vector (0, 150).

To find the resultant displacement, we add the two vectors component-wise:

(80, 0) + (0, 150) = (80, 150)

The magnitude of the resultant vector represents the total distance covered by each train. We can calculate this using the Pythagorean theorem:

√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √28900 ≈ 170 miles

Therefore, each train covers a distance of approximately 170 miles over the two days.

The final answer is: 170"
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we must first calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then sum them.

Jill's annual salary can be calculated as follows:

1. Earnings from teaching: 
- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Weekly earnings: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000

2. Earnings from coaching:
- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Weekly earnings: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500

3. Total annual salary: $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that period. Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, her daily egg consumption is 3. With 7 days in a week, her weekly egg consumption is 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.

Multiplying this by 4 weeks yields a total of 21 * 4 = 84 eggs. To express this in dozens, we divide by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time Marissa has spent so far. 

Given that she walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in 1 hour, the total time spent so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Since Marissa aims to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

As Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain the desired average speed.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 - (4 + 2) = 6 miles.

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we first need to calculate the amount of water in each drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water in the orange drink: 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 17/3 liters of orange drink is 17/3 liters. 

To add these amounts, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite the amount of water in the pineapple drink as 27/3 liters. 

Now, we can add the amounts: 27/3 + 17/3 = 44/3 liters.

To convert this to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 44 ÷ 3 = 14 remainder 2. So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14 2/3 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14 \frac{2}{3}}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can calculate the difference between his current age and the age at which he had his son.

First, we establish Raymond's current age by subtracting the 6-year age difference between him and his cousin, Samantha, from her current age. This yields Raymond's age as 31 - 6 = 25.

Next, we find the age difference between Raymond's current age and the age at which he had his son. This is calculated as 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales into distinct groups and calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

First, we consider the first 3 customers who purchased one DVD each. This results in a total of 3 DVDs sold.

Next, we examine the next 2 customers, who each bought 2 DVDs. Multiplying the number of customers by the number of DVDs purchased per customer yields 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Lastly, we note that the remaining 3 customers made no purchases.

To obtain the overall total, we sum the DVDs sold in each group: 3 (from the first 3 customers) + 4 (from the next 2 customers) + 0 (from the last 3 customers) = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total length of time the candle burns, we first need to calculate the duration between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. This can be done by subtracting the start time from the end time.

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length of melting by multiplying the duration by the rate:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the original price of the book, we can use the concept of discounts. The discounted price is $19.50, and it represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% discount = 75%). 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

75% of x = $19.50
0.75x = $19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we must first calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing, we can calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $16.50. Therefore, the total cost of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Similarly, the cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $22.50. Therefore, the total cost of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, the cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $42. Therefore, the total cost of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, we can find the total amount spent by adding the costs of all items together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The total amount Mishka spent on clothing is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia over 60 days, we can calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream per night, she will require 60 servings in 60 days. Given that each carton contains 15 servings, we can calculate the number of cartons needed as follows:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we must first calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles, and Henry stopped after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can calculate the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop as 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we must re-evaluate the problem. Let's rephrase the question: Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the trip, not from the first stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 40 miles, and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 15 miles. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we add these two distances together:
40 + 15 = 55 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 55 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can start by finding the cost of the two pairs of heels. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, we can set up the equation: B = 99 - 5.

Solving for B, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the boots cost $94."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, as their ages are in the ratio of 7:11.

The total of their ages is given as 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162.

Dividing both sides by 18, we find that x = 9.

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine their current ages: Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To determine the average guess, we must first calculate the number of jelly beans in each person's estimate. 

The first person's estimate is 80 jelly beans. 

The second person's estimate is 20 more than half of the first person's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person's estimate is 25% more than the first person's estimate. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following estimates: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can calculate the total daily care hours by multiplying the number of dogs (10) by the daily care time (0.5 hours).

This yields a daily care time of 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can then multiply the daily care time by 7 to obtain the total weekly care hours.

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs."
"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

Given that the total number of coins is 110, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins, we can calculate the number of gold coins by adding 30 to 'x':

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we are given that Raymond has 40 jewels. We can use this information to find the number of jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as 40 / 2 = 20. Then, we add 5 to this result to find Aaron's total: 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we can find the number of jewels Siobhan has. We are told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total to find Siobhan's total: 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is 23."
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we can break down his performance into two segments: the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we can find 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes and add it to the initial score. 25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

The total points scored by Mike can be found by adding the points scored in both segments: 4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the daily yogurt consumption rate, which is 2 yogurts per day. Multiplying this rate by the number of days (30) yields a total of 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts consumed.

Next, we need to determine the cost of a single yogurt. Given that 4 yogurts are sold for $5.00, we can calculate the cost of one yogurt by dividing the total cost by the quantity: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Finally, we multiply the total number of yogurts consumed (60) by the cost of one yogurt ($1.25) to obtain the total expenditure: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Let's denote the number of Lego sets John initially had as x. Since he sold each set for $15, the total amount he received from selling his Lego sets is 15x.

We know that he spent $20 on 8 video games, which amounts to a total expenditure of 8 * 20 = $160. Additionally, he had $5 left after making this purchase. Therefore, the total amount he had initially can be expressed as 15x = 160 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get 15x = 165.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15, yielding x = 165 / 15.

x = 11

This means John initially had 11 Lego sets. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine John's running speed, we must first calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

Given that he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

Total hours = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total hours = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we must first establish her running and walking speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and this is half of her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which equals 6 miles per hour.

Furthermore, since Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4, yielding 1.5 miles per hour.

With the established speeds, we can now calculate the time Dana spends running and walking within the six-hour timeframe. She spends one-third of the time running, which equates to 2 hours, and two-thirds of the time walking, which amounts to 4 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance Dana covers while running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Finally, we can determine the total distance Dana travels by summing the distances covered while running and walking.

Total distance = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can utilize the given information in a step-by-step manner. 

First, we are informed that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 

Next, we are told that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. This implies that Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Lastly, we are informed that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to consider the relationship between the distance she can throw the javelin with and without the gemstone.

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance with the gemstone is 3x. We know that the dragon's range is 1000 feet, and we want to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside this range.

Since Polly can hit the dragon with the javelin when it is within the dragon's range, we can set up the inequality 3x - 1000 ≥ 0, as she can stand at a distance of 3x from the dragon and still hit it. Solving for x, we get x ≥ 1000/3.

Now, we want to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's range, which is 3x - 1000. Substituting x ≥ 1000/3, we get 3(1000/3) - 1000 = 1000 - 1000 = 0. However, this is the minimum distance she can stand outside the range, and we want the maximum distance. Since the maximum distance is the upper bound of the inequality, we can set 3x - 1000 = 1000, which gives us 3x = 2000, and x = 2000/3.

Now, we can find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's range by subtracting 1000 from 3x: 3(2000/3) - 1000 = 2000 - 1000 = 1000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. After the guests took their pieces, 14 pieces remained. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

T - P = 14

Substituting the value of T, we get:

40 - P = 14

To solve for P, we rearrange the equation to isolate P:

P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the amount of chips you can consume, we first need to calculate the remaining calories available in your daily target. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have with 200 calories remaining.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

As each serving is 100g, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight of chips you can eat.

0.8 * 100 = 80g

Therefore, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we must first determine the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is found by multiplying the number of candles sold by the selling price per candle. In this case, Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, resulting in:

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and he used 1 pound, the cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00. However, we must also account for the cost of the wick, which is $1.00 per candle. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = 10 candles * $1.00 per candle
Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can break down her writing activities for each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total time spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. With each article taking 4 hours, the total time spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days, we add the time spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. 

We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse and used 220 at work. After purchasing the package, she had 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially can be expressed as 80 + x.

Since she used 220 notes at work, the total number of notes she had initially can also be represented as 220 + 23 = 243.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

80 + x = 243

Solving for x, we subtract 80 from both sides:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of blue ties and the cost of a red tie.

First, we can calculate the number of blue ties John purchased. Given that he spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties can be calculated as:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Next, we need to determine the cost of a red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we can calculate:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + ($40 * 0.5)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we must first convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces Tracy obtained. This can be calculated as 48 ÷ 6 = 8.

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we must first calculate the total number of units in the building. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units can be found by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by the fraction representing the occupied portion:

3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we must first calculate the total number of eggs produced and sold in a week. 

Given that his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can find the weekly production by multiplying this rate by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are typically sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Finally, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from egg sales."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we must first calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Given that his speed is 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it takes for him to return. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Given that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of a toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine which day generated more revenue, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day. 

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Thus, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it indicates that the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. Since Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying Trixie's kittens by 3. This yields 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Next, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 48 kittens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we must first calculate the number of lollipops remaining after she consumes 2. This can be achieved by subtracting 2 from the initial quantity of 30 lollipops.

30 - 2 = 28

Next, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2, as Jean wishes to package 2 lollipops in each bag. This division operation yields:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we can employ a simple division operation. The total cost of a movie outing, including the ticket and popcorn, is $14. Given that Peter has $42 available, we can calculate the maximum number of outings as follows:

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we must first calculate the available weight for the boxes. This is achieved by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

The available weight for the boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes by dividing the available weight by the weight of a single box.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15

To avoid fractional results, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as we cannot load a fraction of a box.

Maximum number of boxes = 82.5 ≈ 82

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must first calculate the total amount of the extra fees. The 25% fee is 25% of the original bill, which can be calculated as 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. Additionally, there is a $3.00 delivery fee. Therefore, the total extra fees amount to $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Next, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00. Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to this sum, yielding a final total of $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we must consider the clusters and the individual raspberries separately. 

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster, we can find the total by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries scattered across the bush, which is 67. Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we must first identify the total number of oranges that are not good. This can be achieved by adding the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

The number of bad oranges is given as 1. The number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which can be calculated as 0.2 * 25 = 5. Additionally, there are 2 sour oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of oranges that are not good by adding these three categories: 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid, we must consider the costs associated with the brooch's material, construction, and insurance.

The initial cost of the material is $500. Subsequently, the jeweler's construction costs an additional $800. Therefore, the total cost thus far is $500 + $800 = $1300.

To calculate the insurance cost, we must find 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost to obtain the overall amount paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The total amount Janet paid for the brooch is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, her annual pension is a fixed amount of $50,000. 

After 20 years, her pension becomes a percentage of the original pension value. Since the original pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500. This percentage increase applies to the original pension value, not the annual amount. 

To find the annual pension for the remaining 10 years, we need to calculate 5% of the original pension value ($50,000) and add it to the original pension amount. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. Adding this to the original pension of $50,000 gives us a total of $52,500 for the remaining 10 years.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to consider the monthly charge for the first half of the year and the reduced charge for the second half of the year.

The monthly charge for the first half of the year is $140. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less money. The reduction in monthly charge is:
140 * 0.1 = $14
So, the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can employ a straightforward approach. We know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she has already consumed 4 gallons to fill it up. 

First, we calculate the remaining capacity of the tank: 12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons.

Next, we can find the miles per gallon (mpg) by dividing the distance traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons): 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank by multiplying the remaining capacity of the tank (8 gallons) by the miles per gallon (25): 8 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 200 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we must first calculate the daily hours spent on these activities. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since Jim repeats this pattern 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of individuals sent by the schools, we must consider the number of teams and coaches. Each school has two teams, with five players on each team, resulting in a total of 10 players per school. With four schools participating, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

In addition to the players, each school also sent a coach. Therefore, the total number of coaches is 4 coaches per school * 4 schools = 16 coaches.

The total number of individuals sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 16 coaches = 56 individuals.

The final answer is 56."
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We are given that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so we can express this as R = D - 35.

Additionally, the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, which can be represented as E = 2R.

We are also given that there are 175 diamonds. Substituting this value into the equation R = D - 35, we can solve for the number of rubies: R = 175 - 35 = 140.

Now that we have the value of R, we can find the number of emeralds: E = 2R = 2(140) = 280.

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: Total = D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we must first establish the total number of students. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 60 = 120

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls: 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. 

We can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. 

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so her weekly earnings can be calculated as 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we must first identify the number of instructions in each recipe. 

The first recipe contains 20 instructions. Since the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, we can calculate its number of instructions by multiplying the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2. 

2 * 20 = 40

Now, we can find the total number of instructions by adding the number of instructions in both recipes.

Total instructions = 20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes."
"To determine the total amount of money Tommy raises, we can calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum them up.

Let's start by calculating the revenue from the brownies. Since each brownie is sold for $3 and Tommy sells 43 brownies, the total revenue from brownies is 43 * $3 = $129.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake is sold for $4, and Tommy sells 23 cheesecakes, resulting in a total revenue of 23 * $4 = $92.

To find the overall total, we add the revenue from the brownies and cheesecakes: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To determine the total amount Shiela will pay each month for the 3-month installment, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the cost of the cell phone.

The cost of each cell phone is $150, and a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. The interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is $150 + $3 = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay each month is 5 x $153 = $765.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $765 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $765"
"To determine Artie's total revenue, we must first calculate the revenue generated from each type of flower and then sum these amounts.

The revenue from marigolds can be found by multiplying the number of pots sold (12) by the price per pot ($2.74). This yields $32.88. Rounding this to the nearest dollar results in $33.

The revenue from petunias is obtained by multiplying the number of pots sold (9) by the price per pot ($1.87), which equals $16.83. Rounding this to the nearest dollar gives $17.

The revenue from begonias is calculated by multiplying the number of pots sold (17) by the price per pot ($2.12), resulting in $35.64. Rounding this to the nearest dollar gives $36.

To find the total revenue, we add the revenues from each type of flower: $33 + $17 + $36 = $86.

The final answer is: $86"
"To determine the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we must first calculate the total square footage of all levels. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as follows:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

The sum of the square footage of all levels is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels, which is 4. Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 / 110 = 8.27 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can start by establishing the relative laundry loads of each individual. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this relationship as a ratio: David's laundry : Sarah's laundry = 1 : 4. Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate David's laundry load by dividing Sarah's load by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can express this relationship as a ratio: Raymond's laundry : Sarah's laundry = 1 : 2. Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate Raymond's laundry load by dividing Sarah's load by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we must evaluate the total cost of each option.

Option 1: Purchasing in packages of 3 for $2.50
The number of packages required can be calculated by dividing the total number of flowers (18) by the package size (3), resulting in 6 packages. The total cost for this option is then 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Option 2: Purchasing in packages of 2 for $1
Similarly, the number of packages needed can be found by dividing the total number of flowers (18) by the package size (2), yielding 9 packages. The total cost for this option is 9 * $1 = $9.

Given that $9 is less than $15, purchasing in packages of 2 for $1 is the more cost-effective option.

The amount of money saved by choosing the better option is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The discount offered is 30% of the original cost. 

First, we need to find 30% of the original cost. This can be calculated by multiplying the original cost by 0.3.

Original cost = $100
Discount = 0.3 x $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water initially allocated to the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

This means the two girls collectively received 4 liters of water. Next, we add the 6 liters allocated to the boy:

4 liters (girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 10 liters

Now, we subtract the total amount of water distributed from the initial 24 liters to find the amount left:

24 liters - 10 liters = 14 liters

Therefore, there were 14 liters of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 more stickers from a store and received 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This results in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers for a greeting card. To find the total number of stickers he has left, we need to subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total. 

First, subtract the stickers given away: 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
Then, subtract the stickers used: 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can start by calculating Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, we can find the combined weight by adding Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds"
"To determine the total number of thorns, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. We start by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Number of rose bushes: 3
2. Number of roses per bush: 25
3. Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Next, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides yields:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 7

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of games won by adding 8 to x:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Gene has been vacationing for 11 years, and he goes on 4 vacations per year. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks can be found by multiplying the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of vacations he takes per year.

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks

The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we must first calculate the duration of each ring and then sum them up.

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as 'a'. According to the problem, the second ring lasted three times as long as the first, so its duration is 3a. The third ring, on the other hand, was half as long as the second, making its duration 1.5a.

The total duration of the alarm ringing is the sum of the durations of each ring: a + 3a + 1.5a. Combining like terms, we get 5.5a.

Since the problem doesn't provide the actual duration of the first ring, we can't determine the exact total number of times the alarm rang. However, we can express the total number of times the alarm rang in terms of 'a'. 

The total number of times the alarm rang is 5.5a.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.5a}$"
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can use the concept of compound interest. 

We start with the initial salary of $600 and apply a 10% annual increase for each year. 

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7: 
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8: 
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9: 
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10: 
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

The final answer is $1556.25."
"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x. The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is 8,000."
"To determine the total cost of the gift bags, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up, we can find the number of attendees by multiplying the total number of invited guests by 3/4.

Let's calculate the number of attendees: (3/4) * 16 = 12

Next, we need to find the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, and Christina needs 12 gift bags. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag:

12 * $2 = $24

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her party.

The final answer is: $24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic, we must consider the distinct consumption patterns of adult and child dinosaurs. 

First, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs. With 20 adults attending, each consuming 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount required for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we consider the child dinosaurs. Since children consume half the amount of an adult, each child requires 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. With 5 children attending, the total amount required for children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the overall amount of potato salad needed, we sum the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia's pet count can be expressed as x + 2. Jan, having three times the number of pets as Marcia, can be represented as 3(x + 2).

We are given that Cindy has four pets, so x = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pet counts, we get Marcia's pet count as 4 + 2 = 6 and Jan's pet count as 3(4 + 2) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the individual counts: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can utilize the given information about the age differences between the children. 

We are given that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This implies that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Furthermore, we know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age can be calculated as 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, it is stated that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age can be determined by subtracting 5 from Amy's age, resulting in 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between Lee's and Gerald's times. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Lee's time as x + 2.

We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 36

This indicates that Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

To find Gerald's new time after his diet change, we need to calculate the 10% improvement in his speed. A 10% improvement means that his new time will be 90% of his original time, plus the 10% improvement. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

New time = 0.9x + 0.1x

Since we know x = 36, we can substitute this value into the equation:

New time = 0.9(36) + 0.1(36)
New time = 32.4 + 3.6
New time = 36

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to recalculate the 10% improvement. The correct calculation is:

New time = 0.9x
New time = 0.9(36)
New time = 32.4

Since Gerald's original time was 36 seconds, and his speed improved by 10%, his new time should be 90% of his original time, which is 32.4 seconds."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, we can express this relationship as C = 2D. We are also told that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which can be written as R = D + C - 12.

Substituting C = 2D into the equation for R, we get R = D + 2D - 12 = 3D - 12.

We are given that the number of dogs (D) is 60. Substituting this value into the equation for R, we find R = 3(60) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Let's calculate the number of girls: 
Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Now, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the difference in the number of hours Harry and James slept, we can calculate the fraction of the hours Harry slept that James slept.

Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hours James slept. Let's denote the number of hours James slept as 'x'. The proportion can be written as:

2/3 = x / 9

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

2 * 9 = 3x
18 = 3x

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate 'x':

x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, James slept 6 hours.

To find the difference in the number of hours Harry and James slept, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we must first calculate the total volume of tomatoes she utilized. Since she lost half of the volume during the cooking process, we can infer that she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce.

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. Given that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used by dividing the volume of tomatoes used (16 ounces) by the volume of tomatoes in a single can (16 ounces).

16 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 1 can

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans used by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes used.

1 can * 3 tomatoes per can = 3 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda used 3 tomatoes.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we must first calculate the total number of potted plants she currently possesses. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of potted plants per window ledge (2) by the total number of window ledges (40).

Total potted plants = 2 * 40 = 80

Next, we must account for the 18 new potted plants Mary received from her favorite plant nursery. This can be done by adding the new plants to the existing total.

Total potted plants = 80 + 18 = 98

Finally, we must subtract the number of potted plants Mary plans to give away (40) from the total to determine the number she will have left.

Total potted plants remaining = 98 - 40 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we can analyze the information provided. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as x. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which can be expressed as (1 + 1/4)x = (5/4)x.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, who pressed the doorbell 60 times. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of doorbell rings:

x + (5/4)x + 70 + 60 = total number of doorbell rings

Combine like terms:

(9/4)x + 130 = total number of doorbell rings

Since we are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can set up an equation using the information that the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times more than the fourth friend:

(9/4)x + 130 = 60 + 70

Simplify the equation:

(9/4)x + 130 = 130

"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has left to read. 

The total number of pages from all the textbooks is 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages. Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left to complete his reading, which is 4 days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John consumes 1 glass of water per meal, which translates to 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, his total water intake on weekdays is 3 glasses/day * 5 days = 15 glasses.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday but consumes a soda with dinner on Sunday, so his water intake on weekends is 1 glass. 

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 15 (weekdays) + 1 (Saturday) = 16 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. The city's width is 42 miles, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

We can calculate the total time required by dividing the city's width by the rate at which it is covered. This yields:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, it will take 14 sets of these 10-minute intervals to cover the entire city. Therefore, the total time required is 14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces. This can be expressed as 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Next, we find the remaining pieces after Poppy's contribution, which is 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

Then, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces. This can be expressed as 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Finally, we find the remaining pieces after Poppy's mom's contribution, which is 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. Since Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's amount by 3, resulting in 15 cookies. 

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by both individuals by adding their respective amounts: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from the outer dimensions to obtain the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as the product of its inner dimensions:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which amounts to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, adding another 2 hours to his total.

The combined time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he spent watching on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total time spent on other days from the overall total: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Converting 1.5 hours to minutes yields 90 minutes.

Dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode results in 3 episodes.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry aims to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, resulting in 2x cookies. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than intended, leading to a total of 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies.

We are given that the final count of cookies is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the gas by multiplying the number of gallons purchased (10) by the price per gallon ($3.00). This yields a total cost of $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the number of gallons purchased (10) by the cashback amount per gallon ($0.20). This results in a cashback amount of $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost to obtain the final cost of the gas after the rewards. Therefore, the total cost is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups consumed by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups each individual consumed.

Beatrice's roll-ups can be calculated by multiplying the width (2) by the length (24), resulting in 48 roll-ups. Similarly, Marcell's roll-ups can be calculated by multiplying the width (3) by the length (14), yielding 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups consumed by both individuals is the sum of their individual totals, which is 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average number of roll-ups consumed, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2, resulting in an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the total amount of water the boat took on, we can first calculate the number of 20-foot intervals Julia rowed to reach the shore. Given that the shore was 64 seconds away and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total number of 20-foot intervals by dividing the total time by the time it took to row 20 feet.

64 seconds / 16 seconds per 20 feet = 4 intervals

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 20 feet. To find the total amount of water taken on, we can multiply the number of 20-foot intervals by the amount of water taken on per interval.

4 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 8 liters

Therefore, the boat took on 8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. 

We start by identifying the key components of the problem: the number of teachers, the number of lessons per day, and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. 

Given that each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, we can calculate the total number of lessons per day as 4 teachers * 2 lessons = 8 lessons. 

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we then multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: 8 lessons * 3 cleanings = 24 cleanings.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we calculate the total number of flowers planted by multiplying the daily rate (2 flowers) by the number of days (15). This yields 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. 

However, we are informed that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that actually grew, we subtract the non-growing flowers from the total: 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can start by dividing the total number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6, as his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can calculate the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as follows:

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs on Brittany's phone is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide the number of photographs on Brittany's phone by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine Sasha's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has. The 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. The 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have increased by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up an equation based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as 7x and the number of cups of water as 13x. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can write the equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying 7 and x:

7 * 6 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid, we can employ the concept of multiplication. Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, we can calculate the total number of pairs of shoes as 2 pairs/child * 3 children = 6 pairs.

Given that each pair of shoes costs $60, the total cost can be found by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 6 pairs * $60/pair = $360.

Therefore, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can use a simple subtraction approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as x.

We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can set up the equation:

10 + 5x = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

5x = 20

Dividing both sides by 5 yields:

x = 4

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we first need to calculate their individual salaries at that time.

Given that Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago and increased by 30% to reach his current salary, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 30% of $40,000
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Next, we can find Lylah's salary four years ago by setting up an equation based on the fact that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769.23

Now, we can calculate Lylah's current salary by adding 40% of her old salary to her old salary.

40% of $30,769.23 is 0.4 * $30,769.23 = $12,307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
= $43,076.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is the sum of their individual salaries:
Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $52,000 + $43,076.92
= $95,076.92

The final answer is: $95,076.92"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of sheets used per week. Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, we can calculate the total sheets used per week as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we need to account for the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a 4-week month, we can multiply the sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we can analyze their individual contributions.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, resulting in a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

The combined total of their fruits is 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep patterns by day.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, resulting in 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday. The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, which means she slept 5 hours on Thursday, 6 hours on Friday, 7 hours on Saturday, and 8 hours on Sunday.

To find the total hours slept, we can sum the hours for each day: 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we can break down her running into two distinct periods. 

First, we calculate the distance covered during the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. This can be found by multiplying the speed by the time: 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance covered during the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour. This can be found by multiplying the speed by the time: 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of these two distances: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60. This implies that the number of letters she put stamps on is 60/3 = 20.

After Jennie put stamps on 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters became 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Thus, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

We know that her husband gave her 5 additional spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. Therefore, the total number of spoons she had at the end can be represented as x + 5 - 3.

We are given that the total number of spoons she had at the end is 12. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides yields:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia initially purchased contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of fish sausages as 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. Given that the number of chicken sausages is 38, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize a simple arithmetic approach. 

Given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friend count by adding 20 to Lily's friend count. This yields Amy's friend count as 50 + 20 = 70.

Subsequently, we can find the total number of friends by adding Amy's and Lily's friend counts together: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing, we must first establish the cost of each individual item. 

Given that a pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon by multiplying the cost of a pepper by 3, yielding $45. 

Furthermore, we can calculate the cost of an orange by subtracting $5 from the cost of a watermelon, resulting in $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers cost 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges cost 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880."
"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total time spent on patients and the revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments.

First, we calculate the total time spent on patients. With 500 people visiting the hospital daily and each patient being seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent on patients can be found by multiplying the number of people by the time spent per person: 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated from the hospital's charges. The hospital charges $150 per hour, so the total revenue from the doctors' charges is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

We also need to consider the revenue generated from the patients' payments. With 500 people visiting the hospital daily and each paying $200, the total revenue from patients is 500 people * $200/person = $100,000.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the hospital's charges and the patients' payments: $30,000 + $100,000 = $130,000.

The total cost is the sum of the hospital's charges and the patients' payments, which is $30,000 + $100,000 = $130,000.

However, the total cost and total revenue are the same, indicating that the hospital is operating at a break-even point. Therefore, the profit made by the hospital is $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can find this number by dividing the total number of elves by 3. 

60 / 3 = 20

This means 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Next, we need to account for the elves that quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these elves from the remaining total. 

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we can calculate the expenditure in June by subtracting $60 from the expenditure in May. This yields $500 - $60 = $440. 

The total expenditure is then the sum of the expenditures in May and June, which is $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we must consider the individual ticket expenditures for both Pam and Fred. 

Pam's roller coaster rides resulted in 2 * 6 = 12 tickets, while Fred's roller coaster rides yielded 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. Additionally, both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times, which equates to 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

Combining these expenditures, we find that the total number of tickets used is 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday. 

Given that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 6 times as many miles on Tuesday, we can express the miles walked on Tuesday as 6 * 4 = 24 miles. 

Now, we can find the miles walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday. 

Total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday = 41 miles
Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To determine the total annual cost of car washes for Tom, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of car washes per month (4) by the number of months in a year (12), which yields 48 car washes. Then, we multiply this result by the cost of each car wash ($15) to obtain the total annual cost.

48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we must first calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Given that Brian initially had 20 video games, we can find the number of video games he has now by subtracting 5 from 20, yielding 15 video games.

Next, we can express the number of video games Bobby has in terms of Brian's video games using the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5

Substituting the value of Brian's video games (15) into the equation, we get:

Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to establish the total number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one-third of the total unicorns are located in this region, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of unicorns by 1/3.

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns * (1/3) = 27 * (1/3) = 9

Next, we can find the number of female Scottish unicorns by multiplying the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3, as two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.

Female Scottish unicorns = Scottish unicorns * (2/3) = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we must first determine the cost of each item and then add them together. 

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00. 
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. 
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

A 20% delivery fee is applied to the total cost of the items, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the order, including the delivery fee, is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip to her order. Therefore, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we first need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests. 

Mark completed 40 questions in the first test, which lasted for 8 hours, and 30 questions in the second test, which lasted for 6 hours. 

The total number of questions completed is the sum of the questions completed in both tests: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions, we can find the number of questions left incomplete by subtracting the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in the first test: 
75 - 70 = 5 questions

Therefore, Mark left 5 questions incomplete."
"To determine the number of pink gumballs, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This relationship can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

We are given that the number of blue gumballs is 12. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to identify the total number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can express this relationship as W = 2B. Additionally, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B = 2 * 200 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees."
"To determine the weekly earnings of Jordan if he were to utilize his video game time for work, we must first calculate the total hours he would work in a week. Given that he dedicates 2 hours daily to video games, his weekly gaming time would be 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Subsequently, his hourly wage is $10. Multiplying this by the total hours worked in a week yields his weekly earnings: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

Therefore, if Jordan were to substitute his video game time with work, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The total cost of the food items is $5 (milk and eggs), and the total cost of the non-food items is $10 (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps).

The tax rate on non-food items is 10%, so we calculate the tax amount as follows:
$10 (non-food items) * 0.10 (10% tax) = $1

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items:
$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax):
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $16.

$16"
"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we must first determine the total expenses associated with cleaning the homes of his clients. 

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. With 8 clients (3 initial clients + 5 potential clients), the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16. The cost of these bottles is 16 * $2 = $32. Similarly, the total number of packs of cloths required is 8 * 1 = 8, and their cost is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses can be calculated as the sum of the cost of bleach and cloths: $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is given as $92. To find his profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we must first calculate the total number of pineapples per year. Given that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the total number of pineapples per year is:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we can calculate the total number of harvests in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per year by the frequency of harvesting (4, since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we must first calculate the number of pieces in each box. 

The first box contains 500 pieces. The second box has three times more pieces than the first, so it contains 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has one-fourth the number of pieces as the first, so it contains 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces by adding the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct periods.

First, we note that 30 bees leave the hive in the initial 6 hours. Then, in the subsequent 6 hours, half of these bees return, which amounts to 15 bees. This brings the total number of bees that have returned to 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the second period) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left initially leave the hive, which equates to 2 * 30 = 60 bees. However, we must consider that 15 bees had already returned, so the number of bees that left in the third period and hadn't returned yet is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Now, we know that all the bees that left in the first three periods (excluding those that had already returned) return to the hive in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left in the third period, which is 45 bees.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can employ a straightforward approach. The total cost of the tickets is calculated by adding the cost of an adult ticket ($12) to the cost of a child ticket ($10), resulting in a total cost of $22.

Given that Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can infer that the amount she provided to the cashier is the sum of the total cost and the change. Therefore, the amount given to the cashier is $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends Charlie and Dorothy have. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this relationship as:

Charlie's friends = 3x

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

James' friends = 4x
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house, we must first convert the distances to a common unit. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we can calculate the time it takes for each individual to complete the journey:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we can find the time Tim will be waiting by subtracting Steve's time from Tim's time:

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we must calculate the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum the results.

First, we calculate the total cost for bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * $0.25 = $2.50. 

Next, we calculate the total cost for tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * $0.25 = $2.25.

Lastly, we calculate the cost for the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * $0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we add the amounts together: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To determine the amount of change Carl receives, we must first calculate the total cost of the cookies. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack, and then multiplying the result by the cost per cookie.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Now, we need to find the change Carl receives after paying with a $10 bill. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:

$10 - $6 = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to backtrack the sequence of events and determine the initial number of french fries in the pack.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as 'x'. We know that after the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, the remaining fries were 5. Since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, we can express this as:

Seagull's share = (1/2) * Dave's share
(1/2) * x = 5
x = 10

However, this is not the correct initial number of fries. We need to consider the subsequent events.

After the seagull ate, the remaining fries were 5. Then, three pigeons ate 9 fries, leaving 5 behind. This implies that before the pigeons ate, there were 14 fries. 

Now, we know that the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 14. Let's express this as an equation:

Raccoon's share = (2/3) * Remaining fries
(2/3) * x = 14
x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each type of day and then sum them up.

Kimo's class schedule consists of three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, resulting in a total of 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. Given that there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent on these days is 9 * 16 = 144 hours.

On the other hand, Kimo has two 2-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, resulting in a total of 4 hours per day. With 2 days of this schedule per week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Over 16 weeks, this amounts to 8 * 16 = 128 hours.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we add the hours spent on both types of days: 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches.

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in feet = (1200 + 720 + 2880) / 12
Total length in feet = 4800 / 12
Total length in feet = 400 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we must consider the monthly requirements of each ape species and then calculate the total demand over the specified period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, however, need 100 bananas per month. To find the total monthly demand, we add these amounts together: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total demand for 2 months. We multiply the monthly demand by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we must calculate the total distance each individual ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth (15) by the length of the football field (100 yards), resulting in 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated by first determining the total distance she ran on the field (100 yards * 34 times = 3400 yards) and then adding the additional distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back (80 yards * 34 times = 2720 yards). Therefore, her total distance is 3400 + 2720 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find the difference in their distances, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"

Now, we can find the total amount spent by adding the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The total amount Raphael spent on everything is $34."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we must consider the changes in the tadpole population. Initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles. However, 6 of them emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 of them subsequently hid under a rock. 

To find the current number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the initial total. This can be calculated as follows:

11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that emerged) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

Therefore, Finn can see 7 tadpoles in the pond.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we establish the initial depth of water in the tank on Monday, which is given as 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, resulting in a depth of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we are told that the depth of the water on Wednesday is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To find this value, we can use the formula for two-thirds of a quantity, which is (2/3) * quantity. In this case, the quantity is 24 feet. 

Thus, the depth of the water on Wednesday is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can analyze the information provided.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Additionally, Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, resulting in 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Lastly, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, leading to 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fish caught by each individual and then sum them up. Anakin's total is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin's total is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the situation using exponential growth. The initial price is $20, and the price increases by 20% every 2 months.

Let's denote the price after n months as Pn. We can express the price after 2 months as P2 = 1.20P0, where P0 is the initial price. Similarly, the price after 4 months is P4 = 1.20P2 = (1.20)2P0, and so on.

We can generalize this pattern to find the price after 36 months: P36 = (1.20)18P0.

Since P0 = $20, we can substitute this value into the equation: P36 = (1.20)18 * $20.

Using a calculator, we can evaluate this expression: P36 ≈ $532.74.

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $532.74."
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we can establish the cost of each type of toy using the given information.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

Additionally, we know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

Furthermore, we are informed that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

With the individual costs established, we can calculate the total value of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the amount of money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to consider the trade-off between her potential loss of income from doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring a professional.

The opportunity cost of doing her taxes herself is the potential income she would have earned by working 3 fewer hours, with each hour valued at $35. This can be calculated as:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

In contrast, hiring an accountant costs $90. To find the net gain from hiring the accountant, we subtract the cost from the opportunity cost:

$105 (opportunity cost) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we must first calculate the total cost of the computer accessories. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items: 

Computer: €1090
Scanner: €157
CD burner: €74
Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Given that Elvira's budget is €1500, we can find the remaining amount for her clothing by subtracting the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: €77"
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we can use a simple division problem. Since she requires 3 eggs per babysitting session and needs a total of 15 eggs for the Spanish flans, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs obtained per session.

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the required 15 eggs.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote Seth's current age as x and Brooke's current age as y. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented by the equation x + 2 + y + 2 = 28.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation, we get 2y + 2 + y + 2 = 28.

Combining like terms, we have 3y + 4 = 28.

Subtracting 4 from both sides yields 3y = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that y = 8.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute y = 8 into this equation to find x: x = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Jimmy's total amount of money, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as 'E'. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has. This can be expressed as 2E + 2.

We are given that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute E = 8 into the equation. Therefore, Jimmy's total amount of money is 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total miles walked in a week, we can calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately. 

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

The total miles walked in a week is the sum of the miles walked on weekdays and weekends, which is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The cost of the hat is $25. Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, its cost can be calculated as 3 × $25 = $75. 

The pants, on the other hand, cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. This can be found by adding the costs of the hat and jacket and then dividing by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we must calculate the legs of each type of creature and sum them together.

First, we calculate the total legs of the spiders. Since there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, the total number of spider legs is 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, we calculate the total legs of the insects. There are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

Lastly, we calculate the total legs of the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we are given that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is stated to be the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Next, we are informed that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age can be calculated as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Lastly, we are told that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Consequently, Sally Two's age can be determined as 16 + 3 = 19 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds by adding their individual ages: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine Jessica's annual debt payment, we must first calculate her monthly payment, which consists of the sum of the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

The minimum payment for her student loans is $300, her credit card's minimum is $200, and her mortgage's minimum is $500. Therefore, the total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. This can be found by multiplying the total minimum payment by 0.5, which equals $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment to obtain Jessica's new monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find the annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12. Thus, $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time required to prepare the potatoes, we must first calculate the time it takes to peel and cut a single potato. The time to peel a potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut it is 5 seconds. 

Converting the time to cut a potato to minutes, we have 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes. 

The total time to prepare one potato is the sum of these two values: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Now, we multiply this value by the number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds for easier understanding, we have 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"To determine the amount Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we must first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Given that they sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50 and obtain 20 glasses per gallon, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. 

Since they made a profit of $25, we can establish the equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This represents the total cost for 1 gallon. As they require lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To determine the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Therefore, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $35 on lemons.

$35"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls on the team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants.

Total Asian participants = 240
Number of Japanese participants = 80
Total Chinese participants = Total Asian participants - Number of Japanese participants
= 240 - 80
= 160

Next, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, there were 100 Chinese girls on the team.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after accounting for his various expenses and donations, we can break down his expenditures into distinct categories.

First, we calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel. Zaid spends 1/4 of his monthly income on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars. He also spends 1/3 of his income on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars. The combined total for these expenses is 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars.

The remaining amount after these expenses is 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250 dollars. The amount left after this donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Finally, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, totaling 900 dollars. The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all his expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can start by establishing the number of crabs each person possesses. 

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crab count as 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani, on the other hand, has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, Rani's crab count can be determined as 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can calculate the total number of crabs by adding the individual counts: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them.

Lloyd earns $10 per hour. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, resulting in earnings of $10 * 5 = $50. In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, yielding earnings of $10 * 8 = $80.

The total earnings for the first two weeks can be found by adding the earnings from each week: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received can be found by subtracting the number of votes the winner received from the total:

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be expressed as 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. This relationship can be represented as 5x = 200, where x is the number of white carnations. Solving for x, we find that x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of red roses by substituting x into the equation 4x. This yields 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Jean's current age, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J and Mark's current age as M. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can express this as J = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old, half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 20 + 2 = 22.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can substitute M = 22 into the equation J = M + 2 to find Jean's current age: J = 22 + 2 = 24.

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we must first calculate the total time for each team. 

The less well-rounded team's first runner covers the 400-meter distance in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for the subsequent runners are 57 seconds, 54 seconds, and 51 seconds.

The total time for the less well-rounded team is the sum of these individual times: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team, on the other hand, has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Thus, their total time is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The time difference between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we can utilize the concept of discrete uniform probability. Since a standard six-sided die is being used, each outcome has an equal likelihood of 1/6. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, resulting in a probability of 3/6 = 1/2.

On the other hand, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row can be calculated by considering the product of the probabilities of each event. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, as there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of the 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also 3/6. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

To determine the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25%"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother as 'x'. Then, Jenna's share would be x/2.

Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, we can set up the equation x = 20 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Now, we can calculate Jenna's share by substituting the value of x into the expression x/2, which yields 20/2 = 10 apples.

The total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is the sum of their individual shares, which is 20 (mother's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we must first calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters are housed in 10 cages, with each cage receiving 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are housed in a single pen, receiving 20 pieces of straw. Thus, the total straw used for the rabbits is 20.

The combined straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total straw used is 160, the straw used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are distributed across 3 cages, with each rat receiving 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw used for the rats is 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total straw used for the rats (18) by the number of rats (6), yielding 18 / 6 = 3.

However, this calculation is incorrect as it does not account for the fact that the rats are distributed across 3 cages. To find the correct number of rats in each cage, we must divide the total number of rats (90) by the number of cages (3), resulting in 90 / 3 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay to Benedict, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = the total amount to be paid (principal + interest)
P = principal amount ($100)
r = monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02)
t = time in months (3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.02*3)
A = 100(1 + 0.06)
A = 100(1.06)
A = 106

Therefore, Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue from selling the bags at $30 each is 30x. The total cost consists of the cost of purchasing the bags at $20 each and the transportation cost of $2 per bag. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit made from selling the bags is given as $400. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, so we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the individual cost per person, we must first calculate the total expenses incurred by the three friends. 

The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and the cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. Therefore, the cost of the food can be calculated as follows:

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides, which is $33 per ride for two rides. 

Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since the friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to determine the individual cost per person.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we first convert this duration to minutes, as the rate of collection is given in peaches per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the total minutes by the rate of collection, which is 2 peaches per minute. This yields 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To determine the daily insect requirement for the flock of ducks, we must first calculate the total weekly requirement and then divide it by the number of days in a week.

The total weekly insect requirement is given as 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the daily requirement by dividing the total weekly requirement by 7.

Daily insect requirement = Total weekly requirement / Number of days in a week
Daily insect requirement = 3.5 / 7
Daily insect requirement = 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the ducks require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To determine the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we calculate the total number of trees Tom plants over 10 years. Since he plants 10 trees per year, the total number of trees planted is 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.

Next, we need to account for the trees that Tom chops down each year. He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he would have removed 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.

Now, we calculate the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping. This is given by the difference between the total number of trees planted and the total number of trees chopped down: 100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3, which equals 24 trees.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping: 80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, we can break down the events that occurred.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors removed one-third of the flamingos, which equates to 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. The 6 removed flamingos were then repainted white and reintroduced to the yard. Consequently, the number of white flamingos increased to 6, while the number of pink flamingos remained at 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos became 12 + 18 = 30, and the total number of white flamingos remained at 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the amount of change Violetta will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she requires 5 crayons, each costing $2, the total cost can be found by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Given that Violetta has $20, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount she has.

Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we must first establish the cost of a single pen. Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, and the individual costs of a pencil ($1.20) and an eraser ($0.30), we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to the 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, the total amount distributed is 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

Next, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount that will not be used: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory. The total population consists of three distinct groups: men, women, and children. Given that the total population is 23786, and the number of men and women are 8417 and 9092, respectively, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the sum of men and women from the total population.

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we can break down her card collection into three distinct periods.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 cards. This brings her total to 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Adding these to her previous total, we get 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined total from the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice this amount is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. Adding these to her previous total, we get 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts. First, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Let's denote the number of sentences for each publisher as x. We know that x + x = 1000, since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. Solving for x, we get:

2x = 1000
x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, his earnings from Publisher B are:

500 sentences * 10 cents = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we can add his earnings from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must first calculate the amount of water he receives in the morning and the amount he receives in the afternoon, then sum these values.

In the morning, Baldur collects 5 pails of water, with each pail containing 5 liters. Therefore, the morning water collection is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, he collects 6 pails of water, with each pail also containing 5 liters. Thus, the afternoon water collection is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

The total amount of water Baldur receives daily is the sum of the morning and afternoon collections: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward he received as a one-time payment. 

First, we calculate his weekly earnings: $2000. There are 52 weeks in a year, so his total earnings before the award would be $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

The monetary reward he received is $5,000. This is a one-time payment and does not affect his weekly or annual salary. Therefore, we simply add this amount to his total earnings: $104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000.

The raise mentioned in the problem is irrelevant to his total earnings, as it is a separate entity from his salary.

"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. 

First, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre, which yields 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons. 

Next, we then multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton, resulting in 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must consider the various instances in which he consumed cheese throughout the week.

Carl's lunch consisted of a sandwich every day, with each sandwich utilizing 2 slices of cheese. Given that there are 7 days in a week, the total number of slices used for lunch can be calculated as 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

In addition to his lunch, Carl also consumed cheese and egg omelets for breakfast on 3 separate days. It is stated that he used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. Consequently, the total number of slices used for breakfast can be calculated as 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

Furthermore, Carl prepared a large dish of macaroni and cheese, which required 8 slices of cheese.

To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must sum the slices used for each meal: 14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we must consider the initial quantities of each color and the additional pens she acquired.

Janet initially possessed 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Subsequently, she acquired 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens, resulting in a total of 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. Furthermore, she purchased 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens, yielding a total of 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

To calculate the overall number of pens, we sum the initial quantities and the additional pens: 22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98.

The total number of pens Janet now possesses is 98."
"To determine the required score on the sixth test, we must first calculate the total score of the first five tests. 

The sum of the scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. 

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score, which is 71. 

Subtracting 71 from the total score yields 438 - 71 = 367.

To achieve an average of 93, we must calculate the total score for six tests. Multiplying the desired average by 6 gives us 93 * 6 = 558.

Subtracting the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score results in 558 - 367 = 191.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down his riding activities into two distinct periods. 

In the first period, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers covered in this period would be 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal reduced his frequency to 2 times a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time. This can be calculated as 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times. Therefore, the total kilometers covered in this period would be 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.

To find the overall total, we add the kilometers covered in both periods: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as follows:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of a single candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of cakes purchased each day and then summing them up.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which can be calculated as 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which can be calculated as 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To determine the cost of each cup, we can start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Next, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we must first calculate the total amount she requires to purchase the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 x 2 = $70.

Sara already possesses $10, thus she needs to earn an additional $60. Her earnings from babysitting amount to $5 per session, while her earnings from mowing the lawn amount to $4 per session. 

To calculate the number of babysitting sessions required to earn $60, we can divide $60 by $5:
$60 / $5 = 12

However, this is not the answer we are seeking. We must determine the number of lawn mowing sessions needed to earn $60. To accomplish this, we can divide $60 by $4:
$60 / $4 = 15

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to purchase the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs per day and white chickens producing 5 eggs per day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Next, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed, which is 3 miles per hour:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can start by establishing the number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50. 

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this total is 250. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2: x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150).

The total number of customers on the third day is given as 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is 250."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up a system of equations. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y, since the big pool has lost 16 gallons of water.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we can calculate the total amount she needs to earn by adding the cost of the shoes and the belt. This sum represents the total cost of the items.

Total cost = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

Number of hours = Total cost ÷ Hourly wage
= $352.00 ÷ $8.00
= 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

Final answer: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay. The additional amount she needs to pay is 10% of the initial amount of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay:

$165 x 12 = $1980

The remaining balance will be the difference between the total amount she needs to pay and the total amount she will pay:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. We are given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses. This implies that the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

By adding the number of roses and dahlias, we can calculate the total number of flowers in the vase. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we must first establish their current ages based on the given information.

Given that Harriet's age is 21 years, and she is half the age of Zack, we can deduce that Zack's age is twice Harriet's age, which is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Furthermore, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can calculate Adrian's age as 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Therefore, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we can find the total points scored by the three students by adding their individual scores: 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."
"To determine the total time spent on these activities, we can calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then sum the results.

The time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated by multiplying the number of puzzles (3) by the time spent on each puzzle (10 minutes), yielding 3 * 10 = 30 minutes. Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles can be found by multiplying the number of puzzles (8) by the time spent on each puzzle (5 minutes), resulting in 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of these two values, which is 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the amount of water left after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters. This can be found by subtracting 90 from 120.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Next, we need to find the amount of rainwater collected, which is stated to be twice the amount left in the tank. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank to find the total amount of water now.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can simply add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

The number of geraniums is given as 90, and it's stated that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Therefore, the number of petunias can be calculated as 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of the initial expenditure.

The initial expenditure on advertising is $15,000. To find a third of this amount, we can divide it by 3:

$15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the initial expenditure to the second-year expenditure to find the total:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we can calculate the individual costs for Carlos and Benji and then sum them.

Carlos' cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the canoe (3 hours) by the hourly rate ($30). This yields a cost of $90.

Similarly, Benji's cost can be determined by multiplying the number of hours he used the banana boat raft (5 hours) by the hourly rate ($18), resulting in a cost of $90.

The total cost is the sum of these two individual costs, which is $90 + $90 = $180.

"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we must consider the time it takes for each leg of the journey. 

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, we can calculate the duration of the car trip as 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the days for each leg, which is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we must first calculate the total number of cards he possesses. 

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 water-type cards, he is left with 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards. Subsequently, he acquires 14 grass-type cards, bringing his total grass-type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards in James' collection is the sum of the individual card types: 30 (fire-type) + 34 (grass-type) + 32 (water-type) = 96 cards.

The probability of selecting a water-type card is then calculated as the ratio of water-type cards to the total number of cards, which is 32/96. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water-type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To determine the total cost of Chad's meal, we must calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Next, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Then, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Furthermore, adding the cost of 2 sauces, which is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. Finally, adding the upgrade for $3.00, the total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. 

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can calculate their combined rate of piece placement. 

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, and her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Therefore, their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we first need to calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. This can be found by taking 30% of the total number of watermelons produced.

Let's calculate 30% of 120:

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

This means that 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn's initial harvest. We can do this by subtracting the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total:

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons, which were ready for harvest after two weeks. To do this, we multiply the remaining watermelons by 3/4:

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons:

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we must consider the initial purchase price, the tax, and the registration fees.

The initial cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the cost per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total cost of the cars by this rate: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we must add the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car, to the total cost: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of these three components: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can start by establishing the number of shells she collects on Monday. Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate her Monday collection as 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

Next, we are informed that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore, we can calculate her Tuesday collection by multiplying her Monday collection by 2, yielding 2 * 25 = 50 shells.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the information provided to calculate the number of bugs and then add it to the number of ants. 

Given that there are half as many bugs as ants, we can establish a direct relationship between the two. If the number of ants is 50, then the number of bugs would be 50 divided by 2, which equals 25.

Now, we can calculate the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and bugs. 

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. Since one-third of the penguins jumped into the ocean and another one-third went inside the cave, we can calculate the total number of penguins that left by adding these two groups.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped into the ocean. Similarly, one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines required to meet Steve's tomato needs, we must first establish the total weekly consumption of tomatoes. Since Steve consumes twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, the total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day. 

Multiplying this by 7 days in a week yields a total weekly consumption of 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines required, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production per vine: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato requirements.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can employ a straightforward division approach. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions and John wants to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we then divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza, which is 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to meet his requirements.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing ink from empty pens to create new full pens. Since Ram can create one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can calculate the total number of full pens he can produce from 25 pens.

Let's divide the total number of pens (25) by the number of empty pens required to create one full pen (5):

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This calculation indicates that Ram can create 5 full pens from the initial 25 pens. As all the pens will be used to make the new pens, there will be no empty pens left. Therefore, Ram will have a total of 5 full pens.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the initial total amount of money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his allowance. This can be done by adding $20 (his allowance) and $10 (the extra amount), resulting in a total of $30.

Next, we need to account for the fact that the money tripled in value over the course of the year. To do this, we multiply the initial total amount by 3, which gives us $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can utilize the given information to establish a linear relationship between their ages. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as O, and Mary's age as M.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can express Joan's age as O = J + 5 and Mary's age as M = O - 2. Substituting the value of J into the equation for O, we get O = 20 + 5 = 25. Then, substituting the value of O into the equation for M, we get M = 25 - 2 = 23.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages: J + O + M = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is 68."
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we must first calculate the number of students who departed through exit A. 

Given that 30% of the initial 1000 students exited through A, we can calculate this as 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

The remaining students after this exit are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, we find the number of students who exited through B, which is 3/5 of the remaining 700 students. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, to determine the number of students who exited through C, we subtract the students who exited through B from the remaining students: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of candies each person has. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as N.

We are given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can express this as N = 2R.

Additionally, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, which can be written as J = R + 6.

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute N = 54 into the equation N = 2R to find the value of R.

54 = 2R
R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by substituting R into the equation J = R + 6.

J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we must consider the books each individual possesses and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly possesses 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's possession, in addition to her own. This results in a total of 2 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Dolly's books from Pandora) = 4 books read by Dolly.

Pandora possesses 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's possession, in addition to her own. This results in a total of 1 (Pandora's book) + 1 (Pandora's book from Dolly) = 2 books read by Pandora.

The collective total of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we must first calculate the total number of letters exchanged between Mike and his penpals. Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, the total number of letters exchanged is 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters written per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week can be calculated by multiplying the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60: 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we must first calculate the total minutes he has utilized. 

Jason's daily call with his boss consists of 15 minutes, and he has this call 30 times in a month. Therefore, the total minutes used for this call is 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

In addition to this, Jason has utilized an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. Thus, the total minutes used is 450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. 

Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy then took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. After this, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

We can express the number of fries Griffin had after Ginger gave him x fries as 9 + x. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Therefore, the equation representing the situation after Ginger gave Griffin x fries is 9 + x - 2 = 27.

Simplifying the equation, we get 7 + x = 27. Solving for x, we find that x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is equal to twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total amount paid by the makeup artist, we must first calculate the total hours worked. The artist works 6 hours per day, 4 days a week, which equates to 24 hours per week. Since the movie production spans 5 weeks, the total hours worked can be calculated as follows:

Total hours worked = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly rate of $250:

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

To find the amount of the discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost before the discount:

Discount = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to determine the total amount paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before discount - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The total weight of the onions is found by multiplying the number of bags by the weight per bag, which yields 4 * 50 = 200 pounds. 

Since the cost is given on a per-pound basis, we can then multiply the total weight by the cost per pound to obtain the total cost. Therefore, 200 pounds * $1.50 per pound results in a total cost of $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Now, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and the total calories consumed by her sister is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes. 

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

Since the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we must consider the changes in the number of apps. Initially, Travis had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, which reduces the total to 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Following this, he downloaded 18 more apps, increasing the total to 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two separate equations based on the given conditions.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W and the number of cougars killed last night as C. We are given that W = 10 and C = 15.

From the information provided, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is 3C = 3 * 15 = 45.

Additionally, we are told that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than last night, so the number of cougars killed today is C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today:

Total number of wolves killed = W + 45 = 10 + 45 = 55
Total number of cougars killed = C + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 55 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is currently on, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. We start with his initial floor, which is 3, and multiply it by 4, then add 6.

This can be represented as 3 * 4 + 6. 

First, we multiply 3 by 4, which equals 12. Then, we add 6 to 12, resulting in 18.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can start by calculating the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can find 30% of Mitchel's total and subtract it from Mitchel's total.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Therefore, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find Robert's total, we can multiply Anne's total by 4.

Robert's total = 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"

The initial number of cows in each stall is 20. When 40 new cows are added and distributed evenly, the number of cows per stall becomes 20 + 40/20 = 6.

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
6 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 48 cows.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we must calculate the value of each type of currency and sum them together.

First, we calculate the value of the pennies: 100 pennies equal 100 cents, which is equivalent to $1. 

Next, we calculate the value of the nickels: 40 nickels equal 40 cents, which is equivalent to $0.40.

Then, we calculate the value of the dimes: 20 dimes equal 20 cents, which is equivalent to $0.20.

Lastly, we calculate the value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills equal $40.

Now, we add the values together: $1 + $0.40 + $0.20 + $40 = $41.60.

Therefore, Brady has $41.60 in his piggy bank.

"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we must first calculate the number of 10-foot sections that comprise the tree. Given that the tree is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

However, the termites have consumed 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood that was eaten, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of apples and bananas each person has. Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has is x + 8.

We are also given that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Therefore, the number of bananas Andrea has is x/2. Additionally, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is x + 4.

We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation x + 8 = 52 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 44.

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find the number of bananas he has by adding 4: 44 + 4 = 48.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, we can find the number of bananas she has by dividing 48 by 2: 48 / 2 = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have: Andrea's total = 52 + 24 = 76, and Jamal's total = 44 + 48 = 92. Therefore, the total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she plans to bake. This can be done by adding the number of cookies she will bake today to the number of cookies she will bake tomorrow.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12 and then multiplying by 2.

Total flour needed = (66 cookies / 12) * 2 cups
= 5.5 * 2 cups
= 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of pennies by the fraction 2/3. 

The calculation is as follows: (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can then multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny to obtain the total dollar amount.

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. We start by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, which yields 5 * 50 = 250. Then, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to this total, resulting in 250 + 20 = 270.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H. We are given the following information:

1. C = 6
2. F = C / 2
3. H = 2F + 5

Substituting the value of C into the equation for F, we get:
F = 6 / 2 = 3

Now, substituting the value of F into the equation for H, we get:
H = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:
H - F = 11 - 3 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can utilize the concept of linear relationships. Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as C, Samantha has as S, and Daisy has as D.

Given that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, we can express this relationship as S = C + 25. Additionally, since Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, we can express this relationship as D = S + 50.

We are also given that Carmen has $100. Substituting this value into the equation S = C + 25, we can solve for S: S = $100 + $25 = $125.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equation D = S + 50 to find the amount of money Daisy has: D = $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money the girls have, we can add up the amounts: C + S + D = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To determine the total price of the house, we must calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Adding this to the selling price of $350,000 gives a total price of $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price. This can be found by multiplying the selling price by 0.03: 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This can be found by multiplying the selling price by 0.05: 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000. The total amount paid is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find the net proceeds: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To determine the total time elapsed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we must consider the time required for the oil to reach the desired temperature and the time needed to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the additional time it takes for the oil to reach 400 degrees, which is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. This can be found by multiplying 20 minutes by 0.4, resulting in 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the 5 minutes less time it takes to cook the chicken compared to heating the oil. This means the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we sum the time required to heat the oil and the time needed to cook the chicken to obtain the total elapsed time. Therefore, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on all ads, we need to calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then add them together.

The cost of newspaper ads can be found by multiplying the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50). This gives us a total of $250.

Similarly, the cost of television ads can be found by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15), resulting in a total of $1125.

"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the information provided. 

First, we establish that the juggler can juggle a total of 16 balls. Since half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows: 16 / 2 = 8.

Next, we're informed that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the total number of golf balls by 2: 8 / 2 = 4.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we must first calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them together.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag, however, has a hole, resulting in it having half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. Therefore, the third bag contains 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we can calculate the total number of M&Ms by adding the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary obtained is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows, we can break down the problem into two components: the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, we can find the total number of bedroom windows by multiplying the number of bedrooms per house by the number of bedrooms per house and then by the number of windows per bedroom. This gives us:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Each house has 4 additional windows, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to find the overall total:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change the cashier gives the mother, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items.

The total cost is calculated as follows:

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

Now, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid:

$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

Therefore, the cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we must first calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. Therefore, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we can calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet, which equals $800. 

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet, which equals $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is the sum of these two amounts, $800 + $2400, resulting in a total cost of $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each part.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which results in 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines belong to Sean, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, giving it a total of 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which equates to 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the total 80 cards have the letter A, we can find this by multiplying 2/5 by 80:

(2/5) * 80 = (2 * 80) / 5 = 160 / 5 = 32

Next, we subtract the number of cards with the letter A from the total to find the remaining cards:

80 - 32 = 48

Now, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards have the letter B, we can find this by multiplying 1/2 by 48:

(1/2) * 48 = 48 / 2 = 24

Subtracting the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards gives us:

48 - 24 = 24

Finally, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards have the letter C, we can find this by multiplying 5/8 by 24:

(5/8) * 24 = (5 * 24) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards:

24 - 15 = 9

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time required for each type of hole and then summing the results.

Let's denote the number of small holes as 's' and the number of large holes as 'l'. We are given that it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. Therefore, the total time can be expressed as:

Total time = 3s + 10l

We are given that Matthew needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

Total time = 3(30) + 10(15)
Total time = 90 + 150
Total time = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total time by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total time (in hours) = 240 / 60
Total time (in hours) = 4

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by establishing the current sum of their ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We are given that M + C = 20.

When we consider their ages in 10 years, we can express Mico's age as M + 10 and Marco's age as C + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years can be calculated as (M + 10) + (C + 10).

By substituting M + C = 20 into the equation, we get (M + 10) + (C + 10) = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

The first piece of information states that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can represent this as:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 results in:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is 6."

"To determine the total number of spots, we first need to establish the number of spots on each species. Given that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2, yielding 35 spots per mamba.

With 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park, we can calculate the total number of spots as follows:

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total by 2:
Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total cost of pizzas, we must first calculate the total number of individuals attending the event. This can be achieved by summing the number of team members, coaches, and their respective guests.

The number of team members is given as 12, while the number of coaches is 3. Furthermore, each team member brings 2 guests, resulting in a total of 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Therefore, the total number of individuals is 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of individuals by 3. This yields 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Given that each pizza costs $15, the total cost of pizzas can be calculated as 13 * $15 = $195.

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since each gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads used, we can divide the length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is 68."
"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to consider the number of stories each child wrote in the first week and then double that amount for the second week.

Let's start by calculating the number of stories each child wrote in the second week. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories. Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories. Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks. Alani's total is 20 + 40 = 60 stories. Braylen's total is 40 + 80 = 120 stories. Margot's total is 60 + 120 = 180 stories.

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.

Current age of the brother = 9 * 2 = 18 years

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

Age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

Therefore, the brother will be 21 years old in 3 years."
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop, we must first calculate the total amount of money she possesses. This can be achieved by adding the value of her quarters and dimes. 

The value of her quarters is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents, and the value of her dimes is 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents. Therefore, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has. This can be calculated as 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after purchasing the can of pop.

"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars on the flag. 

The flag consists of three rows of 8 stars, contributing a total of 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Additionally, there are two rows of 6 stars, adding 2 * 6 = 12 stars to the total. 

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. Given that the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 

40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks have a limited capacity, we must divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed. 

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we must first establish the speed of the vehicle in the slow lane. Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as follows:

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Next, we can utilize the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We are given that A = 22 and I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

We are also given that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. If we let the total number of medals given out be x, we can set up the equation:

A + I = 10x

Substituting the values of A and I, we get:

22 + 17 = 10x

Combine like terms:

39 = 10x

To solve for x, divide both sides by 10:

x = 39 / 10

x = 3.9

Since the number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as the problem does not specify that the number of medals given out must be a whole number. However, in this case, we can provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars distributed to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars, which are 40 - 24 = 16, are to be shared equally among the children. With 8 children, each child will receive 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine Susan's total earnings, we must first calculate the total minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes by multiplying the hours worked by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. This yields 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

However, Susan pauses for half an hour, so we must subtract this time from the total minutes she works. 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Given that Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work, we can calculate her earnings by dividing the total minutes worked by 10 and then multiplying by her hourly wage. 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals. Then, 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we first need to establish their initial point totals. 

Given that Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, we can calculate their initial point totals as follows:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, all players receive an additional point if they have more than 20 points. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will each receive an additional point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we can calculate the total points of all three players by adding their individual totals:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"

The sum of the oranges washed by the sons is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Given that Will initially purchased 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges can be calculated as follows:

Unwashed oranges = Total oranges - Oranges washed
= 15 - 12
= 3

Therefore, there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has completed over the two days, we must first calculate the number of each activity performed on each day and then sum the results.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, reduced his squats by 10, and doubled his dumbbell presses.

The number of pushups on the second day is 100 + 20 = 120. The number of squats on the second day is 50 - 10 = 40. The number of dumbbell presses on the second day is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total count of each activity over the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of these values: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration for which a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we must first calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household per week. 

Each individual consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are two meals per day. Therefore, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg. With five members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are seven days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

To find the number of weeks the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg):

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam fell short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates he sold. This can be achieved by summing the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then adding the crates sold over the weekend.

The total number of crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates. Adding the 20 crates sold over the weekend yields a total of 45 + 20 = 65 crates.

To find the difference between the target and the actual number of crates sold, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam fell 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can analyze the bidding process step by step. The bids on the desk increase by $50 each time, and there were three other individuals who made a bid. 

The sequence of bids can be represented as follows: $200, $250, $300, and $350. Since Carmen bids after each of the other three individuals, her bids are also $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350, so we need to add the cost of the desk to this amount. However, we must also consider the bids made by the other three individuals. 

The total cost of the bids made by the other three people is $150 ($50 + $50 + $50). 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the desk by adding the cost of the final bid, the cost of the bids made by the other three people, and Carmen's last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $150 (bids by others) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $800

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of John's driving service, we need to consider both the mileage-based charge and the monthly bonus.

First, we calculate the total miles driven in a year. Since John commutes to work and back, the daily round-trip distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the weekly mileage is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. Multiplying this by the number of weeks worked in a year (50 weeks), we get the total miles driven in a year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving is calculated by multiplying the total miles driven by the cost per mile, which is $2. Therefore, the total driving cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

In addition to the driving cost, John receives a monthly bonus of $150. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

The total cost of John's driving service is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he spent exercising on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes, and on Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. The combined time is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter aims to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can calculate this by multiplying the combined time by 2.

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the configuration of the pages. 

When a tabloid is folded in half, it creates two sides: left and right. Each side consists of 16 pages. However, the pages are arranged in a specific pattern: 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back of each side.

Considering this configuration, we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper required. 

Since each side has 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back, we need 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of paper for each side. As there are two sides, the total number of pieces of paper required is 16 + 16 = 32.

Therefore, a 32-page tabloid requires 32 pieces of paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Annika initially brought $50. She then spent $25 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount:

$50 - $25 - $10 = $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can start by establishing the number of books sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year as 2 * 45 = 90.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Given that 90 books were sold in the first year, the number of books sold in the second year can be found by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books sold in the first two years: 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we must consider both his hourly wage and the bonus he receives. 

Watson's hourly wage is $10, and he works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week. This results in a daily income of $10 * 10 = $100. Since there are 4 weeks in April, his total daily income for the month is $100 * 4 = $400. 

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the month, as the company performed well. Therefore, his total earnings for April are $400 + $300 = $700.

The final answer is: $700."
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate the percentage of people he lost to by multiplying the total number of people he wrestled (20) by the percentage of people he lost to (0.8).

20 * 0.8 = 16

Therefore, John lost to 16 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. Since two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning, we can calculate this as follows:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

The remaining loaves are then 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as follows:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can first calculate Joey's weekly weight loss rate. 

Given that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can find his weekly weight loss rate by dividing the total weight lost by the number of weeks. 

Weight loss rate = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the total weight lost by Sandy in 4 weeks. 

Total weight lost by Sandy = Weight loss rate * Number of weeks
Total weight lost by Sandy = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost by Sandy = 8 pounds

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2. Therefore, the total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2. Thus, the total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated by subtracting the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs the person will grow after administering the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, we can analyze the growth pattern. The serum causes the person to grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days.

We can represent the number of extra arms and legs as a sequence of integers, where the first term is 0 (initially, the person has no extra limbs) and the common difference for arms is 1/3 (since an arm is added every 3 days) and for legs is 1/5 (since a leg is added every 5 days).

The number of extra arms after 15 days can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term (0), n is the number of terms (15), and d is the common difference (1/3).

a_15 = 0 + (15-1)(1/3) = 0 + 14(1/3) = 14/3

The number of extra legs after 15 days can be calculated using the same formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term (0), n is the number of terms (15), and d is the common difference (1/5).

a_15 = 0 + (15-1)(1/5) = 0 + 14(1/5) = 14/5

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs: 14/3 + 14/5.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. We can rewrite the fractions as:

14/3 = (14*5)/(3*5) = 70/15
14/5 = (14*3)/(5*3) = 42/15

Now we can add the fractions: 70/15 + 42/15 = 112/15

Since 112/15 is approximately 7.47, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a limb. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact fraction.

The total number of new limbs is 112/15.

Final answer: $\boxed{\frac{112}{15}}$"
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

The cost of 6 business suits can be calculated as 6 * $100 = $600. Additionally, the cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Furthermore, the cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500, resulting in a total of $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of the items purchased is the sum of these amounts: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, we subtract this total from Theo's initial budget of $6000 to find the remaining amount available for gifts: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wishes to save $2000, we subtract this amount from the remaining funds: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo needs to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs consumed by the three individuals who eat three eggs per day and the number of eggs consumed by the two individuals who eat two eggs per day.

Let's denote the number of eggs consumed by the three individuals as 3x and the number of eggs consumed by the two individuals as 2y. Since there are 5 family members in total, we can set up the equation 3x + 2y = 5, as the total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 5.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to multiply the total number of eggs consumed per day by 7. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 7(3x + 2y).

Since we know that 3x + 2y = 5, we can substitute this value into the expression 7(3x + 2y) to get 7(5) = 35.

Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can utilize the given information in a logical sequence. 

First, we establish Quinn's age as the reference point, which is 30 years. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27 years. 

Next, we apply the same logic to find Trent's age, as he is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age can be calculated as 27 + 5 = 32 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera. Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This can be expressed as:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

Substituting C = 46 into the equation, we get:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can calculate the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can express this relationship as:

P = 3000N
P = 3000(26)
P = 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile as:

P_now = 2P
P_now = 2(78000)
P_now = 156000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 156,000.

The final answer is: 156000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people who attended Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, resulting in 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, yielding 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is the sum of these two groups: 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness, so we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who were unable to attend had prior commitments. This equates to 8 / 4 = 2 people. We then subtract these individuals from the total number of people who were initially expected to attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people attended Martha's party."
"To determine the total weight of marbles, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Solomon initially acquired 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and subsequently received 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. 

The number of marbles his father gave him is 2/5 * 20 = 8. 

Adding these to the initial 20 marbles, we obtain a total of 20 + 8 = 28 marbles. 

The store already possessed 50 marbles. 

Therefore, the total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the pool, is given by the product of its length, width, and height.

Given that the pool's dimensions are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in height, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume (V) = Length (L) * Width (W) * Height (H)
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Next, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1. This will provide us with the total cost to fill the pool.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can start by establishing the number of boys, which is given as 30. 

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3. This yields 3 * 30 = 90 girls.

Additionally, the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10, resulting in 1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered children.

Now, we can calculate the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of ratios. The given ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This implies that for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is needed. 

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can calculate the number of sets of 3 electric wires by dividing 45 by 3.

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since each set of 3 electric wires necessitates 1 electric pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we first need to calculate the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we know that 22 men stayed, we can find the total number of people who left by using the information about the men.

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' left, and 22 men stayed. Since 3 men left, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = (1/4) * 12 = 3

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the costs of the magazine, book, and pen.

Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M, the cost of the book as B, and the cost of the pen as P. We are given the following information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book: M = B/2
2. The book costs $4: B = $4
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine: P = M - $1

Substituting the value of B into the first equation, we get:
M = $4/2
M = $2

Now, we can find the cost of the pen by substituting the value of M into the third equation:
P = M - $1
P = $2 - $1
P = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"To determine the total number of boxes required to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils. We are given that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Additionally, her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We are also given that Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is the sum of Jam's pencils and Meg's pencils, which is (3x + 2) + 46.

Since we know the total number of pencils is 120, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 + 46 = 120

Combine like terms:

3x + 48 = 120

Subtract 48 from both sides:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box is 24, we can calculate the total number of boxes required. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, and each box can hold 24 pencils, the total number of boxes required is 3.

However, we also need to consider the 2 loose pencils. Since 2 pencils are already included in the 3 boxes, we don't need to add any additional boxes for the loose pencils.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the combined effects of cooling and added liquid.

Let's begin by analyzing the cooling effect. The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find the number of ice cubes used, we can divide the total cooling degree by the cooling effect per ice cube: 65 / 13 = 5. Therefore, 5 ice cubes were used.

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so the total weakening due to cooling is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, we consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This addition also weakens the coffee, and we can directly add this value to the total weakening: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a straightforward perspective. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, we can establish a ratio of old records to new records. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded by multiplying the number of new records by 2, as each new record is obtained by trading 2 old records.

Total new records = 7
Total old records traded = 7 * 2 = 14

Since 5 people are involved in the trade, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Total old records traded / 5
= 14 / 5
= 2.8

However, since we cannot trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot trade a fraction of a record. 

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 2 old records each.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers, which is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Next, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the salary of senior programmers is:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, we can calculate the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers separately:

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total salaries of junior and senior programmers:

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who initially boarded the bus as 'x'. 

We know that 5 people boarded at the first stop and 8 more boarded at the second stop. However, 7 people disembarked at the second stop. The total number of people heading to the third stop is given as 20. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we find: x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can analyze the sequence of events that affect his lollipop supply.

Initially, Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that alter his lollipop count. 

First, he consumes 2 lollipops on his way to school, reducing his supply to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. 

Next, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in a decrease of 14 lollipops, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Subsequently, Oscar purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave away, which equates to 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Consequently, his lollipop count increases to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Following this, he consumes 3 lollipops that night, reducing his supply to 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Lastly, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in a final count of 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The rate of charge is 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find the time required to charge 40%, we can set up a proportion:

1% / 3 minutes = 40% / x minutes

Solving for x, we get:

x = (40% * 3 minutes) / 1%
x = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother presents her with an additional 10 lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Following this, Erin relinquishes 3 lollipops to Ella, which leaves her with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"To determine the amount the customer paid, we must first calculate the total rewards they received. Given that the customer's loyalty card offers $1 off for every $20 spent, and they spent $80, we can calculate the rewards as follows:

Rewards = Total Spent / 20
Rewards = $80 / 20
Rewards = 4

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the actual rewards they received is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 
Amount Paid = Total Spent - Rewards
Amount Paid = $80 - $8
Amount Paid = $72

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must first calculate the annual income for each option and then account for the respective taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B provides a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate 40% of the total number of castles. 

40% of 220 castles is equivalent to 0.4 * 220 = 88. 

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we then divide this number by 2. 

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each option.

For Furniture United's offer, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers can be found by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

$3,450 - $3,350 = $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we must first calculate the total number of guns. This can be achieved by summing the individual gun collections of Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ.

The total number of guns is the sum of their individual collections: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

Since there are four individuals, we then divide the total number of guns by 4 to determine the number each person would receive.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for each type of confectionery item separately and then sum the results.

For suckers, we multiply the number of batches by the ounces per batch: 8 batches * 30 ounces/batch = 240 ounces.

For fudge, we multiply the number of batches by the ounces per batch: 1 batch * 70 ounces/batch = 70 ounces.

The total amount of sugar required is the sum of these two quantities: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of percentage change to the initial investment. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price after the first year. A 50% increase means the new price is 150% of the original price, or 1.5 times the original price. Therefore, the value of each share after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the stock price after the second year. A 25% decrease means the new price is 75% of the price after the first year, or 0.75 times $12. Therefore, the value of each share after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we must first establish the quantity consumed by each individual. 

We are given that Luke consumed 2 hot dogs. Since Thomas consumed three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can calculate Thomas's consumption as 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Given that John consumed half the amount Thomas ate, we can calculate John's consumption as 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in their consumption, we subtract Luke's consumption from John's consumption: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of students in the smallest group. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as an equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To determine the total number of legs on the farm, we can approach the problem by first establishing the relationship between the number of chickens and cows. Let's denote the number of cows as x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens can be represented as 2x.

Given that the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 20

This indicates that there are 20 cows on the farm. Consequently, the number of chickens is 2x = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has and adding them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs on the farm is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has when he starts juggling on stage, we can analyze the pattern of his juggling progression. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls at the end of each week can be calculated as follows:

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught, he loses 1 ball. Therefore, the number of balls he has when he starts juggling on stage is 6 - 1 = 5 balls.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we must first establish the weight of each animal. 

Given that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, and the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can conclude that the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog and the green toad weigh the same, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds. 

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. 

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, minus the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower, which is twice the amount given by her friend. This equates to 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. 

Next, we add the outfits gifted by her mom, which amounts to 15 outfits. 

The total number of outfits can be found by summing these values: 24 (from her friend) + 48 (from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 outfits.

Therefore, Laurel has a total of 87 baby outfits for her child."
"To determine the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we must first calculate the increased daily distance. The coach's recommendation is to increase the daily distance by 1/5 of the original 5000 meters. This can be calculated as 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters. Therefore, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June can be found by multiplying the new daily distance by the number of days: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can start by establishing the prices of each juice box. 

Given that Juice Box A costs $4, we can calculate the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C. Since Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, its price is $4 + $5 = $9. Similarly, Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of legs in the restaurant, we can calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

Let's denote the number of tables with 4 legs as 'a' and the number of tables with 3 legs as 'b'. We are given that a = 40 and b = 50.

The total number of legs can be represented as 4a + 3b. Substituting the given values, we get:

Total number of legs = 4(40) + 3(50)
= 160 + 150
= 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband. Her son consumes 4 cookies per day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband consumes 1 cookie per day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The combined total of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price of the shirts.

The original price of one shirt is $30. A 40% discount on this price can be calculated as 0.4 * $30 = $12. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt: $30 - $12 = $18. 

Since Davos purchased two shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2: $18 * 2 = $36.

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the two shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we first need to calculate the revenue generated from tractors and silos separately.

The factory previously sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. In contrast, they now sell 5 silos at $220 each, yielding a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The total daily revenue has increased from $1000 to $1100, resulting in a difference of $100. To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure. 

The monthly cost of food is $25 per week, and since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Additionally, the monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100. 

The total monthly expenditure is the sum of these costs: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 per year on her dog.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we must first calculate the duration of each scheduled event.

The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, which lasts one hour. Therefore, the cooking class on Tuesday lasts 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is 0.5 hours.

The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the museum tour on Thursday lasts 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Peyton's errands on Friday last for two hours.

Now, we can calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities by adding the durations of each event: 1 (yoga) + 3 (cooking) + 0.5 (cheese-tasting) + 1.5 (museum tour) + 2 (errands) = 7.5 hours.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we first need to calculate the total number of pots required for the daisies and roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can express this as 2x, where x represents the number of pots needed for the daisies. Therefore, the total number of pots required is 30 (for daisies) + 2x (for roses).

We are given that the total number of pots required is 90. Setting up the equation 30 + 2x = 90, we can solve for x:

30 + 2x = 90
2x = 60
x = 30

This means April needs 30 pots for the daisies and 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses. 

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - (30 + 60) = 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. We start with the initial amount she had, which is $36. Then, we need to account for the expenses incurred, which include the $11 spent on a sweater and the $4 given to her brother.

The total amount spent is the sum of these two expenses, which is $11 + $4 = $15. To find the amount saved, we subtract this total from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity. 

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as x. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, for a total of 6 hours. These activities account for 30% of his total time.

We can express this as an equation: 0.3x = 15.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we can calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle's earnings from her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, can be calculated as 20 hours * $10/hour = $200. Her earnings from her second job, where she earns $5 per hour, can be calculated as 15 hours * $5/hour = $75. The sum of these earnings is $200 + $75 = $275.

Adding her initial savings of $80 to this total, we get $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can start by establishing the heights of the two shorter trees. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as x. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, its height can be represented as x + 5.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is x + (x + 5) = 2x + 5.

The problem states that the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree can be expressed as 2(2x + 5).

Simplifying the expression, we get 4x + 10.

Now, we know that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so x = 6. Substituting this value into the expression for the height of the tallest tree, we get 4(6) + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he purchased and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The cost of the toy cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of toy cars (6) by the cost per toy car ($2), resulting in a total cost of $12. Similarly, the cost of the teddy bears can be found by multiplying the number of teddy bears (5) by the cost per teddy bear ($1), yielding a total cost of $5. The combined cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After purchasing the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11. His mother then gave him an additional $10, bringing his new total to $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we must first calculate the total cost of the activities she desires. 

A round of mini-golf costs $5, and she wishes to participate in one round. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she intends to ride twice, resulting in a total cost of $20. Additionally, she desires $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Morgan's budget for the party is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will incur a cost of $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we must first calculate the total cost of lollipops she purchases over a 5-day period. 

The cost of each lollipop is $0.25, and she buys 4 lollipops daily. Therefore, the total daily expenditure on lollipops is 4 * $0.25 = $1. 

Since she saves the change, we need to find the difference between her daily pocket money and the total cost of lollipops. Her daily pocket money is $5, and the total cost of lollipops for 5 days is $1 * 5 = $5. 

The amount saved in the piggy bank is $5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Billy had initially. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, we can infer that he had $10 initially. This is because he spent $2 on gumballs, and the remaining half of his change is also $2.

Next, we can calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy. We know that he spent $2 on gumballs and $1.5 on candy, so the total amount spent on candy is $1.5. This means he had $10 - $1.5 - $2 = $6.5 left.

Now, we can calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he had left ($6.5) by the cost of candy per pound ($1.5). This gives us $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as the equation C = 2S - 5. Substituting C = 45 into this equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between train services, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a single trip. The train covers 75 miles from the first city to the second, 100 miles from the second city to the third, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first. 

The combined distance from the third city to the first city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train makes this trip three times a day, the total distance covered in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The final answer is 0.05."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we must first calculate the amount required for each type of dog bed. 

The Rottweiler bed necessitates 8 pounds of stuffing, while the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds. To find the average amount for the collie bed, we take the average of these two values: (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

With this information, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed. For the 4 chihuahua beds, Mark will require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For the 3 collie beds, he will need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

To find the total amount of stuffing required, we add these values together: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total time taken for the trip, we can break down the journey into its constituent parts and calculate the time taken for each segment.

The total distance traveled is 200 miles (to his friend's house) + 10 miles (detour) + 240 miles (back home) = 450 miles.

The time taken to cover the first 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph is given by:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

The time taken to cover the 10-mile detour at a speed of 70 mph is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

The time taken to cover the remaining 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

The total time taken for the entire trip is the sum of these three times:

Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

Therefore, the total time taken for the trip is 5.99 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. We know that the total number of students is 96, and 43 of them are girls. This implies that the remaining students are boys.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

However, we are also given that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boys as 'b' and the number of girls as 'g'. We are given that the number of girls is 6, so g = 6.

We are also told that there are twice as many boys as girls, which can be expressed as b = 2g. Substituting the value of g, we get b = 2(6) = 12.

Now, to find the total number of kids, we add the number of boys and girls: total_kids = b + g = 12 + 6 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can utilize a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total points she has already scored: 15 + 18 = 33. 

Next, we subtract this value from the total required points: 42 - 33 = 9.

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we can start by calculating the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons. 

Three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Then, a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This results in 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers being kicked out for shoplifting. 

Furthermore, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 customers. 

Now, we can find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons from the overall total. 

The total number of customers kicked out is 50. 

50 (total) - 3 (refusing to wear masks) - 7 (shoplifting) - 21 (physical violence) = 19

Therefore, 19 customers were kicked out for other reasons."
"To determine the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points, we can express this relationship as:

x + 14 = 3(x + 8)

This equation represents the fact that Erin's initial points (x) plus the 14 points she scored equals three times the points Sara had (3 times her initial points plus 24).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 3x + 24

Subtracting x from both sides:

14 = 2x + 24

Subtracting 24 from both sides:

-10 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

-5 = x

So, Erin had -5 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is -5."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the individual components involved. 

First, we calculate the cost of the picture frames. With 44 seniors receiving awards, each frame costs $20. Additionally, each frame requires an etching that adds 20% to the cost. The total cost for the frames is 44 * $20 = $880. The etching cost is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. Therefore, the total cost for the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

Next, we consider the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 each, resulting in a total of 2 * $5 = $10.

Furthermore, we need to account for the cords required for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer requires a cord at a cost of $12, leading to a total cost of 11 * $12 = $132.

To obtain the overall cost, we sum the individual costs: $884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026.

The final answer is: $1026"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we must first calculate the discount amount. The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400, and the DIY option saves 20% of this amount.

The discount can be calculated as 20% of $400, which is equivalent to 0.20 * $400 = $80.

To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we subtract the discount from the original cost:

Total cost for DIY = Original cost - Discount
Total cost for DIY = $400 - $80
Total cost for DIY = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can break down the sales for each day and account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the amount from Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount from Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the hours for each day and then sum them up.

Hallie's dance practice consists of 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, her practice lasts twice as long as her Tuesday class, which means it is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week can be calculated as follows:

Total hours = Tuesday hours + Thursday hours + Saturday hours
Total hours = 1 + 2 + 2
Total hours = 5

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we must first calculate the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as 'T' and the percentage of faulty pieces as 'p'. We are given that the total amount spent is $400,000 and p = 40%.

The number of faulty pieces can be calculated as p% of T, which is 0.4T. Since the total number of pieces is T, the number of functioning pieces is T - 0.4T = 0.6T.

We are given that the total amount spent is $400,000, which is equal to the sum of the amount spent on faulty pieces and the amount spent on functioning pieces. The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4T, and the amount spent on functioning pieces is 0.6T. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.4T + 0.6T = 400,000

Combine like terms:

1T = 400,000

Divide both sides by 1:

T = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces, we can calculate the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6T = 0.6 * 400,000 = 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is equal to the number of functioning pieces multiplied by the cost per piece. However, we are not given the cost per piece. Assuming the cost per piece is $1 (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise), the total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000 * $1 = $240,000

Final answer: $240,000"
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects daily, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the milk obtained from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. Since each of these sheep yields 1 kg of milk, the total milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

Next, we calculate the milk obtained from the other half of the sheep, which is also 15 sheep. Each of these sheep yields 2 kg of milk, so the total milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects daily is the sum of the milk from both halves, which is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we must consider the initial number of rolls and the subsequent division of the remaining rolls into smaller pieces.

Initially, Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls. After feeding 6 rolls to her children, she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. Since each of these remaining rolls was broken into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces can be calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size. This can be found by dividing the total number of pupils by 2: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of pupils who do not like blue by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue from the total class size: 40 - 20 = 20.

Then, we calculate the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils. This can be found by dividing the number of remaining pupils by 4: 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, we determine the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the number of pupils who do not like blue: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts.

First, we can calculate the number of apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and earned $56, we can divide the total earnings by the price per apple to find the number of apples sold on Monday. This gives us 56 / 4 = 14 apples.

Next, we are given that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. To find the number of apples picked on Wednesday, we are told that she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Given that there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed can be calculated as 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total count. Initially, Rachel had 23 cookies. She then received an additional 42 cookies from Janet, bringing the total to 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

However, her brother subsequently consumed 44 cookies, resulting in a decrease in the total count. To find the number of cookies remaining, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total: 65 - 44 = 21.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal (initial amount borrowed) = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12) = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments (months) = 5

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.008333^5)]/(1.008333^5 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.0457)]/(1.0457 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.0696]/0.0457
M ≈ 802.01

The monthly payment Karan has to make is approximately $802."
"To determine the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we can calculate the distance each of them covered by multiplying their respective speeds by the time they hiked.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

The difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe can be found by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we must first calculate the amount of silver and gold they possess individually.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Additionally, she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which results in 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The combined total of silver pesos is 50 + 100 = 150.
The combined total of gold pesos is 80 + 120 = 200.

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the profit per hour that Millie makes from running her lemonade stand, we first need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the product of the number of cups of lemonade sold and the price per cup. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she sells 3 pitchers, the total number of cups sold is 3 * 12 = 36 cups. Given that each cup is sold for $1, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is the amount spent on supplies, which is $18.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit by the number of hours spent running the lemonade stand. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours spent running the stand is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. This can be represented as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/5:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the total number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to establish the initial number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since the choir is performing with just the female members, the total number of people performing is solely comprised of these 26 girls. However, it is stated that half of the people performing cannot make it to the show due to a bus breakdown. To find the number of people who can perform, we divide the total number of girls by 2, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people performing is the sum of the girls (13) and the teachers (3), resulting in 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. This can be achieved by summing up all the scores and then dividing by the number of tests.

The sum of the scores is calculated as follows: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 5. 
400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is 80."
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can employ the principles of arithmetic. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the erasers by multiplying the number of erasers (6) by the cost of one eraser ($2), which yields $12. 

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils by multiplying the number of pencils (8) by the cost of one pencil ($3), resulting in $24.

Finally, we add the total cost of the erasers ($12) and the total cost of the pencils ($24) to obtain the overall cost. This gives us $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3. This is based on the given information that he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66 = 22

Total number of messages = 66 + 22 = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, David saves $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we must first calculate the total number of gifts she needs to wrap. This can be done by summing the number of gifts for her family, friends, and teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Next, we divide the total amount of ribbon available by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift. 

Total amount of ribbon = 144 inches

Now, we perform the division:
144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of popsicles each individual has, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim receives a 20% discount for bundling. To find the discounted cost, we calculate 20% of $10, which is $2. Therefore, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the percentage of time spent editing, we must first convert the recording time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

The total work time can be calculated by summing the individual times spent on each activity: writing, recording, and editing. 

Writing time: 4 hours
Recording time: 1.5 hours
Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:

(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the capacity of the shelving system. With 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Since Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we need to find double the capacity. This is calculated as 2 * 36 = 72 books.

To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we then add 20 more to the doubled capacity, resulting in 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now possesses, we must consider the initial number of cards she created, the cards she received from her father, and the cards she distributed to others.

Initially, Erica crafted 20 cards. Her father presented her with 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. Therefore, she acquired 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her father.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica possesses:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her father) = 50 cards

She distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

Therefore, Erica now possesses 21 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices given away. Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. She then gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, resulting in (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny initially had 12 slices and gave away 7, leaving her with 12 - 7 = 5 slices. However, she also consumed 2 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use the concept of simple interest. The formula for simple interest is:

Time = Total Amount / Daily Earnings

In this case, the total amount Mark needs is $300, and his daily earnings are $10. Plugging in these values, we get:

Time = $300 / $10
Time = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of bugs, we must first calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 the number of spiders, which is 1/3 * 90 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

The total number of bugs is the sum of the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can start by establishing the age of each individual. 

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age by adding 5 years to Erica's age, resulting in Beth being 35 years old. 

Next, we can find Alice's age by adding 7 years to Beth's age, yielding Alice's age as 42 years.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age, which gives us 42 - 30 = 12 years.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To determine the total calories consumed, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we multiply the number of glasses by the ounces per glass to obtain the total ounces consumed. This yields 2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces.

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we must first calculate the total number of working days in a year. Given that the builder works 4 weeks per month and 6 days per week, we can calculate the total number of working days in a year as follows:

First, we multiply the number of weeks worked per month (4) by the number of weeks in a year (52), which yields 4 * 52 = 208 weeks. 

Since the builder works 6 days per week, we then multiply the total number of weeks worked in a year (208) by the number of working days per week (6), resulting in 208 * 6 = 1248 working days.

Finally, we multiply the total number of working days in a year (1248) by the daily wage ($50) to obtain the builder's annual earnings: 1248 * 50 = $62400.

The final answer is $62400."
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. To make a quadruple batch, we multiply these quantities by 4. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

"To calculate the energy saved, we first need to determine the total energy usage in 30 days at the original rate. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day. Therefore, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh).

The total energy usage in 30 days is then 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh.

Next, we calculate the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours. The new usage is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

To convert Wh to kWh, we divide by 1000: 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

Therefore, the energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4050}$"
"To determine the average number of stripes on the zebras, we must first calculate the total number of stripes. The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so their combined total is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras in total, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we must first calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total number of sandwiches needed as follows:

Total people / people per sandwich = 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To determine the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between the two. It is given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, we can express the number of corns as 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we are informed that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, bringing the total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. However, it is also stated that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Therefore, the number of corns can be calculated as 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis by adding the two quantities together: 60 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we must first calculate the total steps he completed prior to the jog. Since he finished half of his 10,000-step goal on his walks to and from school, we can calculate this as 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

Additionally, he completed an extra 1,000 steps during a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps remaining to reach his goal. To find the number of steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To determine the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we can calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long, with an average of 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. To find the time it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Considering that Toby needs to arrive at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, we can calculate the time he will arrive at the airport. Since he will finish the book 30 minutes before the deadline, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport, he will arrive 30 - 10 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. The total amount paid in May can be calculated as:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, resulting in 3/4 of the original 40 employees remaining. This equates to 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June, which is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy was on sale, offering a ""buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This implies that the second pound is discounted by 50% of its original price. Therefore, the price of the second pound is $3 - ($3/2) = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally also purchased a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of all items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally initially had $10. After subtracting the total cost of the items, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total amount spent by Tim, we must first calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The combined cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we need to calculate the discount on the two packages. The discount is 20% of $1200, which can be calculated as 0.20 x $1200 = $240. Therefore, the cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can calculate the total number of cookies required for 30 days. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night, the total number of cookies needed for 30 days is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Given that her recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of dozens needed by dividing the total number of cookies required by 12.

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies per dozen = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we must consider the intersection of the two events. We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we are also told that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. However, we are not provided with information about the percentage of candles that explode.

Let's assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, as there is no other information to suggest otherwise. 

We can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as 5% of 50,000:

0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500

Therefore, 2,500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2500}$"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can calculate the discount amount for each blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses purchased.

The discount per blouse is 30% of the regular price of $20. This can be calculated as:

Discount per blouse = 0.30 * $20
= $6

The discounted price per blouse is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the regular price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha purchases 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14
= $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing variables for the number of apples gathered from each type of tree. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. Additionally, we know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which means her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Furthermore, we are informed that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We can express the total number of apples gathered by both sisters as the sum of the apples gathered from each type of tree: T + S + A = 500.

Substituting the known values, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combining like terms, we have:

120 + A = 500

Subtracting 120 from both sides yields:

A = 380

Therefore, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Given that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2c + d. We are also provided with the information that the total number of heads is 180, which can be expressed as c + d = 180.

Furthermore, the total number of bumps is given as 304, so we can write the equation 2c + d = 304.

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we can eliminate 'd' and solve for 'c':

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we have found 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down his journey into distinct segments.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day, resulting in a total of 800 kilometers. Over the subsequent 2 days, he covered 30% of the distance he had traveled in the initial 4 days. This equates to 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. Consequently, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, Tom did not travel, so the distance for this day is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day, which amounts to 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is the sum of the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week, which is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can start by establishing the relationship between the locker sizes of Peter, Zack, and Timothy. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.

Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P. We can express the given information as the following equations:

P = 1/4Z
Z = 1/2T

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so P = 5. Substituting this value into the first equation, we can solve for Z:

5 = 1/4Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for T:

Z = 1/2T
20 = 1/2T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we must first calculate the elevation of the comb. This can be achieved by adding the elevation of Stanley to the distance the comb fell.

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Elevation of Stanley + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Next, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine the vertical distance Oliver must climb. This can be calculated as follows:

Difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Elevation of Oliver
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11,000}$"
"To determine the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

We are given that he initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank provided $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $8000. 

To find the total capital, we add the initial amount to the amounts received from the two banks: $5000 + $4000 + $8000. 

This calculation yields a total capital of $14000."
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of cats carried away by the boats. Since each boat carried 5 cats and there were 4 boats, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

Next, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Then, we find 3/5 of the remaining cats, which is 30 * 3/5 = 18. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply 30 by 3/5.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break down the subscription into three distinct periods. 

The initial 6 months are charged at $8 per month, resulting in a total of $8 * 6 = $48. 

The next 8 months are charged at the normal rate of $12 per month, yielding a total of $12 * 8 = $96. 

The final 8 months are charged at the increased rate of $14 per month, resulting in a total of $14 * 8 = $112.

Adding these amounts together, we obtain $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To determine the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we can start by establishing the variables for the prices of each pair of jeans. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x and the original price of the tattered jeans as x + 6, since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

Given that Cole saved a total of $6, we can express the amount saved from each pair of jeans as fractions of the total savings. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. The remaining 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans, which can be expressed as 2/3 * (x + 6).

We can set up the equation to represent the total savings:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To simplify the equation, we can first distribute the 2/3 to the terms within the parentheses:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combining like terms, we get:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides yields:

x = 2

Now that we have found the original price of the jogger jeans, we can determine the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees. 

The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder as B and the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder as H. We are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so we can express this as H = B + 10.

We also know that Lillian built 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3B, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3H.

Since the total number of birds is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders, we can set up the equation: 3B + 3H = Total birds.

Substituting H = B + 10 into the equation, we get: 3B + 3(B + 10) = Total birds.

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 3B + 3B + 30 = Total birds, which simplifies to 6B + 30 = Total birds.

We are also given that each type of feeder attracts 20 birds. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, we can set up the equation: 3(20) = 60.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for B by substituting 60 for 3B in the equation 6B + 30 = Total birds, which gives us: 6(20) + 30 = Total birds.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 120 + 30 = Total birds, which equals 150.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we must first calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost as $4 + 0.25 * $4 = $4 + $1 = $5. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so its cost is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling these cards is $50. Given that each card is sold for $1.5, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we first simplify the equation:

x * 1 = 50

Now, divide both sides by 1:

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can analyze the situation as follows. The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This implies that the caterer had 18 hotdogs set aside for guests who would receive two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests ultimately arrived, and each guest requested a second hotdog. Since the caterer had 18 hotdogs initially prepared for two hotdogs, this means that the caterer had a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

Since 40 guests requested a second hotdog, and there were only 36 hotdogs available, the caterer was unable to fulfill the request for the remaining 4 guests. Therefore, these 4 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. 

Since Indras' name has 6 letters, we find half of this number by dividing 6 by 2, which equals 3. 

Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3, resulting in 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: 

- The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
- The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
- The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is the sum of these individual costs: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount on the total cost. This can be found by multiplying the total cost by 0.20: 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to obtain the final amount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora still needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The sum of the costs is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find the amount she still needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

$1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information provided step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Since Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, we can calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew as follows:

Number of dragons Prince Arthur slew = (3/4) * 100 = 75

Next, we are told that Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:

Number of dragons Prince Walter slew = 2 * 75 = 150

Finally, we are informed that Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew can be calculated as:

Number of dragons Prince Bruce slew = (1/5) * 150 = 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we must first calculate the volume of a single container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the volume of one container by dividing the total volume by the number of containers.

Volume of one container = Total volume / Number of containers
= 15 gallons / 5
= 3 gallons

Now, we need to find 1/4 of the volume of one container to determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed.

1/4 of 3 gallons = 3 * 1/4
= 3/4 gallon

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3/4 gallon to pints.

3/4 gallon * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we can start by calculating the total amount of money he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

Given that George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount he spent on candy bars. The amount left is 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents. Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we can find the number of candy bars by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar, which is 75 cents. This gives us 495 / 75 = 6.6.

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we can employ a straightforward division approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Ray set aside 5 for himself. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he initially had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we can divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the pieces they consumed is equal to the weight of two pieces. 

Given that the cake is cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the weight of one piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces. 

Weight of one piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had by multiplying the weight of one piece by 2.

Total weight of the two pieces = Weight of one piece * 2
Total weight of the two pieces = 2.5 ounces * 2
Total weight of the two pieces = 5 ounces

Finally, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight of the two pieces from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges available for sharing. Sitti and Juris initially possess 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. Combining these quantities yields a total of 56 oranges.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of individuals, including Sitti, Juris, and their six friends. The total number of individuals is 8.

Now, we perform the division: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound, resulting in a total cost of $4.00. Additionally, Antoine requires 2 boxes of beef stock, each priced at $2.00, adding another $4.00 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine the optimal departure time for Bernadette, we must first establish the time it takes for each individual to reach the theater. Given that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to arrive at the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment is four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater is 4 times the time it takes Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 - 5 = 1 minute earlier.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Next, we can utilize the formula for the area of a rectangle, Area = Length * Width, to find the width. Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width as follows:

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

With the length and width known, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we must first calculate the total number of beads each sister acquired.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, with each pack containing 20 beads. Therefore, Elizabeth's total is 1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 41 beads.

Margareth, on the other hand, purchased 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, with each pack containing 20 beads. Thus, Margareth's total is 3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 83 beads.

To find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we subtract Elizabeth's total from Margareth's total: 83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the cumulative effects of both the heating and cooling processes.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. During the 3-hour baking period, the oven's temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, resulting in a total temperature increase of 15 degrees. Therefore, the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

However, the house's temperature is further affected by the 30-minute window opening. The cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, which translates to 0.2 degrees per minute. Over the 30-minute period, the temperature decreases by 0.2 * 30 = 6 degrees. Consequently, the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

First, we calculate James' swim time, which is 10% faster than Jon's. This can be expressed as 0.9 times Jon's swim time. So, James' swim time is 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes.

Next, we calculate James' bike time, which is 5 minutes longer than Jon's. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation to represent this:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:

170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:

59 = x

Therefore, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can start by converting the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C as follows:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B can be found by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes, we must convert the time from minutes to hours.

Time (in hours) = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by the horse:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay consumed is:
8 bails (since 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails)

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to:
6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, the total number of eggs becomes 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, and each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs each tray can hold is 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

To find out how many trays Rozanne can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 / 25 = 2.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we must first calculate the total points earned by each player after their respective turns.

Joey initially had 214 points and scored an additional 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy, who started with 225 points, scored 10 points, increasing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

The difference between their scores can be calculated by subtracting Marcy's total from Joey's total: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman initially purchased 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them at a discounted price of $20 each, generating $340 in revenue. The remaining sneakers, 31 in total, were sold to a department store at a price of $25 each, resulting in an additional $775 in revenue. 

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $340 + $775 = $1115. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of colors in each type of packet and then summing them together.

We are given that six packets contain 8 colors each, and four packets contain 16 colors each. To find the total number of colors, we can calculate the product of the number of packets and the number of colors in each type of packet.

For the six packets with 8 colors each, the total number of colors is 6 * 8 = 48.

For the four packets with 16 colors each, the total number of colors is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we can find the overall total by adding the number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as P and the cost of the soda as S.

We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda. The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, and the cost of the soda is $3. We are also given that the total cost without the super ticket is $18, which is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

We can set up the equation as follows:

$12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + S (soda) = $18

We also know that the cost of the super ticket includes the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $1 = $19.

We can set up another equation as follows:

$12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + S (soda) = $19

Since we know the cost of the soda (S = $3), we can substitute this value into both equations:

$12 + P + $3 = $18
$12 + P + $3 = $19

Simplifying both equations, we get:

$15 + P = $18
$15 + P = $19

Subtracting $15 from both sides of both equations, we get:

P = $3
P = $4

However, since the cost of the soda is $3, the correct answer is the one that makes the most sense in the context of the problem. Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we must first establish the new cost per balloon. Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. With a $20 increase in cost per balloon, the new cost per balloon is $900 / 20 + $20 = $55.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the increased rate: 170 x $55 = $9350.

The final answer is: $9350"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car travels at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Subsequently, it travels at a speed of 30 mph for 1 hour, covering an additional 30 miles. The total distance traveled is therefore 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she has retained and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna possesses 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 of them. Consequently, she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she has retained is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. Therefore, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples consumed by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since both individuals consume 4 apples daily, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Multiplying this daily total by the number of days (30) yields the total number of apples consumed over the specified period: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will consume a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we must first calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds. The volume of one bed is given by the product of its dimensions: length x width x height = 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, and therefore, the total cost will be 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find this by multiplying the number of red cards by 1.6 (which is equivalent to 100% + 60%).

Number of green cards = 15 * 1.6 = 24

Next, we are told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Finally, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. Twenty minutes later, an additional 25 fairies arrived from the east, increasing the total to 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes after that, 30 fairies departed, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies. This can be achieved by adding the number of puppies from Jennifer's dog (8) to the number of puppies from Brandon's dog (12).

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Since Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots, we can calculate this as follows:

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of the puppies have spots.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we must calculate the weight of each item and sum them together.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, the weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required to transport the feed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck, which is 2250 pounds. 

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans a week, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. Each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles a week, so her weekly earnings from plastic bottles is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we'll find her total weekly earnings by adding her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To determine her monthly earnings, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can start by calculating the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 0.6 * Frederick's plants

Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards, and five boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards. 

The total number of basketball cards can be calculated as 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards. Similarly, the total number of baseball cards is 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

To find the number of students, we divide the remaining cards by 10, as each student received 10 cards. Therefore, the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples each of them purchased and then subtract the discount received by each.

Becky's total cost can be found by multiplying the number of apples (20) by the price per apple (0.45 dollars), resulting in a total of $9.00. After applying the $1 discount, Becky's final payment is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Kelly's total cost can be found by multiplying the number of apples (20) by the price per apple (0.50 dollars), resulting in a total of $10.00. After applying the 10% discount, Kelly's final payment is $10.00 - (0.10 * $10.00) = $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

To find the difference in their payments, we subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we must first establish the number of each item per room. 

Each room consists of two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets, and twice as many towels as pillow cases. This can be represented as:

- Sheets: 2 per room
- Comforter: 1 per room
- Pillow cases: 2 * 2 = 4 per room
- Towels: 4 * 2 = 8 per room

Now, we calculate the total number of pieces per room by summing these values:
2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of pieces per room by 80:
15 * 80 = 1200

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, Fireman Frank possesses 200 shoes. On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs, which equates to 10 individual shoes (since each pair consists of 2 shoes). This brings his total to 200 + 10 = 210 shoes. 

On Wednesday, he gains an additional 15 pairs, which amounts to 30 shoes. Consequently, his total increases to 210 + 30 = 240 shoes. 

Finally, on Friday, he acquires 30 more pairs, adding 60 shoes to his collection. This results in a total of 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he disposes of 180 shoes. Therefore, the number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is 120."

"To determine the number of pencils left, we can break down the problem into several steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we find the number of pencils used in two months, which is 1/5 of the total pencils: (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Then, we subtract the pencils used from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils to find the pencils left at the end of the year: (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we can establish a relationship between the number of carrot sticks and the number of cookies he consumes. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as x. According to the given information, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This relationship can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21) to find the daily walking time:

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

Therefore, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes per day for 4 days a week to break in his new shoes in 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11.43}$"
"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ a straightforward division approach. 

Given that the total expenditure on books is $300 and the cost per book is $15, we can calculate the total number of books purchased as follows:

Total expenditure ÷ Cost per book = Total number of books
$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah distributed an equal number of books among her 4 children, we can then divide the total number of books by the number of children to find the number of books each child received:

Total number of books ÷ Number of children = Number of books per child
20 books ÷ 4 children = 5 books per child

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can employ the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, since 3 kids are allergic to both, we must subtract this overlap to avoid double-counting: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we can calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

"To calculate the total cost of the anniversary getaway, we must first determine the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets can be found by multiplying the cost per ticket ($5000) by the number of people (2), resulting in a total of $10,000.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day, we must first find 20% of $1500. This can be calculated as 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Adding this to the normal price yields a daily hotel cost of $1500 + $300 = $1800. Multiplying this by the number of days (3) gives a total hotel cost of 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we can analyze the information provided. 

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, who has 4 tubes. Therefore, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Additionally, Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, who has 3 tubes. Thus, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Combining these quantities, we find that Jasper has a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is 11."
"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we can start by finding the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To determine the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we can calculate the total earnings of Keegan and Tashay. 

Let's denote the total amount they need to raise as 'x'. We know that Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Therefore, the equation to represent the situation is:

83 + 91 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

174 = x

Since they have already earned $174, we can find the remaining amount needed by subtracting this from their goal:

200 - 174 = 26

Therefore, they need $26 more to reach their goal."
"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his portable media player, we first need to establish the number of songs he currently possesses. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate Luri's current song count by multiplying Gabriel's song count by 3.

Luri's current song count = 3 * 20 = 60 songs

Next, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player, which is the difference between the maximum capacity of his player (100 songs) and the number of songs he already has.

Gabriel's available capacity = 100 - 20 = 80 songs

Now, to determine how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri currently has from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

Fewer songs Luri can add = 80 - 60 = 20 songs

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we can calculate 2/5 of the total number of oranges picked. 

Given that 2/5 of the oranges is equivalent to (2/5) * 60, we can simplify this expression by first multiplying the numerators (2 * 60) and then dividing by the denominator (5). This yields 120/5, which simplifies to 24.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we can multiply the number of oranges he ate (24) by the amount he gave up per orange ($10) to find the total amount given up. This results in 24 * 10 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. According to the problem, the cost of her handbag is $20 less than three times the cost of her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are given that her shoes cost $80, so we can substitute s = 80 into the equation:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

Next, we divide the total miles per week (60 miles) by the miles per hour (10 miles). This calculation results in 6 hours per week.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats required for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Given that each bag of oats contains 50 pounds, we can calculate the number of bags needed by dividing the total amount of oats required by 50: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

"To calculate the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to add the highest temperatures and divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia it is 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia it is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. 

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3: -30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is -10."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we can employ a simple division operation. 

First, we need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save, which is the difference between the total cost of the toy and the amount he already has: $12 - $4 = $8.

Next, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount, which is $2. This will give us the number of days required to accumulate the necessary funds.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount and purchase the toy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we can employ a simple subtraction method. 

First, we calculate the total capacity of the trays, which is 2 trays multiplied by 24 eggs per tray, resulting in 48 eggs. 

Next, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To determine the total cost of the pizzas, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza by multiplying the cost of the small pizza by 3. This is based on the given information that the family-size pizza costs three times as much as the small pizza.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

The total cost can be found by adding the cost of both pizzas together.

Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32 on the two pizzas."
"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we must first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors.

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. Considering the $2.00 coupon, the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor can be found by dividing the total cost by 4. Therefore, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we can break it down into individual layers. 

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, and since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we can assume the average height of these girls is 64 inches. Therefore, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and again, we assume an average height of 64 inches for these girls. The total height of this layer is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 576 inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576 / 12 = 48 feet.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we need to calculate the total minutes she walks per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since Charisma works 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, her total daily walking time can be calculated as 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

As she has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour, her daily walking time is 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes.

To find the total walking time after 5 days, we multiply the daily walking time by the number of days: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine Angela's current age, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, we can express this relationship as:

A + 4 = 3(14)

"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of each type of ride and then summing the results.

The cost of morning rides can be calculated as 2 rides per day multiplied by the duration of the rides, which is 14 days. This yields 2 * 14 = 28 rides. Given that each morning ride costs $6, the total cost of morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

Similarly, the cost of afternoon rides can be determined by multiplying the number of afternoon rides (also 28) by the cost per ride, which is $2. This results in 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we must first calculate the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, resulting in a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The combined total of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the break-even point for the two venues, we can set up an equation based on the costs associated with each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue consists of a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food. Therefore, the total cost of the first venue can be expressed as:

C1 = 200 + 5x

On the other hand, the cost of the second venue is a flat fee of $25 per guest, which includes the cost of food. Hence, the total cost of the second venue can be represented as:

C2 = 25x

To find the break-even point, we equate the costs of the two venues:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 results in:

x = 10

Therefore, the break-even point occurs when there are 10 guests attending the party.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express this as z = y + 7. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, which can be represented as y = x/2.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation x + y + z = 43.

Substituting y = x/2 into the first two equations, we get:

z = x/2 + 7
y = x/2

Substituting these expressions into the total equation, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found by substituting x into the equation z = x/2 + 7:

z = 18/2 + 7
z = 9 + 7
z = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

First, we consider the 2 friends who desire 5 gifts each. The total number of gifts for this group is 2 x 5 = 10.

Next, we examine the 3 friends who wish to receive 2 gifts each. The total number of gifts for this group is 3 x 2 = 6.

To find the overall total, we add the gifts from both groups: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, Cherrie decides to acquire 10 additional gifts. Therefore, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the length of the couch, we can start by establishing the width of the rug. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the rug's width as 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we are told that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, the total cost for these two types of gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Given that Suzie paid a total of $7, the amount spent on the strawberry gum can be found by subtracting the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total: $7 - $3 = $4.

As Suzie purchased two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack can be determined by dividing the total cost of strawberry gum by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick to purchase lumber, we must calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is $4 divided by 200 sticks, resulting in a cost of $0.02 per stick. Conversely, the cost per stick for 2 x 8 lumber is $6 divided by 400 sticks, yielding a cost of $0.015 per stick.

Given that $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, it is evident that purchasing 2 x 8 lumber is the more economical choice. With a budget of $24, Frederick can afford to buy four 2 x 8 lumber pieces.

The total number of sticks Frederick can produce with four 2 x 8 lumber pieces is 4 times 400, which equals 1600 sticks.

"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. Since each dog has four legs, we can assume that each dog requires a pair of snowshoes. Therefore, the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed is equal to the number of dogs, which is 6.

The cost of each pair of snowshoes is $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair:

Total cost = Number of pairs of snowshoes * Cost per pair
Total cost = 6 * $12.00
Total cost = $72.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To determine the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we can calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. This results in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips per week. Given that each bus trip costs $2.20, the total weekly cost of her bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, her savings can be calculated as $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we can start by establishing the number of cows and sheep in each location. 

Given that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, we can calculate the number of cows in the zoo as 30 * 2 = 60 cows. 

Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in the farm as 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in each location by adding the number of cows and sheep: 
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can utilize the given information that Rose purchased 4 times the quantity of both onions and potatoes Sophia acquired. 

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can calculate Sophia's purchases by dividing these quantities by 4.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of items Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds in approximately 7 months, we first need to determine the total number of days available for weight loss. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days. 

Next, we calculate the total calories needed to be burned to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days available for weight loss: 105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his weight loss goal."

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. Since each lap corresponds to a distance of 0.25 kilometers, we can calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25
Total distance = 2 kilometers

Given that Hannah requires 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer, we can then calculate the total amount of water needed by multiplying the total distance by the water requirement per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water requirement per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 * 60
Total water needed = 120 milliliters

Therefore, Hannah will need 120 milliliters of water."
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the amount spent on clothes, which is 20% of the initial $500. This can be found by multiplying 0.20 by $500, resulting in $100. 

Next, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Then, we calculate the amount spent on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining $400. This can be found by multiplying 0.25 by $400, resulting in $100.

Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

"To determine the cost of the house, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Let's denote the cost of the house as 'h' and the cost of the lot as 'l'. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express this relationship as:

h = 3l

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

h + l = 120,000

Substituting h = 3l into the equation, we get:

3l + l = 120,000
4l = 120,000

Now, we can solve for 'l' by dividing both sides by 4:

l = 120,000 / 4
l = 30,000

Since h = 3l, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying 'l' by 3:

h = 3 * 30,000
h = 90,000

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"

J = S/4

We are also given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

J = 36/4
J = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find the number of cookies Kelsie made, which is two times the number of cookies Josh made:

K = 2J
K = 2(9)
K = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he initially possesses. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which amounts to 4 x $10 = $40. Additionally, he has six $20 bills, resulting in 6 x $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. This leaves him with $160 - $80 = $80.

Finally, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply 3/5 by $80, which equals (3/5) x $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her original and new weekly energy consumption.

Ada's original daily energy consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her weekly consumption, we multiply this value by 7 days: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. Given that a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, her original weekly bill is 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

With the addition of a device consuming 2 kilowatts per hour, Ada's new daily energy consumption becomes 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her new weekly consumption is then 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours. Consequently, her new weekly bill is 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can first establish the rate at which one person paints a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house by doubling the time, resulting in 10 days.

With 5 people working together, their combined rate is 5 times greater than the rate of one person. Therefore, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is 10 days divided by 5, which equals 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total time for 5 people to paint a whole house is 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas each person has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This relationship can be expressed as an equation: 20 = x - 2. Solving for x, we find that x = 22. Therefore, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can calculate the difference in the total amount spent and the cost of the headphone set.

The total amount spent is $48, and the cost of the headphone set is $44. Therefore, the remaining amount available for purchasing CDs is $48 - $44 = $4.

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought: $4 ÷ $4 = 1.

Thus, Tom could have bought 1 additional CD if he had not purchased the headphone set.

$1"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we can break down his workout routine into distinct categories based on the hours he spent each week.

Let's denote the number of weeks Josh worked 4 hours as 'x'. Since he worked 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, we can represent this as 2 * 5. Additionally, he worked 6 hours in one week, which we can represent as 1 * 6.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out can be calculated using the formula: 4x + 2 * 5 + 1 * 6.

We know that the total number of weeks is 8, so we can set up the equation: x + 2 + 1 = 8.

Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the original equation: 4 * 5 + 2 * 5 + 1 * 6 = 20 + 10 + 6 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, resulting in 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. Consequently, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining Jame's current age as x. In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old. In 8 years, his cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

We are given that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can start by finding the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost to find the combined cost of the monitors. The total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400. 

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can start by calculating the total number of seashells brought by the girls. Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4x, where x represents the number of seashells brought by each girl. Since there are 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 10(60 + 4x).

We know that the total number of seashells brought by both boys and girls is 20 * 60 = 1200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10(60 + 4x) = 1200

Expanding the equation, we get:

600 + 40x = 1200

Subtracting 600 from both sides, we get:

40x = 600

Dividing both sides by 40, we get:

x = 15

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We are given that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can express this relationship as N = 2G.

We also know that George ate 5 candies, resulting in him having 3 candies left. This can be represented as G - 5 = 3. Solving for G, we find that G = 8.

Substituting G = 8 into the equation N = 2G, we get N = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Nick initially had 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Anne's age, we can start by establishing the age of Alyana. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Next, we are given that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, Anne's age can be calculated by adding 2 to Alyana's age, resulting in 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal, we can calculate the difference between her desired output and the total vlogs she has already produced.

Let's first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

To find out how many vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal, we subtract the total vlogs she has already made from her desired monthly output: 72 (desired output) - 54 (total vlogs made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 can be found by multiplying 0.20 by $50, which equals $10. 

Adding the tip to the original bill, we get $50 + $10 = $60.

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the initial amount each boy receives. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can calculate each boy's share as $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share, resulting in a total of $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

After spending $8 from his total, he is left with $21 - $8 = $13. To triple this amount, we multiply $13 by 3, yielding $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we can start by dividing his total monthly target by 2, as there are 15 days in the second half of April.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the change Verna received, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each type of fruit by its respective price and then summing the results.

The cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of the oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of the peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruit is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received can be calculated as $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, his total earnings are 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, her total earnings are 20 * $0.5 = $10.

The difference in their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, which is $100, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

As a result, Brad receives $20. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share is 4x = 4 * 20 = $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we must consider the round-trip distance to and from work. The distance from his home to work is 3 miles, so the total distance for a round trip is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles per day.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down her writing process into distinct segments and calculate the total number of letters in each segment.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters. Since she repeats this process, the total number of letters in this segment is 26 * 2 = 52.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which comprises 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters). Therefore, the total number of letters in this segment is 52 + 13 = 65.

To find the overall total, we add the number of letters in each segment: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To determine the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. 

In the first round, Ali initiates contact with 3 families. In the subsequent rounds, each family from the previous round serves as a node, and each node branches out to 3 other families. This forms a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The number of families notified in each round can be calculated as follows:

Round 1: 3 families
Round 2: 3 * 3 = 9 families
Round 3: 9 * 3 = 27 families
Round 4: 27 * 3 = 81 families

Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is 81."
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of linear decline. Given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. The total weight lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70 + 30
x = 100

Thus, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we must first establish the target number of toys required for a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set contains 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan requires 2 additional toys to achieve this target. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan currently possesses can be calculated as 400 + 2 = 402.

The final answer is 402."
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.
The discount amount is $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel must spend $27 on all the items he wants to purchase."

Therefore, Carly receives $17 as change.

$17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to consider the commission structure of the marketing company. The commission is comprised of two components: a base commission for sales up to $1000 and an additional commission for sales exceeding $1000.

The base commission for sales up to $1000 is 30% of the sales amount, which can be calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales exceeding $1000, an additional 10% commission is applied to the amount above $1000. In this case, the amount exceeding $1000 is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). Therefore, the additional commission is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find Antonella's total earnings, we add the base commission and the additional commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of bottles he already possesses. Since he has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. With 70 guests and a desire for 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find the number of additional bottles Bill needs to acquire, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we first need to establish the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

Let's denote the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day as C and on a hot day as H. We are given that C = 16 minutes. We also know that H is 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day. Therefore, we can express H as:

H = 2C + 2
H = 2(16) + 2
H = 34 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on each day:

Time on a cold day = 3C = 3(16) = 48 minutes
Time on a hot day = 3H = 3(34) = 102 minutes

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:

Difference = Time on a hot day - Time on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the desired savings by this amount.

John's hourly wage is $2, and he works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. Therefore, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings = hourly wage * hours worked per day * days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week
Weekly earnings = $40/week

Now, we can divide the desired savings by the weekly earnings to find the number of weeks it will take:

Number of weeks = desired savings / weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40/week
Number of weeks = 2 weeks

"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach. We know that there are 21 buttons in total, consisting of 7 buttons with 2 holes each and the remaining 14 buttons with 4 holes each.

First, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes. This can be done by multiplying the number of buttons with 2 holes (7) by the number of holes per button (2), resulting in 7 x 2 = 14 holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes. This can be done by multiplying the number of buttons with 4 holes (14) by the number of holes per button (4), resulting in 14 x 4 = 56 holes.

Finally, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons to obtain the overall total. This is 14 (holes in buttons with 2 holes) + 56 (holes in buttons with 4 holes) = 70 holes.

Therefore, the total number of holes in the bag of buttons is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can start by establishing the relative sizes of the lockers based on the given information. 

First, we know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches in size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's, we can calculate its size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we are told that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches in size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, her consumption is 0.5 cups. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current intake is 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The recommended daily intake is 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from Juan's current intake: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the sum of the hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then adding them together.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters.

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs.

Finally, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to obtain the overall number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their individual weights.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, her weight can be calculated as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Furthermore, Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, resulting in 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the average weight by summing their weights and dividing by 3:

(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. The sun initially occupies the apex of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. 

As the sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it has moved after 10 hours by multiplying the rate by the time: 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Adding this to the initial angle, we obtain the final angle: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees."
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, resulting in a total of 4 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles required by 5. 

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

The cost of 1 pack of 5 candles is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of pages she read in the first week and then adding it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Judy spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she spent reading in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total minutes into pages. We know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 and multiply the result by 2.

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per page = 70 pages

Now that we know Judy read 70 pages in the first week, we can add this to the 100 pages she read in the second week to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks.

70 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"

"To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic methods to determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

Given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, we have S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This relationship can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the process into distinct stages.

Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. This establishes a baseline value.

For the subsequent three teeth, the tooth fairy provided $1.00 for each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

In the final stage, the tooth fairy's generosity decreased by half for each of the last two teeth, with each tooth worth $0.50. This yields a total of 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

To calculate the overall amount, we sum the values from each stage: $5.00 (initial) + $3.00 (subsequent) + $1.00 (final) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, which can be expressed as:
R = M + 20

Additionally, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be written as:
R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals. Substituting R = 80 into the first equation, we can solve for Mark's goals:
80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have found Mark's goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the second equation to solve for Anna's goals:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate the total amount each of them made by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price of each lemonade.

Let's denote the number of lemonades sold by Mitchell as 'n' and the price of each lemonade as 'p'. We are given that n = 21 and p = $4.

The total amount Mitchell made = n * p = 21 * $4 = $84

Liam's earnings are given as $63. To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings = $84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down his expenditure into two categories: wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter has $70. He spends $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, which amounts to $15. This leaves him with $70 - $15 = $55.

For the remaining days (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spends $2 each on plastic action figures. With $55 remaining, he can afford to buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he cannot purchase a fraction of a figure, we can round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total cost of the kitten, we must consider the expenses incurred. The initial cost of spaying the kitten is $200. Additionally, Leah must also account for the cost of the three vaccines, which amounts to $20 per vaccine, resulting in a total of $60. Furthermore, the kitten broke four vases, each costing $12, leading to an additional expense of $48.

To calculate the total cost, we sum these expenses: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308.

The total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

The total number of roses supplied to the shops in a month is the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account over the specified period. Since Katina withdraws $100 every month, we multiply this amount by the number of months in 2 years (24 months). 

$100 * 24 = $2400

Next, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue can be found by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich. In this case, the food truck sold 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $70.00.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and since one loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00. Additionally, the food truck spends $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

Finally, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we first need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can find the total number of crayons by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

Total crayons = 3 * 64
Total crayons = 192

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make from the total number of crayons. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8.

Number of muffin crayons = Total crayons / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 192 / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 24

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

Total amount of money = Number of muffin crayons * Price per muffin
Total amount of money = 24 * $1.50
Total amount of money = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must consider the costs associated with the carpet, padding, and installation. 

First, we calculate the area of the room, which is given by the product of its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we must first determine the total number of birds observed over the 7-day period. 

We can break down the data as follows:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

The total number of birds observed is the sum of these values: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days: 280 / 7 = 40.

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the operations step by step.

First, we calculate half of the starting value of 20, which is 20/2 = 10. Then, we add this result to the starting value: 20 + 10 = 30. Next, we divide the resulting value by 5: 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

The boy possesses 5 cards, while his brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. This implies that the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. 

To find the total number of cards, we can add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is in error. This can be found by dividing the difference between the actual temperature (468) and the set temperature (450), then dividing by the set temperature and multiplying by 100.

The error is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is then (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of the target temperature (520). This can be calculated as 0.04 * 520 = 20.8 degrees.

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we must first convert the time of each film to minutes. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, resulting in 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, yielding 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To determine the combined value of the two houses, we first need to calculate the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. 

We can find 30% of Herb's house value by multiplying his house value by 0.3. 

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.

Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Finally, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The combined value of the two houses is $129,200."
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we must first establish the quantities of cups and dishes each individual brought.

Judy initially purchased a dozen cups, which equates to 12 cups. Furthermore, she acquired twice the number of dishes as cups, resulting in 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend, on the other hand, brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, which translates to 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The combined total of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The combined total of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is the sum of cups and dishes, which is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the discounted price of 2 boxes. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 

First, we calculate the discount amount: 10% of $100.00 is $10.00. Subtracting this from the original price yields a discounted price of $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box.

Since Pete is purchasing 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Next, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Given that 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

Finally, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we must first calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, resulting in a total of 3 hours. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which equates to 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Additionally, he worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, amounting to 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Consequently, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. With an hourly wage of $10, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours engaging in aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, resulting in a total of 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Additionally, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour, adding 1 * 600 = 600 calories to her total. 

The combined total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since Hannah requires 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs by dividing the total calories burned by 200.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Therefore, Hannah needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Additionally, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combining like terms, we have:

3B = 4500

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine Jared's average typing speed, we must first calculate the third measurement. His initial speed was 47 words per minute (WPM), and it increased by 5 WPM to 52 WPM. Therefore, the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Next, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over a 5-week period.

Let's denote the weight change per week for the Cheerios option as -1.25 pounds and for the donuts option as 1.75 pounds. 

The total weight change for the Cheerios option over 5 weeks is -1.25 * 5 = -6.25 pounds.

The total weight change for the donuts option over 5 weeks is 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can employ a systematic approach to account for all the individuals involved.

First, we consider the initial number of people invited by Alex, which is 100. Each of these individuals plans to bring 2 friends, resulting in an additional 200 people. Furthermore, Alex directly invites 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding 18 more individuals to the count.

To calculate the total number of attendees, we sum the initial number of people invited, the number of friends brought by those initially invited, and the number of friends' spouses. This yields a total of 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318 people.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

The final answer is: $\boxed{318}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we know that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Given that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund's weight can be calculated as 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, we are informed that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Therefore, the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, it is stated that the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Consequently, the Mastiff's weight can be calculated as 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the comparative cost of the boots on eBay versus Amazon, we must calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16, and shipping costs $4, resulting in a total cost of $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's window, we can model the growth of the beanstalk using exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day $n$ as $h_n$. We can express the height of the beanstalk on day $n$ as:

$h_n = 4 \cdot 2^{n-1}$

We want to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $h_n > 20$. To do this, we can set up the inequality:

$4 \cdot 2^{n-1} > 20$

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

$2^{n-1} > 5$

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

$n-1 > \log_2(5)$

Solving for $n$, we get:

$n > 1 + \log_2(5)$

Using a calculator, we find that $\log_2(5) \approx 2.32$. Therefore:

$n > 3.32$

Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $n = 4$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of protein John consumes per week, we can start by calculating his daily protein intake. Given that each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the daily protein intake as follows:

First, we need to establish the number of cups John consumes daily. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the number of cups as follows:

200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Next, we can calculate the daily protein intake by multiplying the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup:

2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find the weekly protein intake, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

Therefore, John consumes 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic methods to represent Jerry's age. Let's denote Jerry's current age as x.

Given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can establish the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Thus, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we must first calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of each implant is $2000, and George requires two implants, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $2000 = $4000. Additionally, he wishes to have a crown made of porcelain, which incurs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already made an initial payment of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to pay, we subtract the initial payment from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Given that George earns $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he must work to cover the remaining amount by dividing the remaining balance by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. Similarly, the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

We can express the sum of the angles as an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can determine the measures of the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the third angle is the largest, its measure is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of money he possesses. 

Colby has 8 quarters, which equates to 8 x $0.25 = $2. He also has 6 dimes, yielding 6 x $0.10 = $0.60. Additionally, he possesses 14 nickels, resulting in 14 x $0.05 = $0.70. Lastly, he has 15 pennies, which amounts to 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

The total amount of money Colby has is the sum of these values: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of a single gumball: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can purchase 69 gumballs.

The final answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we must consider the number of legs associated with each type of animal. Dogs, being quadruped mammals, possess four legs each, while cats are also quadruped mammals with four legs. Birds, on the other hand, are bipedal, possessing two legs each.

Given the respective quantities of dogs (5), cats (2), and birds (10), we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

- Dogs: 5 * 4 = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 * 4 = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 * 2 = 20 legs

Adding these values together yields a total of 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we first need to calculate the weight he initially increased by 50%. This can be found by multiplying the original weight (8 pounds) by 0.5 (which represents 50% as a decimal).

Weight increase = 8 pounds * 0.5 = 4 pounds

The new weight Jamaal initially used is the original weight plus the calculated increase, which is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal ultimately decides to use a weight two pounds lighter than the initial increase. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from the weight he initially increased by 50%.

New weight = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down his gaming activity into three distinct periods: his first year, his second year, and his third year.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This results in a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve again receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This yields a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month. This results in a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games. Furthermore, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we sum the number of games from each year: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. The initial rate of the plane is calculated as the ratio of distance to time, which is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we can apply this rate to find the additional time needed to cover the additional 2000 miles. The time required can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we first need to calculate their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's production rate can be found by dividing the total amount of chocolates he makes in 2 hours by 2. This yields 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's production rate. Therefore, her hourly production rate is (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates each person makes in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending for each day:

On Monday, he spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is the sum of these individual expenditures: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Initially, Howard had $100. To find the amount of money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:

$100 - $88 = $12.

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we can break down his earnings into two distinct periods: the first four hours and the next two hours.

During the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This results in an hourly revenue of $7.50. Multiplying this by the number of hours worked, we get:

$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

In the subsequent two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This yields an hourly revenue of $6.00. Multiplying this by the number of hours worked, we get:

$6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12

The total earnings can be found by adding the revenues from both periods:

$30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tire, we must first calculate the total number of rotations it can undergo. Given that each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times and every 2 miles, the tire rotates 725 times. 

We can calculate the total number of miles driven per year by multiplying the miles driven per month (400) by 12. This yields 4800 miles/year. Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we can calculate the lifespan of the tire by dividing the total number of rotations it can undergo by the number of rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

Therefore, the tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 4362.5"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we must first establish the cost per washing. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can calculate the cost per washing as follows:

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can then calculate the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of pumps used per wash:

Cost per pump = Cost per washing / 1 pump
= $0.20 / 1
= $0.20

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:

Cost per pump = $0.20 * 100
= 20 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the outfit. The shirt has a discounted price of $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The pair of shorts costs $35. Therefore, the total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax amount. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), the sales tax is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

To find the amount of money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70.

The final amount of money Joe will have left is -$6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to produce 1 dozen croissants, we can establish a conversion factor of 1/4 pound per dozen. 

Given that Juan aims to produce 4 dozen croissants daily for a period of 7 days, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed as follows:

First, we multiply the number of croissants by the butter requirement per dozen: 4 dozen * 1/4 pound = 1 pound per day.

Next, we multiply the daily butter requirement by the number of days: 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to produce 4 dozen croissants daily for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we must first calculate the total cost of repaving each street. This can be achieved by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of each street.

For Monica's street, the cost is $194 per meter, and it is 150 meters long. Therefore, the total cost for Monica's street is $194 * 150 = $29,100.

Similarly, for Lewis' street, the cost is $194 per meter, and it is 490 meters long. Thus, the total cost for Lewis' street is $194 * 490 = $95,060.

To find the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on. 

The funding for the remaining 5 months is $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000.

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000.

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we must consider the individual contributions of each player. 

The first player consumed a 6-ounce steak. The second player consumed 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces. Since the fourth and fifth players opted for vegetarian meals, they did not contribute to the total ounces of meat consumed.

To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed, we sum the individual contributions: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we must first consider the number of days in the month. March has 31 days.

Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can calculate the total number of posts by multiplying the number of posts per day by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = 3 posts/day * 31 days
Total number of posts in March = 93 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To determine Gary's annual expenditure on laundry water, we must first calculate the total gallons of water utilized in a year. Given that he performs laundry twice a week, we can calculate the total number of loads per year as 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads.

Each load of laundry requires 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, and therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we must calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

The initial cost of the aquarium is $10.00. Additionally, she purchased 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Furthermore, she acquired 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, yielding a total cost of 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. She also purchased 20 fish at $0.50 each, resulting in a total cost of 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Lastly, she required fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by summing the individual costs:
$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

The total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can calculate its growth pattern. The beanstalk doubles in height every week, and it initially grows 4 inches in the third week.

Let's break down the growth:

Week 1: The beanstalk is 3 inches tall.

Week 2: Since it doubles in height, the new height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Week 3: It grows an additional 4 inches, making the total height 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. Given that he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, the total daily meat sales can be calculated as:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Next, we divide the total weight of the bull (750 kg) by the daily meat sales (150 kg) to find the number of days required to sell the meat:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to calculate the total number of seats. With 4 rows of seats, each containing 18 seats, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by administrators. One-fourth of the total seats are occupied by administrators, which is 72 * 1/4 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats after removing those occupied by administrators are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats: 54 * 1/3 = 18 seats.

Finally, to find the number of seats occupied by students, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats: 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Therefore, there are 36 students in the school auditorium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 intersections, the total number of street lights can be found by multiplying the number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections. This yields 4 * 6 = 24 street lights.

However, we are informed that 20 of these street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of street lights. Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is 24 - 20 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the number of times each DVD has been used. 

Let's denote the number of times the first DVD has been played as x and the number of times the second DVD has been played as y. We are given that x = 356 and y = 135. 

We know that the first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks, so we can set up the equation x ≤ 1000. Similarly, the second DVD can be played 865 times before it breaks, so we can set up the equation y ≤ 865.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to find the minimum value of x + y that satisfies both inequalities. 

x + y ≤ 1000 + 865
x + y ≤ 1865

Since x = 356 and y = 135, we can substitute these values into the equation:

356 + 135 ≤ 1865
491 ≤ 1865

This inequality is true, so the total number of times both DVDs can be played is 1865.

The final answer is: 1865"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we must first calculate the total number of hours he spent in therapy. Since he attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, we can calculate the total number of sessions as follows:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

Given that the cost per hour is $125, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of hours by the cost per hour:

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down his gum-chewing activities into distinct periods.

First, we calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can calculate the total number of pieces he chews at school as 8 / 2 = 4 pieces.

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to his total.

The total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, when he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we can calculate it by subtracting 12 from her age in 12 years. This is based on the concept of time and age progression.

Let's denote Charmaine's current age as 'x'. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can set up the equation:

x + 12 = 16

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Therefore, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

To find her age 4 years from now, we can add 4 to her current age:

Age in 4 years = 4 + 4
Age in 4 years = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"To determine the difference in spending between the two coaches, we can calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 * $3 = $27.

The basketball coach, on the other hand, acquired 8 basketballs at $14 each, leading to a total expenditure of 8 * $14 = $112.

The difference in spending between the two coaches can be calculated as $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers, we first calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. With 10 rows and 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5. This gives us 200 * 4/5 = 160.

Therefore, the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. This can be achieved by dividing her speed by 1000, as 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

Given that Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, we can calculate her speed in Mb per second as follows:

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can then multiply her speed by 60 to obtain her speed in Mb per hour:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To determine the total number of cars towed that week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

Let's start by calculating the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days to find the total:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. The problem states that the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day on these days, so we subtract 4 from the original rate of 10 cars per day:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Now, we multiply this reduced rate by the number of remaining days (4 days) to find the total number of cars towed on these days:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Finally, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to find the overall total:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to meet the height requirement, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years as 't'. Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, his height after 't' years can be represented as 40 + 2t.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 48 inches. Setting up an equation to find 't', we have:

40 + 2t = 48

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

2t = 8

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

t = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine James' earnings, we must first calculate the profit made on the sale of the vehicles. The total cost of the cars is $250,000, as 10 cars were sold at $25,000 each. The company's payment for the cars represents 30% of this total cost, which equates to $75,000.

The profit is then calculated by subtracting the company's payment from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James' total earnings are $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can find this number by multiplying 0.25 by 100, which equals 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, resulting in 15. 

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total price of the three jewels, we can start by establishing the relationship between the prices of the gold, silver, and diamond jewels. Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

Given that the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, we can express this relationship as:

G = (4/5)D

We are also given that the cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, which can be represented as:

S = G - 400

Furthermore, we know that the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. We can use this information to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

First, we can find the price of the gold jewel by substituting D = $2000 into the equation G = (4/5)D:

G = (4/5) * $2000
G = $1600

Next, we can find the price of the silver jewel by substituting G = $1600 into the equation S = G - 400:

S = $1600 - $400
S = $1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can calculate the total price by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the value of S into the second equation to find T: T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Then, we can substitute the value of T into the third equation to find R: R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since they are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17. We are also given that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, which can be expressed as D = N - 6. Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Furthermore, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3. Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class.

Let's denote the total number of classes as 'n'. The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. We can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

10n ≤ 60

To find the maximum number of classes, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 10:

n ≤ 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting 10 from 6:

6 - 10 = -4

However, since Manny cannot miss a negative number of classes, we can conclude that he can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total weekly production of Julie and Jewel, we must first establish their individual daily production rates. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast, Julie's daily production rate is 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The combined daily production rate is the sum of their individual rates: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

To calculate the total weekly production, we multiply the combined daily production rate by the number of working days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we can start by establishing the relationship between the distances covered by Reggie and Paisley. Since Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley covered, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can express this as an equation: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3. Substituting Reggie's distance, we get 20 = Lynn's distance + 3.

Solving for Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: Lynn's distance = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them.

The cost of 5 apples can be found by multiplying the number of apples by the cost per apple: 5 * $5.20 = $26.00.

Similarly, the cost of 5 oranges is obtained by multiplying the number of oranges by the cost per orange: 5 * $3.30 = $16.50.

The total cost is the sum of these two values: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

The final answer is: $42.50"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to determine the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole in this case, is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

Given that the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we must calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."

The new monthly salary can be calculated as follows:

$20,000 (original salary) + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

To find the annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

$31,000 x 12 = $372,000

Therefore, Tim's new annual salary is $372,000."
"To determine the total cost of James' purchases, we must calculate the cost of each item and then sum them.

The cost of the suits can be found by multiplying the number of suits (10) by the cost per suit ($750), resulting in a total of $7500. 

The cost of the dress pants is one-fifth of the cost of a single suit, which is $750 * (1/5) = $150. Multiplying this by the number of pants (10) yields a total cost of $1500.

The cost of the dress shirts is $60 per shirt, and James purchased 10 shirts, resulting in a total cost of $600.

Finally, we add the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts together: $7500 + $1500 + $600 = $9000.

The total cost of everything is $9000."

1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. T = W / 2
4. SW = T - 3

We can start by finding the value of W using the first equation:
W = S + 4
W = 60 + 4
W = 64

Next, we can find the value of T using the third equation:
T = W / 2
T = 64 / 2
T = 32

Finally, we can find the value of SW using the fourth equation:
SW = T - 3
SW = 32 - 3
SW = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we must first calculate the amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion. This yields 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we then multiply the amount in one bag by the number of bags. Therefore, 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

Alisa's distance can be calculated as 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours, resulting in 54 miles.

The sum of their distances is 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is 79."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we can break down the problem into two parts: digging through the soil and digging through the clay.

Let's denote the time it takes to dig through the soil as t_s and the time it takes to dig through the clay as t_c. We are given that Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that rate, or 2 feet/hour, through clay. The total distance to be covered is 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

t_s = 24 / 4 = 6 hours (time to dig through the soil)
t_c = 8 / 2 = 4 hours (time to dig through the clay)

The total time it takes to dig the well is the sum of the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:

Total time = t_s + t_c = 6 + 4 = 10 hours

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should purchase, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of individuals he needs to provide cupcakes for. This includes himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

The total number of individuals is the sum of Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes required can be calculated as follows:

2 (Howie) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 28

Since each individual will receive 2 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes needed is 28 * 2 = 56.

Therefore, Howie should buy 56 cupcakes.

The final answer is 56."
"To determine the total number of likes, we can start by finding the initial number of likes. We know that three weeks after the initial post, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

We can set up the equation: 70x = 2000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 70:

x = 2000 / 70
x = 28.57

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes:

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 28.57 + 20000
Total likes ≈ 20128.57

However, since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a like. Therefore, the total number of likes is approximately 20128.

The final answer is 20128."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, resulting in a total cost of $400. After receiving a $2 discount, the final cost was $398.

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, which equates to $60. Therefore, the final cost was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can start by calculating her sales for each month.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats in the first month were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can express this as:

Red sales = 1/2 * G
Red sales = $400

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
G = 2 * $400
G = $800

Now that we know the sales from green hats in the first month, we can calculate the total sales for the first month:
Total sales (first month) = Red sales + G
Total sales (first month) = $400 + $800
Total sales (first month) = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can express this as:
Second month sales = 3/4 * Total sales (first month)
Second month sales = 3/4 * $1200
Second month sales = $900

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales from both months:
Total sales (two months) = Total sales (first month) + Second month sales
Total sales (two months) = $1200 + $900
Total sales (two months) = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we must first calculate the number of paid hours. James rented the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, a total of 4 hours. However, he receives 1 hour of free time, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour. Therefore, the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first paid hour and the cost of the remaining hours, which is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's denote Sally's weekly wage as W and the amount withheld as x. We know that her bank account balance at the start of the week was $200 and at the end of the week was $420. Since she received no other money into her bank account, the change in her bank account balance is solely due to the amount withheld from her wage.

We can set up the equation: W - x = 420 - 200
Simplifying the equation, we get: W - x = 220

We are also given that Sally's weekly wage should be $300. We can substitute this value for W in the equation: 300 - x = 220

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 300 from both sides of the equation: -x = 220 - 300
-x = -80

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: x = 80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we can start by calculating the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 16 * 3 = 48.

As each deviled egg requires 2 halves, we can find the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2. This yields 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 since there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, the number of dozens needed is 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the number of pages she has left by subtracting 1/3 from 1 (the whole paper). 

To do this, we can convert 1 to a fraction with a common denominator, which is 3. So, 1 can be written as 3/3.

Now, we can subtract 1/3 from 3/3:

3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3

Since 2/3 represents 2/3 of the paper, we can multiply it by the total number of pages to find the number of pages Shiela has left to write:

(2/3) * 15 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. By dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads daily, we can calculate the number of days required to complete the assignment.

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Given that Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days required to finish the book from the total deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we must consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the relationship between the rent and fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To determine the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (initial purchase price) + $180,000 (first year's costs) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can start by establishing the cooking time for each item. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes.

We are also given that P = R + 20, which allows us to calculate the cooking time for pork as P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Furthermore, we know that B = (P + R) / 2. Substituting the values of P and R, we get B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can calculate the cost of each component and then find the difference.

Let's start by finding the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is $5, and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. Therefore, the total cost of this mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is $2, and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. Thus, the total cost of this mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures by subtracting the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We are given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70, where 4s accounts for the legs of the sheep and 2g accounts for the legs of the geese.

The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20, as each animal has one head.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can find 'g' by substituting 's' into the equation g = 20 - s:
g = 20 - 15
g = 5

Therefore, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we must first calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

The cost of the coffee can be found by multiplying the number of pounds Roger needs (7) by the cost per pound of the more expensive brand ($6). This yields a total cost of 7 * $6 = $42.

Next, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased, excluding the pie. 

The cost of two bags of chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Adding the cost of a bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and a bottle of soda ($1.00), we get a subtotal of $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can find the cost of the apple pie by subtracting the subtotal from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We know that the total number of newspapers delivered is 600, and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C combined is 198 + 209 = 407. 

Using this information, we can set up the following equation:

x + 407 = 600

To solve for x, we subtract 407 from both sides of the equation:

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we must first calculate the total amount of time he spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can calculate the total class time as follows:

Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week

Given that the class duration spans 6 weeks, we can then calculate the total class time as:

Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, we can determine the number of recipes John learns by dividing the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe, which is 1.5 hours. 

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 32 recipes

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the number of math teachers, we can calculate 100% of the total number of teachers minus the percentage of history teachers. 

First, we find 100% of the total number of teachers: 
100% of 150 = 1 * 150 = 150

Next, we find 60% of the total number of teachers to determine the number of history teachers:
60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90

Now, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:
150 - 90 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6 = 360 hours"
"To determine the amount of money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we can start by calculating the individual amounts.

Given that Aurelia has $120, we can find Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4, which yields 90 dollars. Then, we can find Rayna's amount by adding 60 to Kassidy's amount, resulting in 150 dollars.

The total amount of money is the sum of their individual amounts: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find the amount each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 ÷ 3 = 120 dollars.

Therefore, each person would have 120 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total duration of the game, we must consider the standard 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes, and the additional 5 minutes added due to the tie. 

The total time for the 4 regular quarters is calculated as follows: 4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes. 

Adding the 5-minute extension due to the tie, the total game duration is 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{53}$"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to find 20% of the total number of employees, which is 50. This can be calculated as 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees. 

Next, we are told that only 30% of these 10 employees oversee the entire company. To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we calculate 30% of 10, which is 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we can calculate the amount of each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

For flour, we multiply the amount per muffin (5 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons.

Similarly, for sugar, we multiply the amount per muffin (3 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons.

Lastly, for salt, we multiply the amount per muffin (0.25 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients required is the sum of these three values: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each person would have after pooling and sharing it equally, we must first calculate the total amount of candy. This can be achieved by summing the individual amounts of candy each person had: 3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds.

Since they wish to divide the total amount equally among the three individuals, we then divide the total by 3. This results in 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased. The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 times the cost of one candy, which is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost of type A candies is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.

Similarly, the cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 times the cost of one candy, which is $0.75. Thus, the total cost of type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is the sum of the costs of type A and type B candies, which is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can start by analyzing the given information. Christina records her mood every day on a calendar, and over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days and eight bad days, with the rest being neutral. The first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral.

We can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. To find the total number of good days in the month, we can add the initial good days to the additional good days:
12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we first convert the initial height from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches per day. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the initial height of 20 feet is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Next, we need to determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the initial height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required by dividing the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating that each dog requires one toy. This establishes a baseline of 4 toys.

As the number of dogs in the shelter increases, James must acquire additional toys to meet the demand. With 8 more dogs added to the initial 4, the total number of dogs becomes 12. Consequently, James needs 12 toys to accommodate the increased population.

However, upon returning, James finds that the number of dogs has doubled, resulting in 24 dogs. Nevertheless, 3 dogs have since departed, leaving 21 dogs in need of toys. Therefore, James must acquire 21 toys to fulfill the current demand.

The total number of toys James needs is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the amount invested by Dylan. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
= (2/5) * 1200
= 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
= 720

Then, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We can calculate this as:
Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
= 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount invested by Skyler:
Skyler's investment = 720 - 480
= 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240."
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can start by finding the total number of signatures they have already collected. 

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We are given that C = 20 and J = 44. 

The total number of signatures they have collected is the sum of their individual collections: C + J = 20 + 44 = 64.

Since the sisters aim to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we can set up an equation to represent their goal: C + J + x = 100, where x is the number of signatures they need to collect.

Substituting the known values, we get 20 + 44 + x = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we have 64 + x = 100.

To find the value of x, we subtract 64 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 64.

x = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we must first establish her hourly wage. Given that Karen's hourly wage is twice that of Lorie's, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage can be calculated as 2 * $10 = $20.

With this information, we can then calculate Karen's daily earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day, which is 3. This yields $20 * 3 = $60.

Finally, to find Karen's earnings over a two-day period, we multiply her daily earnings by 2, resulting in $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportionality. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

This ratio can be simplified to 1 potato : 6 hash browns. To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the ratio of hash browns per potato.

Number of hash browns = 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato
= 96 * 6
= 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"To determine the excess weight of the group, we must first calculate the total weight of the individuals. Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can find the total weight by multiplying the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of cookies each individual has.

Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as K, Max has as M, the Cookie Monster has as C, and Summer has as S. We are given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can use these equations to solve for the number of cookies each person has.

From equation (1), we can express M in terms of K:
M = K + 5

Substituting this expression for M into equation (2), we get:
C + 12 = K + 5
C = K - 7

Now, we can substitute the expression for M into equation (3):
S = (K + 5) + 23
S = K + 28

We are given that K = 68. We can substitute this value into the expressions for M and S:
M = 68 + 5
M = 73
S = 68 + 28
S = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + (68 - 7) + 96
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (x). Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to isolate x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the total time as 't'. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can set up the following equation:

t = (1/2)t + (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t = (1/2)t + 20

Subtracting (1/2)t from both sides:

(1/2)t = 20

Multiplying both sides by 2:

t = 40

Therefore, it took Chris 40 minutes to mow the lawn.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to reach school without being late, we must first calculate the total time they've spent walking thus far. This can be achieved by adding the time taken to reach the corner (6 minutes) and the time taken to reach the fire station (13 minutes).

Total time spent walking = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Given that they have 30 minutes available, we can then subtract the total time spent walking from the total available time to find the remaining time.

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking
= 30 - 19
= 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to reach school without being late."
"To determine the total cost of Catherine's grocery purchase, we can calculate the cost of each item individually and then sum them up.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. Since Catherine buys 1 kilo, the total cost for apples is $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is $2 per kilo, so the total cost for bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is $3 per kilo, so the total cost for oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the costs of all items together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine paid a total of $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the combined total of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After consuming 10 cookies, the remaining number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, the age of the older triplet would be x + 7, and the age of the older twin would be x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides gives us:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-examine our initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

This can be rewritten as:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x must be a whole number, we can try to find a whole number solution. Let's re-examine the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

We can rewrite this as:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

However, we can try to find a whole number solution by re-examining the original equation. Let's try x = 7:

7 + (7 + 7) + (7 + 7 + 7) = 7 + 14 + 21 = 42

This is close to the target, but not quite there. Let's try x = 8:

8 + (8 + 7) + (8 + 7 + 7) = 8 + 15 + 22 = 45

This exceeds the target. Since we're looking for a combination of ages that sum to 44, we can try x = 7.33 (which is not a whole number) or x = 7.33 is not a whole number, so we try x = 7.

7 + (7 + 7) + (7 + 7 + 7) = 7 + 14 + 21 = 42

This is close to the target, but not quite there. Let's try x = 7.33 (which is not a whole number), so we try x = 7.

7 + (7 + 7) + (7 + 7 + 7) = 7 + 14 + 21 = 42

This is close to the target, but not quite there. Let's try x = 7.

"To determine the amount of time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time he has before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time John dedicates to his homework. He has 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history, resulting in a total of 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the amount of time John has available for a nap: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two separate calculations. 

First, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops by multiplying the cost of one lollipop by 10:
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one candy by 10:
10 candies * $3.20 = $32.00

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, his monthly savings can be calculated as 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins.

The total number of coins saved by Rong in a year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins, and by Neil is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

To find the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10. This gives us 240 * 10 = 2400 coins for Rong and 336 * 10 = 3360 coins for Neil.

Therefore, the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount of money John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the vet visit. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and John's dog requires 2 vaccines. Therefore, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let the total bill be represented by 'x', then 0.6x is the cost of the heartworm check. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation as x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

This means the total bill for the vet visit is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John initially brought $125 with him. After spending $100 on the vet visit, he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To determine the total cost of the crate, we must first establish the cost of each individual fruit. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of a banana is $0.5 * 2 = $1.

Since oranges are the most expensive, their cost is three times that of a banana, resulting in $1 * 3 = $3 per orange.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective cost and summing these values.

The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Adding these costs together, we get $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we must first calculate the number of each color of squares. 

We are given that there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18. Furthermore, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24. Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, making the number of white squares 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is 68."
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the total number of chairs required. This can be calculated by summing the number of adults, babies, high chairs, and regular chairs.

Let's denote the number of high chairs as H and the number of regular chairs as R. We are given that H = 8 and that the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs (R = 5H). 

We can express the total number of chairs needed as: Total = H + 42 (adults) + 15 (babies)

Substituting R = 5H into the equation, we get: Total = 8 + 42 + 15 + 5(8)

Simplifying the equation, we get: Total = 8 + 42 + 15 + 40
Total = 105

Now, we can find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire by subtracting the number of high chairs from the total: Additional chairs = Total - H
Additional chairs = 105 - 8
Additional chairs = 97

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we must first establish the total number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5

= 25

Next, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks to identify the 8-point bucks. This can be calculated as:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we can start by calculating the points collected by each individual.

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. This can be calculated as 50 + (0.3 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, Tom's points can be calculated as 65 - 30 = 35 points. Then, Marta's points can be calculated as 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ a simple yet effective method. We start by identifying the number of children Great Grandma Jones has, which is given as 3. Each of these children then has 3 children of their own, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.

Since each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, we can calculate the total number of great grand-babies by multiplying the number of grandchildren by 3. This yields 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend after setting aside 50% of her paycheck for retirement and making her monthly car payment, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement. This is done by multiplying her total paycheck by 0.5, which gives us $1200.

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment. This is done by multiplying her total paycheck by 0.2, resulting in $480.

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck. This is calculated as $2400 - $1200 - $480, which equals $720.

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the total number of pencils present. Given that there are 20 spaces available and 4 pencils are missing, the total number of pencils can be found by subtracting the missing pencils from the total spaces.

Total pencils = 20 - 4 = 16

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Total pencils / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the total number of fireworks in the city and in her backyard.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, resulting in a total of 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate this as 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

In addition to the fireworks she can see from the city, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which amounts to 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard: 120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we must first calculate the total number of items required. With 14 individuals in the group, each requiring 2 drinks and 3 snacks, the total number of items can be found as follows:

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Given that each item costs $2, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the total number of items by the cost per item:

Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

Therefore, the group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by establishing the capacity of each truck. Let's denote Gissela's truck capacity as G, Gordy's truck capacity as G + 800, and Gary's truck capacity as G + 800 + x, where x represents the unknown capacity of Gary's truck.

We know that the sum of the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 8,800 pounds, as stated in the problem. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

G + (G + 800) = 8,800

Combine like terms:

2G + 800 = 8,800

Subtract 800 from both sides:

2G = 8,000

Divide both sides by 2:

G = 4,000

Now that we know Gissela's truck capacity, we can find the capacity of Gary's truck. Since Gordy's truck capacity is 800 pounds more than Gissela's, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 8,800 pounds. When Gary joins, the total capacity becomes 11,600 pounds. To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can utilize the information provided about the eating habits of the males and females. 

Given that each female consumed 3 dumplings and each male consumed 1 more than each female, we can establish that each male ate 4 dumplings. 

With 8 males in the group, the total number of dumplings consumed by males is 8 * 4 = 32. 

Concurrently, there are 6 females, and each of them ate 3 dumplings, resulting in a total of 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings consumed by females.

The combined total of dumplings consumed by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50. 

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the amount of money Gerald had left after spending $10, we first need to calculate his initial share of the $100. The ratio of Gerald's share to Julia's share is 3:2, which means the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share can be calculated by dividing his ratio by the total number of parts and multiplying by the total amount of money: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

After spending $10, Gerald is left with 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we must first establish the turtle's speed. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet per second

Next, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can start by finding the remaining amount they need to raise. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount already raised from the goal.

Remaining amount = Goal - Amount already raised
Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100
Remaining amount = $4200

Since the firefighters are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can find the hourly amount by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

Hourly amount = Remaining amount / Number of hours worked
Hourly amount = $4200 / 3 hours
Hourly amount = $1400 per hour

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to work by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly amount.

Total hours = Remaining amount / Hourly amount
Total hours = $4200 / $1400 per hour
Total hours = 3 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can start by finding the percentage of water used for industrial purposes. 

Given that the city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as follows:

80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we must first calculate the total number of days in this period. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would comprise 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Given that Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks can be calculated by multiplying the number of days by the daily rate: 14 days * $12 per day = $168.

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we can calculate the hourly production rates for each type of ice cream and then sum them up.

The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, resulting in a rate of 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour. Similarly, the vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, yielding a rate of 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts produced in 48 hours by multiplying the hourly rates by the number of hours and adding the results:

Total quarts from chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Total quarts from vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total number of quarts produced in 48 hours is the sum of these two values: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we must first determine the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can approach the problem by first calculating the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00 budget. Given that each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find the maximum number of scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal offered by the ice cream parlor is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This implies that for every 3 scoops Erin buys, she only pays for 2. To find the number of scoops she can afford under this deal, we can divide her budget by the cost of 3 scoops ($1.50 x 3 = $4.50).

$6.00 ÷ $4.50 = 1.33 (round down to 1, as we cannot purchase a fraction of a scoop)

Therefore, Erin should buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 2 scoops and 1 free scoop. This means she can get 3 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of days in the specified period. Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, resulting in a total of 3 * 14 = 42 pieces over the 14-day period.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two-thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 square foot bathroom, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom. This can be achieved by multiplying the total area by the fraction 2/3. 

The calculation is as follows: (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden requires 24 tiles per square foot, we can find the total number of tiles needed by multiplying the area to be covered (24 square feet) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

The calculation is as follows: 24 * 24 = 576.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine James' savings, we must first calculate the total cost of purchasing the blueberries at the store. The cost per pound is $2.5, and he picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

Next, we calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. James initially spent $20 on the initial cost, and then an additional $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds, resulting in a total cost of $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the amount James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we first need to determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. 

The original price of each computer was $700. To find the amount of the increase, we calculate 10% of $700:

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

The new price of each computer is the sum of the original price and the increase:

New price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers:

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we must consider the caloric contributions of each component. 

First, we calculate the calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories. 

Next, we determine the calories from the cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories. 

Lastly, we calculate the calories from the ham: 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

The total calories in the omelet can be found by summing the calories from each component: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet contains 770 calories."
"To determine the change, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3, and the cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2. Therefore, the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the total cost is $5 and the payment made was $10, the change can be calculated as $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Given that 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we can find this number by multiplying 100 by 0.3.

Number of people who receive interviews = 100 * 0.3 = 30

Next, we need to find the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of people who receive interviews by 0.2.

Number of people who receive a job offer = 30 * 0.2 = 6

Finally, we are told that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position. To find this number, we divide the number of people who receive a job offer by 3.

Number of people who accept the position = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, 2 people accept the position."
"To determine the total weight of rice Goldy gave away, we can employ a straightforward approach. We know that she initially had 20 sacks of rice and gave away a total of 7 sacks (3 to her cousin and 4 to her brother). Given that each sack weighs 25 kilograms, we can calculate the total weight of rice given away by multiplying the number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total weight of rice given away = Number of sacks given away * Weight of each sack
Total weight of rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack
Total weight of rice given away = 175 kilograms

Therefore, Goldy gave away 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother."
"To determine the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we can simply subtract the number of boxes she purchased last week from the number of boxes she purchased this week.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, for a total of 8 boxes. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. 

The difference in the number of boxes of cereal purchased this week and last week can be calculated as follows:

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we must consider the varying tap rates and the duration of each scenario.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute, resulting in a combined rate of 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps during this period is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, Helga's tap rate decreases to 200 taps per minute for each foot, resulting in a combined rate of 400 taps per minute. She dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, so the total number of taps during this period is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

To find the overall total, we add the taps from both scenarios: 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we must consider the total cost associated with the repair. This includes the damage to his car, the fine imposed by the city council, and the cost of the asphalt required for the repair.

The total cost of fixing the pothole can be calculated as follows:

1. Damage to the car: $450
2. Fine imposed by the city council: $120
3. Cost of asphalt: 3 buckets at $25 each, which equals $75

Adding these costs together, we get a total cost of $450 + $120 + $75 = $645.

Now, to find the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the fine from the total cost: $645 - $120 = $525.

Therefore, Ron saves $525 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is: $525"
"To determine the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we must first calculate the initial total number of chairs and then subtract the number of chairs sent for repair.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies, resulting in a total of 193 chairs.

Subsequently, 33 chairs (20 normal and 13 baby chairs) were sent for repair. To find the number of chairs left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total:

193 (initial total) - 33 (chairs sent for repair) = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices available. Since there are 5 individuals and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two of his friends consumed 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find the number of slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The remaining two friends consumed ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find the number of slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 = -20. However, since we cannot have a negative number of slices, this indicates an inconsistency in the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find the number of slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can first determine the rate at which each animal consumes the sausages. The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, so its rate is 9/30 = 0.3 sausages per minute. 

Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, the dog's rate is 0.3 * (2/3) = 0.2 sausages per minute.

The time it takes the dog to eat 9 sausages is 9 / 0.2 = 45 minutes.

To find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate the harmonic mean of their rates. The harmonic mean is given by 2 / ((1/r1 + 1/r2), where r1 and r2 are the rates of the cat and dog, respectively.

The harmonic mean is 2 / ((1/0.3 + 1/0.2) = 2 / (10/3 + 5) = 2 / (25/3) = 6/5 = 1.2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.2}$"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we must first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to a single unit. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Adding the additional 4 inches, we obtain a total length of 96 + 4 = 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed as an equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 90. Then, we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we must first calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, we can find the total number of windows by multiplying the number of cars by the number of windows per car. Given that there are 64 students' cars with four windows each, the total number of windows smashed for students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Similarly, for teachers' cars, we can find the total number of windows by multiplying the number of cars by the number of windows per car. With 32 teachers' cars having two windows each, the total number of windows smashed for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64.

The total number of windows smashed is the sum of the windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars, which is 256 + 64 = 320.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools by adding the quantities of light blue and dark blue spools. This yields 60 blue spools.

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing the quantities of all spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

Finally, we calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100: (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted, we can find this by multiplying 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Next, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we are told that by 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find the number of people who voted by 16:00, we multiply the remaining people by 2/3.

3000 * (2/3) = 2000

Finally, to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can employ a simple division operation. We divide the total number of days he wishes the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he consumes daily (4 pieces).

30 days ÷ 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since gum is typically sold in whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has sufficient gum for the entire duration. Therefore, he will require 8 packs of gum to meet his needs for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of s'mores needed. This can be achieved by summing the number of s'mores desired by the kids and the adults.

The number of s'mores for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18, while the number of s'mores for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6. Therefore, the total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers yields 8 s'mores, we can calculate the number of sleeves needed by dividing the total number of s'mores by 8. This results in 24 / 8 = 3.

As each box contains 3 sleeves, the number of boxes required is equal to the number of sleeves needed, which is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we are given that Dora's age is 15 years. We can use this information to find the age of her father and mother.

Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M. We are given the following relationships:

1. F = 2D + 8 (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
2. M = F - 4 (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)

We can substitute the expression for F from equation (1) into equation (2) to find M in terms of D:

M = (2D + 8) - 4
M = 2D + 4

Now, we can express the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother as:

Combined age = D + F + M
= D + (2D + 8) + (2D + 4)
= 5D + 12

We are given that D = 15. Substituting this value into the expression for combined age, we get:

Combined age = 5(15) + 12
= 75 + 12
= 87

Therefore, the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can employ the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of $20, which is to be divided equally among 4 individuals (Greg and his 3 younger siblings).

The division operation can be represented as:

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

This calculation yields a quotient of $5, indicating that each sibling, including Greg, will receive $5.

The final answer is $5."
"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we can calculate the weight of each category and then sum them up.

The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so the combined weight is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so its weight is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can calculate this as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, candidate C's votes can be calculated as:

Candidate C's votes = 100 - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)
= 100 - (20 + 30)
= 100 - 50
= 50 votes

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new total becomes 77 + 10 = 87 apples. 

To find the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we subtract Beck's new total from Boris's new total: 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transaction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water left, we must first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube. 

The giant cubes use 4 ounces per cube, and Peter makes 3 of them, resulting in a total of 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. The medium cubes use 2 ounces per cube, and he makes 7 of them, resulting in a total of 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. Lastly, the small cubes use 0.5 ounces per cube, and he makes 8 of them, resulting in a total of 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add the total water used for each type of cube: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's total as 2x.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16.

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we first need to establish the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Next, we calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost of 10-gallon jars is found by multiplying the cost of a gallon jar by 10, and the cost of 16 half-gallon jars is found by multiplying the cost of a half-gallon jar by 16.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Finally, we add the costs of the 10-gallon jars and the 16 half-gallon jars to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students who have expressed preferences for other activities. 

Given that there are 50 students in total, and 10 like to bake, we can subtract this number from the total to find the number of students who have not yet expressed a preference for baking. This leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 students.

We are also informed that 5 students prefer playing basketball. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who have expressed preferences for baking and basketball from the total number of students. This gives us 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

However, we must consider that the 10 students who like to play music are also included in the 40 students who have not yet expressed a preference for baking. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 40 - 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we first need to calculate the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the initial 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as follows:

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

This means that 4 birds were scared away, leaving 12 - 4 = 8 birds in the backyard.

Later, 20 more birds joined the backyard, increasing the total number of birds to 8 + 20 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we first need to establish the total number of students in each class. Given that the two classes have a combined total of 80 students and are evenly distributed, we can calculate the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.

80 ÷ 2 = 40

This indicates that each class has 40 students.

Next, we are informed that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can calculate 40% of 40.

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now, to determine the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, the plate contains 2 slices of cake. Mara then adds 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Subsequently, she triples the number of slices, leading to a total of 5 * 3 = 15 slices. After consuming 2 slices, the plate is left with 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Finally, her friend steals 5 slices, leaving the plate with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we must first calculate the total number of animals in need of grooming. This can be achieved by summing the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)
Total number of animals = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate Mark's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the packs he purchased. Since he bought 3 packs at $1800 each, the total cost can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total cost = Number of packs * Cost per pack
Total cost = 3 * $1800
Total cost = $5400

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. This includes the two cards worth $4000 and $1000, as well as 30 cards worth $50 each. We can find the total value of the 30 cards by multiplying the number of cards by the value per card:

Total value of 30 cards = Number of cards * Value per card
Total value of 30 cards = 30 * $50
Total value of 30 cards = $1500

Now, we add the values of the two high-value cards to the total value of the 30 cards to find the overall total value:

Total value = $4000 + $1000 + $1500
Total value = $6500

Finally, we calculate Mark's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value:

Profit = Total value - Total cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of each amusement park, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of adults and children by their respective fees and then summing the results.

For the first amusement park, the total cost is given by:
2 adults * $26 + 2 children * $12 = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the total cost is given by:
2 adults * $14 + 2 children * $10 = $28 + $20 = $48

To find the amount saved by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park:
$76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the vendor's weekly savings, we can calculate the difference in cost between the original and new vendor. 

The original cost per day is 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, resulting in a daily expenditure of 500 * 0.5 = $250. 

In contrast, the new vendor offers tomatoes at $0.4 each, leading to a daily expenditure of 500 * 0.4 = $200.

The daily savings can be calculated as the difference between the original and new costs: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 per week."
"To determine the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of marbles each individual possesses.

Given that Sean has 56 marbles and that he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can deduce that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. This can be expressed as:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Furthermore, since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the combined total of marbles Carl and Cal have, we add their individual totals:

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we must first recognize that the question is actually asking for the number of groups that are not already formed. Since the activity requires 12 groups and 54 students are to be separated into these groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups.

Number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups
= 54 / 12
= 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can conclude that the 54 students are already divided into 12 groups of 4.5 students each. However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, which is not applicable in this scenario. The 12 groups are already formed, and no more groups are required.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 0"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we must first calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then sum them.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200 chairs. 
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800 chairs.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000 chairs.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we can analyze the sequence of events that occurred.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. When Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas, Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

Subsequently, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, resulting in a total of 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, on the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, bringing the total to 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, on the third day, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity cost per roommate, we can calculate the monthly cost per roommate and then multiply it by 12.

The total electricity bill is $100 per month, and there are 4 roommates. To find the monthly cost per roommate, we divide the total bill by the number of roommates:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly cost per roommate by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$25 per month × 12 months = $300 per year

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we must first calculate the initial quantities and then account for the broken items.

Initially, Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which equates to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, he sent 4 dozen plates, resulting in 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Upon return, 10 glasses were found to be broken, and 6 plates were also damaged. To find the current quantities, we subtract the number of broken items from the initial quantities.

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we need to analyze the transactions step by step.

Initially, Lorraine possesses 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Consequently, she is left with 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Consequently, she is left with 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.

Lastly, she trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left, she trades them for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, we can calculate the total number of buttons she has at the end. She possesses 3 small stickers and 60 small stickers from the last transaction, totaling 63 small stickers. Additionally, she has 20 large stickers.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end is 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of matches played on each day: Monday (2 matches), Friday (1 match), and Saturday (double the number of matches played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches).

To find the total number of matches played, we sum the individual counts: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This relationship can be expressed as an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we obtain:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 11

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the number of votes in favor of the new regulation by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can utilize a systematic approach to calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of students needing size extra-small as x. We are given that 11 students need this size. 

Since twice as many students need size small as extra-small, the number of students needing size small is 2x, which equals 22.

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so the number of students needing size medium is 2x - 4, which equals 18.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so the number of students needing size large is (2x - 4) / 2, which equals 9.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of students needing size extra-large is 9 + 6, which equals 15.

Now, we can express the total number of shirts ordered as the sum of the students for each size: x + 2x + (2x - 4) + (2x - 4)/2 + 9 + 15.

Combining like terms, we get: 
x + 2x + 2x - 4 + x - 2 + 9 + 15 = 5x + 18.

Since we know that x = 11, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the total number of shirts ordered:
5(11) + 18 = 55 + 18 = 73.

The total number of shirts ordered is 73."
"To calculate the amount after the discount, we can use the formula: 

Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Marked Price

In this case, the discount percentage is 5% and the marked price is $140. 

Discount = (5 / 100) * 140
Discount = 0.05 * 140
Discount = 7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
Amount after discount = Marked Price - Discount
Amount after discount = 140 - 7
Amount after discount = 133

Therefore, the amount after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total duration of the playlists, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. 

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist, which yields 20 * 300 = 6000 songs. 

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song, which is 10 hours. This results in 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: 60,000"
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we can start by finding the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The remaining people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach. We are given that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of the Pomeranians are girls. We also know that there are six Pomeranian girls.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as an equation: P/3 = 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3, yielding P = 18.

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as an equation: 2/3 * Total Puppies = 18. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2, resulting in Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2 = 27.

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we must first calculate the amount of money Ava contributed to his initial funds. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 weekly allowance, we can calculate this as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Next, we add the initial amount Jayden had to the amount Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find the remaining amount he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to purchase the camera.

$85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles required for the third house, we must first establish the relationship between the cases needed for each house. 

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. According to the problem, the second house requires half of the total, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house, on the other hand, requires double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2x cases.

Since the total number of cases required for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation: x + 125 + 2x = 250.

Solving for x, we get 3x = 125, which yields x = 125/3. However, since we're looking for the number of cases for the third house, we can directly calculate 2x, which equals 2 * (125/3) = 250/3.

Therefore, the third house needs 250/3 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83.33}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we must calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

Leila's expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the number of cucumbers she purchased (3) by the cost per cucumber ($2), resulting in 3 * $2 = $6.

Similarly, Jack's expenditure can be determined by multiplying the number of tomatoes he purchased (5) by the cost per tomato ($1), yielding 5 * $1 = $5.

Lastly, Chase's expenditure is simply the cost of the head of lettuce, which is $3.

The total amount spent is the sum of these individual expenditures: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we can start by finding the number of pears he possesses. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of bananas by 1.45 (100% + 45% = 145%, or 1.45 as a decimal).

Number of pears = 1.45 * 200
= 290

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears:
Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears)
= 490

The final answer is 490."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the remaining amount of money after purchasing the ball. This is achieved by subtracting the cost of the ball from Marissa's initial amount of money.

Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Next, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars purchased.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To determine the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we must first establish the quantity of oranges required. Given that 5 kilograms of oranges are necessary for 1 liter of juice, the amount needed for 4 liters can be calculated as 5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms.

With each kilogram costing $3, the total expenditure for 20 kilograms of oranges is 20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice is $60."
"To determine the total number of books read, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed. It is given that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Let's denote the number of books read by Ahmed as 'x'. Therefore, the number of books read by Ezra would be 2x.

We are also given that Ezra read a total of 300 books in one hour. This can be expressed as 2x = 300. Solving for x, we find that x = 300 / 2 = 150. This implies that Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we can calculate the total number of books read by both individuals. Ezra read 300 books initially and 150 more, resulting in a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books. Adding the 150 books read by Ahmed, the total number of books read is 450 + 150 = 600.

The total number of books read is 600."
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we can break down her earnings into two components: the hourly wage and the daily bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, resulting in a total of 20 hours of teaching. At a rate of $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:

20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

Next, we need to consider the daily bonus. Since Tanya teaches more than 3 classes on Monday, she earns an additional $5 per day. This bonus is applied to both Monday and Wednesday, so we add $10 to her total earnings.

Total earnings for Monday and Wednesday = $300 + $60 (from hourly wage) + $10 (daily bonus) = $370

Therefore, Tanya's total earnings for the two days is $370.

The final answer is: $370"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.
The total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, the company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To determine the selling price per ear of corn, we can start by calculating the total revenue generated from the eggplants. With 20 eggplants sold at $3 each, the total revenue from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Given that Bennet aims to achieve a total revenue of $135, we can find the required revenue from the 25 ears of corn by subtracting the revenue from eggplants from the total target revenue: $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, to find the selling price per ear of corn, we divide the required revenue from corn ($75) by the number of ears (25). This yields $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total available time for leisure activities. Given that she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, the total available time is 12 hours.

Tatiana dedicates 3 hours to reading. To find the remaining time for other activities, we subtract the time spent reading from the total available time:

Remaining time = Total available time - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 - 3
Remaining time = 9 hours

Since Tatiana spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, we can calculate the time spent playing video games as follows:

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * Remaining time
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9
Time spent playing video games = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total available time:

Time spent playing soccer = Total available time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3
Time spent playing soccer = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total available time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon, which is half of his initial 50 pencils. This can be expressed as 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.

Next, we find the remaining pencils after giving 25 to Brandon. This is calculated as 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Then, we calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie, which is 3/5 of the remaining pencils. This can be expressed as 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.

Finally, we find the number of pencils Anthony kept by subtracting the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils after the first transfer. This is calculated as 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine the total time Jack is away from home, we must consider both the time spent traveling to the museum and the time spent at the museum itself.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack's speed is 75 miles per hour. We can calculate the time taken to drive to the museum as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

The total time spent driving is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time taken to drive back home:

Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total driving time = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, we get:

Total time away from home = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum
Total time away from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time away from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after Henry assembles the toys, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required. 

The number of wheels needed for the cars can be found by multiplying the number of cars (57) by the number of wheels per car (4), resulting in 228 wheels. Similarly, the number of wheels required for the motorcycles is obtained by multiplying the number of motorcycles (73) by the number of wheels per motorcycle (2), yielding 146 wheels. 

The total number of wheels needed is the sum of the wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles, which is 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box (650) to find the number of wheels left: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left is 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we can use the formula: 

Discount = (Discount Percentage * Original Price) / 100
Discount = (20 * 1000) / 100
Discount = 200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
Price after discount = Original Price - Discount
Price after discount = 1000 - 200
Price after discount = 800

Therefore, the price after a 20% discount is $800."
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the process into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series, which is one-third of the total collection. This can be found by dividing the total number of movies by 3:

600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies

Since Mike can acquire these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series if they were purchased individually. Given that a normal movie costs $10, the series would cost:

200 × $10 = $2000

However, Mike can acquire them for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, so we divide the cost by 6:

$2000 ÷ 6 = $333.33

Next, we determine the number of movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these remaining movies are older movies. We can calculate this as:

0.4 × 400 = 160 movies

Since these older movies cost $5 each, we can find their total cost:

160 × $5 = $800

Now, we calculate the cost of the remaining movies that are neither in series nor older movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

These movies cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. Therefore, their total cost is:

240 × $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

The cost of peaches is calculated by multiplying the weight (6 pounds) by the price per pound ($2.00), resulting in a total cost of $12.00. 

Similarly, the cost of plums is found by multiplying the weight (8 pounds) by the price per pound ($1.00), yielding a total cost of $8.00.

Lastly, the cost of apricots is determined by multiplying the weight (6 pounds) by the price per pound ($3.00), which gives a total cost of $18.00.

The total cost of the fruit is then the sum of these individual costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to their vacation spot, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to establish the relationship between their driving and hiking speeds. It is given that they hiked at an average speed 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Let's denote their driving speed as 'd' and their hiking speed as 'h'. We can express this relationship as:

h = (d/2) - 5

We are also given that their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

h = (50/2) - 5
h = 25 - 5
h = 20

Now that we have the hiking speed, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed * Time

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = h * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can establish variables for each of their respective scores. Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

Given that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, we can express this as E = A + 5. Additionally, since Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, we can represent this as E = 10A - 40. Lastly, the time it takes for each of them to finish the level is 4 seconds apart, with Emma completing the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so we can express this as E = 30 - 4 = 26.

We can now solve for A by substituting the first two equations into the third equation: 
A + 5 = 10A - 40
Subtracting A from both sides gives us:
5 = 9A - 40
Adding 40 to both sides gives us:
45 = 9A
Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:
A = 5

Now that we have Ava's score, we can calculate Emma's score using the equation E = A + 5:
E = 5 + 5
E = 10

The difference between their scores is A - E = 5 - 10 = -5.

The final answer is -5."
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. We start by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas that cost $30 from the total cost of $64.

$64 - $30 = $34

Since the remaining two pizzas have the same cost, we can divide the resulting amount by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

$34 ÷ 2 = $17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the usual days and the extra days.

Let's denote the number of times they ride on usual days as 'x'. Since they ride thrice a day for 5 days, the total number of times for these days is 3x. On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2x. 

The total number of times they ride in a week is the sum of the times for the usual days and the extra days:
3x + 2x = 5x

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can set up the equation 5x = 7 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get:
x = 7/5
x = 1.4

Now, we can find the total number of times they ride in a week by substituting the value of x into the equation 5x:
5 * 1.4 = 7

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 7 times a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish. However, this is not possible, so we will consider the alternative scenario where 14 orange fish and 3 white fish were taken out.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x. The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we will round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can't round down because the problem states that Bob bought some fish. Therefore, we will re-evaluate the problem.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption cost of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of working days is 5. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day.

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon.

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Finally, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week by multiplying the amount of gas consumed by the price per gallon, which is $3.

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the twenties she spent.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Additionally, Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is the sum of the amount spent on the twenties and the quarters, which is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we must first calculate the yield of each type of plant separately. 

Given that each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, the total number of tomatoes can be calculated as follows:

5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

Similarly, each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants. Therefore, the total number of eggplants can be calculated as:

8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

To find the total number of fruits, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together:

110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

Therefore, Ricardo can obtain a total of 142 fruits from his garden."
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can start by finding the combined total of smart and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The combined total of smart and analog TVs is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold can be found by subtracting the combined total of smart and analog TVs from the overall total: 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

Therefore, John is missing $150.

Final answer: $150"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the day and night. This can be found by subtracting the nighttime temperature from the daytime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log provides a 5-degree increase in temperature, we can calculate the required number of logs by dividing the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

However, since we cannot burn a fraction of a log, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house remains warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to calculate the number of groups participating in the scavenger hunt. Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by performing integer division.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups with seashells as follows:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we can apply the principles of set theory and basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125 people. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138. 

At the next stop, 38 people get off, resulting in 138 - 38 = 100 people remaining on the train.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Final answer: 100"
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day (10) by the number of days in the month (30) to determine the total number of bottle caps collected. This yields 10 * 30 = 300 bottle caps.

Next, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap, which is $0.25. This results in 300 * $0.25 = $75.

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which can be calculated as:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
For 3 hours, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first calculate the number of male lions. Since the number of male lions is half the number of female lions, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = Number of female lions + Number of male lions + Number of lion cubs
= 12 + 6 + 14
= 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. Given that the original price is $40 and the jeans are 25% off, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

The discounted price of the jeans is then $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

Remaining amount = $50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the concept of linear growth. The company starts with an initial workforce of 200 employees and adds 20 new employees each month.

The total number of employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

Since the number of employees grows linearly, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of employees after three months. However, in this case, we can simply multiply the number of months by the number of new employees per month and add the initial number of employees.

Total number of employees after 3 months = (20 employees/month) * 3 months + 200
Total number of employees after 3 months = 60 + 200
Total number of employees after 3 months = 260

The total salary paid per month is $4000 per employee, so the total salary paid after 3 months is:

Total salary paid after 3 months = 260 employees * $4000/employee
Total salary paid after 3 months = $1,040,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000.

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To determine the total duration of the caroling, we must consider the time allocated for each song. The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, with each rendition lasting 150 seconds. Consequently, the total time devoted to this song is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

In addition to ""Deck the Halls,"" the choir will also perform ""Jingle Bells,"" which lasts 240 seconds. Since they will only sing it once, the total time for this song remains 240 seconds.

To find the overall duration of the caroling, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we must first calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply these by the number of hours worked.

Initially, Billy's hourly wage was $10. Following a 2-month raise of $0.50 per hour, his wage increased to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Upon his first anniversary, he received a further $1.00 per hour raise, resulting in a wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, which was $10. Therefore, Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. As she also works 20 hours, her total earnings can be calculated as $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 - $10.50 * 20 = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 times the cost of one loaf, which is $2. Therefore, the total cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is simply 2 times the cost of one bagel, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's score and Nikita's score:
Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we must consider the contributions of both the students and the teachers. 

First, we calculate the number of trees planted by the students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Given that each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. This can be done by summing the number of each type of stuffed animal:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will then be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = -10.67

However, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a stuffed animal, we must re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to set up the equation as follows:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming sessions into two distinct periods. 

First, we calculate the total hours she played in the initial two weeks. Since she played for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days, the total hours played during this period can be found by multiplying the daily hours by the number of days: 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours she played in the subsequent week. She played for 2 hours per day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

The cumulative hours played so far is the sum of these two periods: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the distance separating the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since both cars are traveling at constant speeds, we can calculate the relative speed between them by finding the difference in their speeds.

Relative speed = Speed of the second car - Speed of the first car
Relative speed = 70 miles/hour - 60 miles/hour = 10 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance the second car travels relative to the first car in 2 hours:
Distance = Relative speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 hours = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must first calculate the premium. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we must first calculate the number of students who passed in each grade level and then divide that by the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500, which can be expressed as a fraction: 340/500. Simplifying this fraction yields 17/25. 

The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100, which can be expressed as a fraction: 40/100. Simplifying this fraction yields 2/5.

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, so it is 2 * (2/5) = 4/5.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed by adding the number of students who passed in each grade level: 17/25 + 2/5 + 4/5. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 25. We can rewrite 2/5 as 10/25 and 4/5 as 20/25. 

17/25 + 10/25 + 20/25 = 47/25.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed (47/25) by the total number of students in the school (500/25). 

(47/25) / (500/25) = 47/500.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (47/500) * 100 = 9.4%.

The final answer is: 9.4"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of glass chips available. Since Milo has two bags, each containing 72 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Given that it takes 12 chips to create one square inch, we can find the total number of square inches by dividing the total number of chips by 12. This yields 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo desires a mosaic that is three inches tall, we can calculate the length by multiplying the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 inches.

Therefore, Milo can create a mosaic that is 36 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, resulting in a total consumption of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Additionally, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, leading to an additional 16 * 2 = 32 quarts consumed.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea at the party can be found by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has. Initially, he had 100 candies and subsequently ordered an additional 100, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can calculate the total number of students at the end of the year and subtract the initial number of students.

Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can express this as an exponential function: 

Number of students at the end of the year = 10 * 2^12

Using the properties of exponents, we can simplify this expression:

Number of students at the end of the year = 10 * 4096
= 40960

Now, we subtract the initial number of students to find the additional students:

Additional students = 40960 - 10
= 40950

The final answer is: 40950"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and earned $105 in a week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch.

Total earnings: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we must first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

The total number of petals for each type of flower can be calculated as follows:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, we add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we must subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, we subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores John and DeSean can make with the remaining marshmallows, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows available after dropping 3.

Total marshmallows initially = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Marshmallows left = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is equal to the number of marshmallows left, which is 32.

However, they have already consumed 18 S'mores (9 each). To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to subtract the number of S'mores they've already made from the total number of S'mores they can make.

Number of S'mores left = 32 - 18 = 14

Since there are two individuals, we can divide the remaining S'mores by 2 to determine the number each can have.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we must first calculate the time each individual spent playing and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack's friend who is significantly worse than him as x. Since Jack plays for 4 hours (240 minutes), his friend plays for half that time, which is 120 minutes. The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so their playing time is 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes.

We can set up an equation to represent the total time played: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes. This equation represents the sum of the playing times of all four individuals.

Now, we can solve for x, the playing time of the friend who is significantly worse than Jack. We know that 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840, so we can set up the equation 240 + 120 + 120 + 1.5x = 840.

Simplifying the equation, we get 480 + 1.5x = 840. Subtracting 480 from both sides, we get 1.5x = 360. Dividing both sides by 1.5, we get x = 240.

Now that we know the playing time of the friend who is significantly worse than Jack, we can calculate the number of quarters used by each individual. Jack uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters, his friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters, and the better friend uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 quarters. Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 36 * $0.25 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"To determine the amount of oil used in Tanya's salt scrub, we can start by establishing the relationships between the various ingredients. Let's denote the amount of salt as x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest is also x ounces.

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces. Additionally, since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x ounces. However, we know that the amount of salt is x ounces, so we can set up the equation 2x = x, which implies that x = 0. This is a contradictory scenario, indicating that the initial assumption that the amount of salt is x ounces is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest is x, and the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of fragrance is also x.

So, the equation is: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats by multiplying the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

Finally, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall expenditure: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul needs to purchase, we can employ a simple subtraction operation. 

First, we must calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already possesses. This can be achieved by adding the number of chocolate cupcakes (8) to the number of toffee cupcakes (40). 

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Next, we subtract the total number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes required for the party (63). 

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already has) = 15

Therefore, Paul needs to acquire 15 additional cupcakes to meet the party's requirements."
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we establish the initial number of cars Joe has, which is twice the number of cars Robert has. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, we determine the number of cars Joe gives away, which is twice the number of cars he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, we calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after giving away 16 cars: 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can calculate the total amount raised by the students by subtracting the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can find the amount each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we must first calculate the time she spent walking on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we can calculate this as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

The total time walked in two days is the sum of these two values: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). Therefore, the total time in minutes is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we must consider the sequence of events. Initially, the parking lot contained 50 cars. Following the first break, 20 additional vehicles arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Subsequently, when Hunter exited the classroom for lunch, half of the total number of cars had departed. This equates to 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars leaving the parking lot. Consequently, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot at lunchtime can be calculated by subtracting the number of cars that departed from the total: 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week. Since he completes 30 cycles of work per day and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cycles per week is 30 * 7 = 210. 

Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks per week is 210 * 5 = 1050. Given that each task pays $1.20, John's weekly earnings can be calculated as 1050 * $1.20 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we must first establish the points scored by each player in each game.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Sasha in both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can calculate the total tins of each type by multiplying the respective number of packages by the number of tins per package.

For cat food, the total number of tins is 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

For dog food, the total number of tins is 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food can be found by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick's card count can be represented as 3x. Becca, having 12 more cards than Smendrick, can be represented as 3x + 12.

We are given that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have found PJ's card count, we can determine Becca's card count by substituting x into the equation 3x + 12:

Becca's card count = 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can analyze the given information. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following relationships between the colors:
1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P / 3

Substituting the given value of G into equation (2), we get B = 2 * 5 = 10.

Substituting the value of B into equation (3), we get P = 10 - 1 = 9.

Substituting the value of P into equation (4), we get Y = 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs of each color:
Total = G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is calculated as follows:
Weight-based shipping cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Mileage-based shipping cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's original price:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. Therefore, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Milly will lose $8."
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. She purchased two pairs of jeans at $30 each, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. The total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Mulan initially had $40, and after making the purchases, she is left with $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

$60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can analyze the given information. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. Subtracting this from the total monthly production gives us 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we must first calculate the time she dedicates to each activity and then sum these values.

Britany records 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours.

In addition to recording, Britany spends 2 hours per week writing amateur songs and 1.5 hours per week doing her makeup. 

The total time spent on TikTok per week is the sum of these values: 1.2 hours (recording) + 2 hours (writing songs) + 1.5 hours (doing makeup) = 4.7 hours.

To find the total time spent on TikTok in a month, we multiply this weekly value by the number of weeks in the month: 4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we must first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items separately.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we subtract the number of standard items from the number of additional items for each category:

- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the cost of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can start by establishing the amount saved by each individual. It is given that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as $20 + $10 = $30.

Given that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate 40% of Anthony's savings by multiplying $30 by 0.4, which equals $12. Adding this 40% to Anthony's savings, we obtain Roy's total savings: $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we must first establish the relative lifting capacities of each individual. We are given that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay. Furthermore, Saskay can lift a mountain twelve times higher than Pompei, who can lift a mountain of 1 inch.

We can begin by finding the height Saskay can lift. Since Saskay can lift a mountain twelve times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we can determine the height Kagiyami can lift. As Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift 12 inches, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, we can calculate the height Naruto can lift. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift 48 inches. Therefore, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour and he travels for 4 hours initially, followed by an additional 6 hours, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time

For the first 4 hours, the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours, the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances covered in both periods:
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total Distance = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the speed of a single kangaroo. Since three kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Given that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can calculate the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since the distance remains constant, we can use the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway to find the distance.

Time for kangaroos = 18 hours
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 6 hours × 18 hours
Distance = 108 miles

Now, we can find the time it will take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Time for turtles = 108 miles / 3 hours
Time for turtles = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take four turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as 'x'. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes made by Rory can be expressed as x + 20. Jada, on the other hand, makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes made by Jada can be represented as 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes, we get:

- Rory's dishes: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
- Jada's dishes: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2 * 40 = 80

Now, we can calculate the total number of dishes made by adding the individual counts:

Total number of dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can analyze the situation by breaking it down into steps.

First, we know that the original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, resulting in a new price of $600 - $200 = $400. This is the amount she needs to cover after trading in her old laptop.

Erika has received $150 for her part-time job and her mom has agreed to give her $80. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 230 from both sides of the equation:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately. 

The number of slices from 3 large apples is 3 * 5 = 15. Similarly, the number of slices from 5 small apples is 5 * 3 = 15. 

The total number of slices is the sum of these two, which is 15 + 15 = 30. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can set up a proportion based on the amount of milk each cow produces per day. 

Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the following equation:

5 * 3 = 15 (current milk production)
5 * x = 25 (target milk production)

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

However, this calculation only accounts for the milk production of the additional cows needed. Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to add the number of cows he currently has to the result:

x = 5 + 3
x = 8

Therefore, the farmer needs 8 cows in total to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used. 

Let's start by finding the length of each glue stick that is not used. For the first glue stick, 5/6 of 12 mm is 10 mm, so 1/6 of 12 mm is 2 mm. 

For the second glue stick, 1/3 of 12 mm is 4 mm, so 2/3 of 12 mm is 8 mm. 

For the third glue stick, 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm, so 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we can calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase and subtract the amount he currently possesses.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the car and the cost of the phone: $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5,200.

To find the amount Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we can calculate the difference between the total amount she paid and the cost of the hat. 

The total amount paid is equivalent to four $20 bills, which equals $80. The cost of the hat is $70. 

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount he spent. He acquired 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equates to $40. 

Craig then purchased 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 x $2 = $12. Additionally, he bought 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to an additional expenditure of 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of these expenditures: $12 + $9 = $21.

To find Craig's remaining funds, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

$19"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of socks and dishes each person has. Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes he has as D. We are given that Jack has 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this relationship as D = 2S. Substituting D = 60, we get 60 = 2S, which implies S = 30.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can express the number of socks Peter has as 2S, which is 2(30) = 60 socks.

Additionally, we are told that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is D/2 = 60/2 = 30 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes each person has: 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 120.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To determine the total number of students good at math, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B. We're given that T = 20, M = 5 (good at math only), and E = 8 (good at English only). We're tasked with finding M.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that the total number of students is equal to the sum of students good at math and students good at English, minus the number of students good at both, to avoid double-counting. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

T = M + E - B

Rearranging the equation to solve for B, we get:

B = M + E - T

Substituting the given values:

B = 5 + 8 - 20
B = 13

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M = M + B
M = 5 + 13
M = 18

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we must first calculate the total available time for performances. The concert lasts for 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. 

Each group's performance time includes a 2-minute setup, a 6-minute performance, and a 2-minute teardown, totaling 10 minutes per group. 

The total available time for performances is 120 minutes. To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the total available time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time taken by each group
= 120 minutes / 10 minutes
= 12

Therefore, 12 groups can perform in the concert.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300 and the annual interest rate (r) is 3/4 or 0.75, we can plug in the values to get:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years."
"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we must first calculate the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. This can be determined by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars by subtracting the latter from the former: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of trays that can be filled with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

Dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray yields:

900 ÷ 30 = 30

This result indicates that the farmer can fill 30 trays. To find the total earnings, we then multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray, which is $2.5.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of goats remaining in each farm after the sales.

Let's denote the initial number of goats in Farm X as x and the initial number of goats in Farm Y as y. We are given that x = 55 and y = 45.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, resulting in a new number of goats in Farm X: x - 10 = 55 - 10 = 45.

He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which equates to 2 * 10 = 20 goats. Therefore, the new number of goats in Farm Y is y - 20 = 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats remaining in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can utilize the formula for average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this scenario, we have the total annual expenditure on shoes ($2640) and the number of pairs purchased per year (2).

First, we calculate the total number of pairs purchased over the course of a year. Since James buys 2 pairs per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs purchased annually is 2 * 12 = 24 pairs.

Now, we can calculate the average cost per pair by dividing the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs purchased:

Average cost per pair = Total annual expenditure / Total number of pairs purchased
= $2640 / 24
= $110

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs of each type of food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we must account for the $2 discount per basket. Therefore, the total cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. After applying the discount, the cost becomes $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms that constitutes one-half of the total. 

Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three parts.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the ages of the individuals involved as variables. Let's use 'x' to represent the age of the person in question, 'x + 3' for the brother's age, 'x - 2' for the sister's age, and '3(x + 3) - 1' for the mother's age.

The sum of their ages is given as 87, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the age of the person in question is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to purchase, we can employ the concept of division and rounding. 

First, we divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). This yields a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 3. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student receives the desired amount of glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The correct answer is 4."
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Initially, the river receives 4000 gallons of water. On the second day, the amount of water doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add this increase to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. The number of infected people on each day can be represented by the equation:

Number of infected people on Day n = 10 * (6^(n-1))

where n is the number of days.

For Day 1:
Number of infected people = 10 * (6^0) = 10

For Day 2:
Number of infected people = 10 * (6^1) = 60

For Day 3:
Number of infected people = 10 * (6^2) = 360

For Day 4:
Number of infected people = 10 * (6^3) = 2160

"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, resulting in a total of 40 * $20 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can calculate her share by finding 90% of Rafaela's total. This can be done by multiplying Rafaela's total by 0.9. 

$800 * 0.9 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given away. Since Jennifer gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, the total number of oranges given to the daughters is 3 x 2 = 6. Additionally, she gave 3 oranges to her son. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To determine the number of badges each girl earns in a year, we can analyze their individual badge-earning rates.

Claire's badge-earning rate is 1 badge per month, resulting in 12 badges per year.

Amber's badge-earning rate is 1/2 of Claire's rate, which is 0.5 badges per month. Therefore, Amber earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges per year.

Wendy's badge-earning rate is 3 times Claire's rate, which is 3 badges per month. Consequently, Wendy earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges per year.

To find the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount raised, we first need to determine the total number of banana bread slices produced. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she worked for 5 hours, the total number of loaves is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Given that each slice is sold for 50 cents, the total amount raised can be calculated by multiplying the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

Therefore, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Solving for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins to be 40, we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we must first calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students. 

Given that there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos distributed can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos distributed = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos distributed = 50 * 10
Total burritos distributed = 500

Next, we must account for the burritos consumed by Mr. George. 

Total burritos consumed = Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George
Total burritos consumed = 20

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total burritos consumed from the total burritos distributed:

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos distributed - Total burritos consumed
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink, we must first establish the number of green and blue cars. Given that the rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as 12 - 2 = 10.

Furthermore, the number of blue cars is three times the number of green cars, which yields 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

With the total number of cars being 75, we can now calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 (total) - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x, Anne has as y, and Sofie has as z.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as z = y + 25. Additionally, we know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write y = x - 12.

The total number of books they have together is 85, which gives us the equation z + y + x = 85. We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for x.

Substituting z = y + 25 and y = x - 12 into the equation z + y + x = 85, we get:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combining like terms yields:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtracting 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, substituting y = x - 12 into the equation 2y + x = 60, we get:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expanding the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combining like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Adding 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we first need to calculate the number of boxes required. Given that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups and Greg wants to provide each of the 30 kids with 4 jello cups, we can calculate the total number of cups needed as follows:

Total cups needed = Number of kids * Number of cups per kid
Total cups needed = 30 * 4
Total cups needed = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we can find the number of boxes required by dividing the total cups needed by 10:

Number of boxes needed = Total cups needed / 10
Number of boxes needed = 120 / 10
Number of boxes needed = 12

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box:

Total cost = Number of boxes needed * Price per box
Total cost = 12 * $1.25
Total cost = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the phones. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of phones by the price per phone: 5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the seller: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we must first calculate his monthly expenditure. Given that Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which amounts to $400 per month, and Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure as follows:

Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
= $400 - (60% of $400)
= $400 - 0.6 * $400
= $400 - $240
= $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can then calculate Keenan's weekly expenditure by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4:

Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
= $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we can break down his consumption into three segments.

First, we calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he consumed 2/5 of the total 60 pieces, we can find this value by multiplying 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

Next, we consider the 10 pieces he ate on the second day. This is a straightforward subtraction from the initial total.

60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining

Now, we calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. He consumed 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find this value, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Finally, we sum the pieces he ate each day to find the total number of pieces consumed.

24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda can be found by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 3 * $21.00 = $63.00.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the soda and the cost of the water: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03, and David intends to acquire 16 bolts. Therefore, the total cost of the bolts can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we can subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David possesses to determine the amount left:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total cost
Remaining amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts."
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we must first calculate her hourly wage. This can be achieved by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours worked: $33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Next, we multiply her hourly wage by the total number of hours she plans to work: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him 28 marbles. This can be done by adding the initial number of marbles (52) to the number of marbles his friend gave him (28), resulting in 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. This can be calculated by multiplying 80 by 1/4, which equals 20 marbles.

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles Paul lost (20) from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the additional marbles (80). This results in 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine Amy's total score, we must calculate the points earned from each type of question and sum them together.

First, we calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since each question is worth 1 point and Amy answers 80% of them correctly, we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.8 * 10 = 8. Therefore, Amy earns 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, we calculate the points from the true/false questions. Each question is worth 1 point, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. We can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.9 * 20 = 18. Thus, Amy earns 18 points from the true/false questions.

Lastly, we calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Each question is worth 5 points, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. We can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.6 * 5 = 3. Therefore, Amy earns 3 points from the long-answer questions.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points earned from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we first need to calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and intends to sell 3/5 of them, we can find this number by multiplying 300 by 3/5.

Let's calculate 3/5 of 300:
(3/5) * 300 = 180

Next, we know that Isaias sells each chicken for $50. To find the total revenue from selling 180 chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:
180 * 50 = $9000

Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he sold must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

To find the cost per chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold:
$7000 / 180 = $38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to establish the number of glasses sold by Micah. Since the total number of glasses sold is 32 and Julie sold 14 glasses, the remaining glasses were sold by Micah and Mitchell in equal numbers. 

We can find the number of glasses sold by Micah by dividing the total number of glasses sold by 3 (the number of people selling lemonade). 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we must first calculate the cost of each service. 

The cost of the hair service is $400. 

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which can be calculated as 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which can be calculated as 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we can find the total amount Iris spent at the spa by adding the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure together: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The cost of the new rope can be calculated by multiplying its length (20 meters) by the cost per meter ($1.5). This yields a total cost of $30.

Sarah's initial amount of money can be calculated by multiplying the length of the rope (20 meters) by the cost per meter ($2). This results in an initial amount of $40.

To find the amount of money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from her initial amount:

$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

In 16 years, her age will be x + 16. According to the problem, this age should be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation:

x + 16 = 3x

To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:

16 = 2x

Now, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 8

This means Melanie is currently 8 years old. 

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. We know that thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we must first calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart. 

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12. 

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can utilize algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert can be expressed as 2x. Additionally, we know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the equation representing the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. We start with the initial number of toys Argo had, which is 200. Then, we subtract the total number of toys he gave away, which is the sum of 40, 80, and 30.

Initial number of toys = 200
Toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Therefore, Argo now has 50 toys.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we can calculate the number of chimichangas made on each day and then sum them up.

The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on these two days, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we can find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days by adding the number of chimichangas made on each day: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs. This can be calculated by finding 20% of the total number of microphones.

20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. Therefore, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

To find the number of pairs, we divide the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we must consider the various groups of birds he observes. 

First, we note that there are six birds nesting in the bushes. Then, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead by taking two-thirds of the number of birds in the bushes, which yields 4 birds. 

Next, we calculate the number of birds feeding by multiplying the number of groups (3) by the number of birds in each group (8), resulting in 24 birds.

Finally, we sum the number of birds in each group: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of cookies consumed from the initial total.

Let's denote the initial number of cookies as 'x'. The number of cookies remaining is then x - 5.

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we can divide the remaining cookies by 5 to find the number of cookies in each jar.

x - 5 ÷ 5 = (x - 5) / 5

Given that Lani initially baked 55 cookies, we can substitute x = 55 into the equation:

(55 - 5) / 5 = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we can calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be found by multiplying the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

Similarly, the total number of petals on the daisies can be found by multiplying the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to calculate the number of indoor and outdoor plants. 

We know that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants. This can be calculated as 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of these are outdoor plants, which can be calculated as 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x meters per second. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Equating the two expressions for the whatchamacallit's speed, we have 11x = 121. Solving for x, we find x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second. 

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of a single carrot, we must first calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3. 

The combined cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Given that Ellen's total expenditure is $11, we can find the cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total expenditure: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

$2"
"To determine Mark's new weekly earnings, we must first calculate his updated hourly wage. This can be achieved by adding the $2 hourly raise to his original wage of $10.

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Next, we multiply the new wage by the total number of hours Mark works in a week. Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total hours worked per week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

$12 (new wage) * 40 (hours per week) = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to establish the total earnings from lawn mowing. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Consequently, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Given that Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total earnings from lawn mowing can be expressed as 6x. We are informed that the total earnings from lawn mowing amount to $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

Solving for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we cannot mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can calculate the number of times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total earnings from lawn mowing can be calculated as:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

To find the amount she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the total earnings from lawn mowing from the overall amount she made:
702 - 80 = 622

The final answer is: 622"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can analyze the given information step by step. 

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, we can calculate Carl's weight as 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Lastly, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, which gives us 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we must first calculate his total monthly earnings. Since he rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, the total number of hours worked is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. Given that he earns $25 per hour, his total monthly earnings can be calculated as 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Next, we need to subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit. Therefore, his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between their notebook collections. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph initially had as x. Since Martha had three times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express this relationship as 3x.

Given that Martha ended up with a total of 7 notebooks after purchasing 5 additional notebooks, we can set up the equation 3x + 5 = 7 to represent the total number of notebooks she now possesses.

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, yielding 3x = 2. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 2/3.

Now, we can calculate the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph by subtracting Joseph's initial amount from Martha's current total. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph initially had 2/3 of that amount. Therefore, the difference is 7 - 2/3 = 7 - 0.67 = 6.33.

The final answer is: 6.33"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can start by calculating Anis's distance. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express Anis's distance as a fraction of Dijana's distance. 

Let's represent Dijana's distance as 'x'. Then, Anis's distance can be represented as x + (1/5)x, which simplifies to (6/5)x.

We are given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis's distance by substituting the value of x into the expression (6/5)x:
Anis's distance = (6/5) * 50
Anis's distance = 60

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we can add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each of Susan's nephews will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by her husband. This involves subtracting the number of cookies taken from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to determine the number each will receive.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies."
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can analyze their reading patterns.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, while Daniel read 13 pages. This establishes a baseline for their individual reading habits.

On the second day, Denise read 5 more pages than the number Daniel read the previous day. Since Daniel didn't read any pages on the second day, we can calculate Denise's total as 13 (Daniel's pages from the previous day) + 5 = 18 pages.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read by each individual:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we must first establish the total capacity of the pot in terms of the number of bowls it can fill. The pot can fill either four adult-sized bowls or eight child-sized bowls. Given that there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total capacity of the pot is four bowls.

Subsequently, we must account for the bowls that will be consumed during dinner. Since there are four adults, four bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

Now, we can calculate the remaining bowls available for lunch by subtracting the bowls consumed during dinner from the total capacity. 

4 (total capacity) - 4 (bowls eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are two children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine the total amount William spent, we can calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks can be found by multiplying the number of notebooks by the price per notebook: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 

The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

Therefore, William spent a total of $8."
"To determine the total material required, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can produce 4 masks. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Solving for x, we get:
x = (2 yards * 20 masks) / 4 masks
x = 10 yards

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can produce 3 masks. Using a similar approach:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Solving for x, we get:
x = (2.25 yards * 8 masks) / 3 masks
x = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can utilize the formula for average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this scenario, the total amount spent on tickets is $216, and the total number of tickets purchased is 27.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours available in a day. There are 24 hours in a standard day.

Harold's daily activities can be broken down into three categories: sleep, work, and dog walking. He sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours (2 hours less than his sleep time), and spends 1 hour walking his dog.

The total time spent on these activities is the sum of their individual times: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (dog walking) = 19 hours.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 (total hours) - 19 (total activity time) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To determine the number of blue and red shoe boxes left, we must first calculate the number of each type of box used. 

The number of blue shoe boxes used is given as 3. The number of red shoe boxes used is 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes. Since there are 9 red shoe boxes in total, we can calculate the number used as follows:

Number of red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we can find the number of red shoe boxes left by subtracting the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:

Number of red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

Similarly, we can find the number of blue shoe boxes left by subtracting the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes:

Number of blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:

Total number of shoe boxes left = 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can start by calculating the initial number of books he had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial number of books Joseph had = 2 * 9
= 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had:

Current number of books Joseph has = Initial number of books - 2
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to calculate the fraction of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. Since he gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, we can find this amount by multiplying 1/5 by the total number of marbles Dean initially had, which is 30.

1/5 * 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles Dean gave to Donald to this amount:

6 + 10 = 16

Finally, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount to find the number of marbles Dean has left:

30 - 16 = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can express this relationship as:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Therefore, Adam's current age is 30. To determine Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is 38."
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since it is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let x be the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm. Then, the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm is 2x + 100. 

We know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so we can substitute x = 200 into the equation for Farmer Smith's farm: 2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the acres of both farms: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 per hour, his hourly rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages.

With an 8-hour workday, Colby completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Given that he receives $0.20 for each package, his total daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks during the time spent on sudoku puzzles, we must first calculate the total time spent on both puzzles. 

The time for the normal sudoku puzzle is 45 minutes, and the time for the extreme sudoku puzzle is 4 times that, which equals 180 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes. 

Number of bottles of water = Total time / 30 minutes = 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are also given that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

2R + 3Y = 58 (total bologna pieces)
R = 20 (number of red balloons)

Substituting R = 20 into the first equation, we get:

2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y by subtracting 40 from both sides:

3Y = 18
Y = 18 / 3
Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day period. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total miles driven in 30 days can be calculated as follows:

Total miles driven = miles driven per day * number of days
Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can find the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total miles driven by 1000:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day period."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, resulting in 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours worked over the three days can be found by adding the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the initial amount of allowance given to Julia and Nadine, we must first calculate the total amount they spent on the items they purchased. The total expenditure on a cake and 2 tubs of ice cream is $11 + $7 = $18. Additionally, they spent $6 on 1 dozen balloons.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the initial amount each girl received.

$24 / 2 = $12.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12."
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we must first calculate the initial total. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of each fruit: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Subsequently, we subtract the number of fruits Lola consumed from the total to find the remaining quantity: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of students, we must consider the number of students participating in each sport. 

First, we calculate the number of students playing volleyball, which is twice the number of students playing tennis. Since there are 6 students playing tennis, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is the sum of boys and girls, 16 + 22 = 38.

Finally, we sum the number of students in each sport to find the total number of students: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to determine the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops sold by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Next, we find the profit per lollipop by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $0.8 (selling price) - $0.5 (cost price) = $0.3 (profit per lollipop).

Finally, we calculate the total profit by multiplying the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 lollipops * $0.3 (profit per lollipop) = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information provided and calculate the number of each type of pet.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9. Additionally, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7.

Furthermore, Larry's fish tank contains three times the number of fish as rabbits, resulting in 3 * 7 = 21 fish. Lastly, his collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, which equals 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we must first establish the daily consumption rate of each individual. Abby consumes 2 slices per day, while Josh consumes twice as much, resulting in a daily consumption rate of 4 slices.

The combined daily consumption rate is the sum of their individual rates: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

To find the number of days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption rate (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression. Since Martha collects one shell per month, the sequence of the number of shells collected forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.

The number of months Martha has been collecting shells can be calculated as follows:

10 (years) - 5 (years) = 5 years
5 years * 12 (months/year) = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells:

Total shells = 60 months

Therefore, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first establish the total number of mint tea cups. Given that Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea can be calculated as follows:

Total cups of mint tea = Total cups - Total cups of cinnamon tea
Total cups of mint tea = 27 - 15
Total cups of mint tea = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, we can determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row by dividing the total number of mint tea cups by 3:

Number of cups of mint tea in each row = Total cups of mint tea / Number of rows
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 12 / 3
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 4

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we must first establish the total time available for foraging. The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries.

Given that each round trip (down and back up the tree) takes 4 hours, the sloth can make a maximum of 8 / 4 = 2 round trips within the given time frame.

Since the sloth collects the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total desired berries (24) by the number of round trips (2) to find the minimum number of berries collected per round trip.

24 / 2 = 12

Therefore, the sloth must collect at least 12 berries per round trip to meet the 24-berry target within the 8-hour time frame.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial water in the tank = (1/2) * 10000 gallons = 5000 gallons

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the amount of water remaining after 6 days, we can subtract the total amount emptied from the initial amount:

Remaining water = Initial water - (Rate * Time)
= 5000 gallons - (500 gallons/day * 6 days)
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

Therefore, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days."
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we must first calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses of popcorn and candy. His monthly allowance is $150, and he has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, resulting in a remaining budget of $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Given that it is a Friday, Colby wishes to purchase a movie ticket, which costs $10. After subtracting this expense from his remaining budget, he is left with $134 - $10 = $124.

To determine the maximum number of movies Colby can attend, we divide his remaining budget by the cost of a single movie ticket. Since the ticket costs $10, we can calculate this as follows:

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

However, since Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a movie ticket, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total calories of the pastries, we must first calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then sum them together.

A normal cinnamon roll contains 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since there are 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from these pastries are 200 x 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin contains 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since there are 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from these pastries are 300 x 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is the sum of the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85,000}$"
"To determine the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we must first calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period. 

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Therefore, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days, which is 300 / 5 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can calculate the distance each vehicle covered using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.

For the bus, the distance traveled is 60 miles per hour multiplied by 5 hours, resulting in 300 miles.

For the car, the distance traveled is 30 miles per hour multiplied by 8 hours, resulting in 240 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car can be found by subtracting the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48.

Next, we subtract this total from the current number of toys: 62. This yields the number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's start by analyzing the given information. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can represent their ages as P, P + 10, and J, respectively. 

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's ages, so we can write the equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P - P = 10 + J

This simplifies to:

0 = 10 + J

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

45 = (45 + 10) + J

Simplify:

45 = 55 + J

Subtract 55 from both sides:

-10 = J

Since age cannot be negative, this is a problem. However, let's re-examine the original equations.

We can rewrite the first equation as:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

45 = (45 + 10) + J

Simplify:

45 = 55 + J

Subtract 55 from both sides:

-10 = J

Since age cannot be negative, this is a problem. However, let's re-examine the original equations.

We can rewrite the first equation as:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the initial number of balloons. Since Maria and her 4 friends each received 2 water balloons, the total number of balloons is 5 * 2 = 10. Additionally, Maria had 1 balloon for herself, bringing the total to 10 + 1 = 11 balloons.

Next, we consider the additional balloons provided by Maria's mom. Each person, including Maria, received 3 more balloons. With 5 people in total, the additional balloons amount to 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial and additional balloons: 11 + 15 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available for display. This can be achieved by adding the boxes donated by the 10 individuals to the existing boxes owned by the charity group.

The total number of boxes is 10 people * 5 boxes/person + 10 boxes = 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2.

Number of tables = Total boxes / 2 = 60 boxes / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already possesses 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed.

New tables required = Total tables needed - Existing tables = 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated items."
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we must first calculate the total distance each individual spits their seeds. 

Zoey's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (40) by the distance each seed is spat (10 feet): 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (35) by the distance each seed is spat (12 feet): 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both individuals is the sum of their individual distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we must first calculate the total number of widgets produced by each device in a 30-day period.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, resulting in 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets per day. Over 30 days, this amounts to 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets. Given that each widget sells for $6, the total revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000 in 30 days is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

In contrast, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, yielding 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets per day. Over 30 days, this translates to 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets. With each widget selling for $6, the total revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 in 30 days is 32,400 * 6 = $192,000.

To find the difference in earnings between the two machines, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we first need to calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for this period.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost of the additional hours is calculated by multiplying the number of hours by the hourly rate of 70 pesos. Therefore, the cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours, which is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we compare the cost of the extended stay to the cost of the 24-hour stay. The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. Therefore, Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first calculate the individual hay requirements for each type of livestock. 

Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

The amount of hay each sheep requires is 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep requires 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay required is the sum of the hay needed for goats and sheep, which is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we first calculate his total earnings. Given that he earns $50 per hour and worked for 6 hours, his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total Earnings = Hourly Wage * Hours Worked
Total Earnings = $50 * 6
Total Earnings = $300

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings to find the amount available for other expenses:

Available Funds = Total Earnings - Cost of Gas
Available Funds = $300 - $50
Available Funds = $250

Subsequently, we calculate the total cost of the pencils purchased:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * $10
Cost of Pencils = $50

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from the available funds to determine the amount remaining:

Remaining Funds = Available Funds - Cost of Pencils
Remaining Funds = $250 - $50
Remaining Funds = $200

Lastly, we calculate the number of 25-dollar pens John can purchase with the remaining funds:

Number of Pens = Remaining Funds / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = $200 / $25
Number of Pens = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can calculate the total number of letters in each of their word lists separately.

Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This implies that the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig's brother is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, which is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: $\boxed{650}$"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. The number of children in each row is given as 8, and there are 7 rows in total, each representing a different school.

The total number of children can be calculated by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows. This is a basic application of the multiplication principle.

Total number of children = Number of children in each row * Number of rows
Total number of children = 8 * 7
Total number of children = 56

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we must first calculate the total number of bottles distributed to the students. With 29 pupils in the class and each student receiving 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given away is:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we consider the teacher's available coupons, which amount to 9 in total. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the maximum number of bottles the teacher can obtain is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Subtracting the number of bottles distributed to the students from the maximum number of bottles the teacher can obtain yields the number of bottles left for the teacher:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To determine the total cost of the job, we must consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. The fixed charge is $40, and the labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). This yields a labor cost of $78.75.

The total cost is then the sum of the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine James' financial outcome, we must first calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. The cost of 10 CDs at $15 each is 10 * $15 = $150.

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 40% of $150. This can be found by multiplying 0.4 and $150, resulting in a discount of $60.

The total cost after the discount is then $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sells 5 CDs for $40 each, generating a total revenue of 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount: $90 - $200 = -$110.

Therefore, James was out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total value of each type of crop and then sum them up.

The value of the yams can be calculated by multiplying the number of yams (6) by the price per yam ($1.5), resulting in a total value of $9. 

Similarly, the value of the sweet potatoes is obtained by multiplying the number of sweet potatoes (10) by the price per sweet potato ($2), yielding a total value of $20.

Lastly, the value of the carrots is found by multiplying the number of carrots (4) by the price per carrot ($1.25), giving a total value of $5.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Jen will earn by adding the values of the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the total time James spends on the entire journey, we can break down the problem into distinct segments.

First, we calculate the time James spends swimming at a pace of 2 miles per hour. The total distance he needs to cover is 20 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Next, we find the distance James covers at this speed, which is 60% of the total distance. This is calculated as follows:

Distance = Total distance * 0.6
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

The time spent swimming this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half the time he spent swimming. Therefore, the rest time is:

Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Finally, James covers the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

The time spent swimming this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time James spends on the entire journey is the sum of the swimming times and the rest time:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can start by calculating seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. This can be represented as 7 * 70.

7 * 70 = 490

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we can find the total number of loaves by subtracting 40 from 490.

490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can analyze the sequence of events. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net gain of 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

Subsequently, her teacher rewarded her with 5 additional stickers for her efforts in helping her classmates. This increase in stickers can be calculated by adding 5 to the net gain of 8, yielding a final total of 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To determine Cayley's total commission, we must first calculate the commission earned from each newspaper and then sum these amounts.

The commission for the New York Times is found by multiplying the number of copies sold (6) by the commission rate (10% or 0.1) and the cost per copy ($5). This yields:

6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Next, we calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal by multiplying the number of copies sold (10) by the commission rate (8% or 0.08) and the cost per copy ($15):

10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Finally, we add the commissions earned from both newspapers to find the total commission:

$3 + $12 = $15

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can utilize the given information that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. This implies that Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can express this relationship as an equation: Marcus's age = 0.5 * Leo's age. Substituting the known values, we get 21 = 0.5 * Leo's age.

To solve for Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, yielding Leo's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score can be represented as x + 20. Given that Bahati scored the most points, we can express Azibo's score as (x + 20) - 10, which simplifies to x + 10.

We know that the total points scored by the three individuals is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now that we have found Dinar's score, we can determine Azibo's score. Since Azibo scored 10 points more than Dinar, Azibo's score is x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15.

Therefore, Azibo scored 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must consider the fact that each paper is printed on both sides. This implies that the number of pages per inch is twice the number of pages per inch, as each side of the paper contains one page.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

Number of pages per inch = 2
Thickness of the book = 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
= 2 * 1.5
= 3

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we must first determine the total duration of time he was stapling reports. The time interval from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM can be broken down into two segments: 4 hours (from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) and 11 hours (from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM).

Converting these time intervals to minutes, we have 240 minutes for the first segment and 660 minutes for the second segment. The total duration is the sum of these two segments: 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by dividing the total minutes by 15. This yields:

Total reports = 900 minutes / 15 minutes per report = 60 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 60 reports during the specified time period."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim's usual sleep duration is 8 hours, which is equivalent to 480 minutes. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to attend to her bathroom needs. Therefore, we need to subtract these 5 minutes from her total sleep time.

Next, we need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time.

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours and 45 minutes
Converting this to minutes, we get 3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes + 45 minutes = 225 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time she spent sleepwalking. To do this, we need to find the time she went to sleep and subtract it from her usual sleep time.

Kim's usual sleep time is 10 p.m. - 6 a.m. = 6 hours, which is equivalent to 360 minutes. We already calculated that she went to sleep at 2:15 a.m., which is 225 minutes before her usual wake-up time. 

360 minutes - 225 minutes = 135 minutes

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We can calculate the duration of this period as follows:

2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Now, we can add this to her total sleep time:

135 minutes + 23 minutes = 158 minutes

Finally, we need to add the 5 minutes she woke up earlier than usual to her total sleep time:

158 minutes + 5 minutes = 163 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial quantities of measuring cups and spoons. We are given that Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons by multiplying 2/3 by the number of measuring cups. This gives us:

(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and spoons:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

1/5 of 1000 beds = 200 beds

Next, we need to account for the daily admissions due to the coronavirus outbreak. With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the additional admissions:

200 beds + 700 beds = 900 beds

To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity:

1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds."
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can start by establishing the relationship between Shawna's and Aliya's ages. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Next, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5, as Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we must first calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported. This can be done by multiplying Courtney's reported number by 0.20.

0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Next, we subtract this value from Courtney's reported number to find the actual number of attendees.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a logical approach by establishing a relationship between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls can be represented as 2x. Similarly, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls can be expressed as 2(2x) or 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, which allows us to set up the equation 2x = 2. Solving for x, we find that x = 1. This implies that Jeffrey carried 1 ball, and Jordan carried 4 balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by each individual: Total balls = x + 2x + 4x = 7x. Substituting x = 1, we get Total balls = 7(1) = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 4 * (number of holes dug on the fourth day) = 29 + (number of holes dug on the fourth day).

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. Then, the equation becomes 4x = 29 + x.

To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation: 3x = 29.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 29/3.

x = 9.67

Since the number of holes dug must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot dig a fraction of a hole. However, in this case, the answer is not an option in the provided format, but we can infer that the correct answer is the closest whole number, which is 9 or 10.

Given the options, the closest answer is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we can utilize the information provided to establish an equation. Let's denote the number of corn chips each of the two individuals (Amora and Lainey) received as 'x'. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than the others, the number of corn chips Collins received can be expressed as (x + 15).

We are given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

3x + 15 = total number of corn chips

Since we know Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, we can substitute 70 for x + x:

3(70) + 15 = total number of corn chips

Simplify the equation:

210 + 15 = total number of corn chips

Combine the constants:

225 = total number of corn chips

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To determine the total cost of the travel, we can calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of the supplies: 0.5 * $400 = $200. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, which can be expressed as:
X = S + 5

Furthermore, we are told that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, giving us the equation:
S = 4A - 13

Substituting the expression for X into the first equation, we get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Substituting S = 4A - 13 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combining like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we have found A, we can determine S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes by dividing the total minutes per episode by 2.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we can multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the bird's journey into three segments and calculate the total distance traveled in each direction.

The bird's initial 10-hour journey south at a speed of 30 miles per hour results in a distance of:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then reverses direction and travels 2 hours north at a speed of 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

Finally, the bird changes direction once more and travels 5 hours south at a speed of 22 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had, we must consider the individual contributions from each source. 

She initially prepared 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. This can be expressed as 12 individual brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 1/2 a dozen is equivalent to 6 brownies.

Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. Again, 4 dozen is equivalent to 48 individual brownies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of brownies by adding the brownies from each source: 12 (initial) + 6 (office party) + 48 (friends' contribution) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were consumed. To convert 1 1/2 dozen to a decimal, we divide 1.5 by 1 (since 1 dozen = 12), which equals 1.5. Multiplying 1.5 by 12 gives us 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total: 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten brownies) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that Nani is 8 years old. Since his brother is twice his age, we can calculate his brother's age as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. Given that she is 25% younger than Nani, we can express this as an equation: sister's age = Nani's age - (25% of Nani's age). Converting 25% to a decimal, we get 0.25. So, the sister's age is 8 - (0.25 * 8) = 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can calculate the total age by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we can calculate the time for each type of string and add them together. 

First, we need to calculate the time for each type of string. The time for synthetic gut racquets is 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes. The time for polyester racquets is 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes. Lastly, the time for hybrid racquets is 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time by adding these values together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{227}$"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, the cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13. This yields 20 players for Zeke's team.

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in each team: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be found by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats required.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence."
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she initially possessed. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we need to account for the oranges she distributed to her mom and sister. Since she gave 2 boxes to each of them, the total number of oranges given away is 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

We then calculate the number of oranges she retained, which is 1/4 of the total: 1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Subtracting the oranges she kept and the ones given away from the initial total yields the number of oranges she sold: 240 oranges - 40 oranges - 60 oranges = 140 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we must first establish the number of states in the United States of America. The USA has 50 states.

Next, we need to calculate half of this number. Half of 50 is 25.

Since India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states in India.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting his savings from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

To find the number of hours Tyler must work, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage, which is $5. Thus, the number of hours he must work is $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we can first establish the number of cherries Richard possesses. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can calculate the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries (60) and Robert's cherries (30) from the total:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we must first calculate the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on each day.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, resulting in 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. Additionally, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, which equates to 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box. Therefore, the total earnings for each day can be calculated as follows:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings from Saturday and Sunday: $60 + $90 + $90 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total number of hours she will be outside. Given that she spends 4 hours per day outside for 8 consecutive days, the total duration can be calculated as follows:

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, the total number of bottles required can be found by dividing the total hours by the bottle capacity:

Total bottles = Total hours / 8 ounces per bottle
Total bottles = 32 hours / 8 ounces per bottle
Total bottles = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the prices of both cars, we can use the concept of percentages. The problem states that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means the price of the red car is 60% of the price of the blue car, as 100% - 40% = 60%.

Given that the price of the blue car is $100, we can calculate the price of the red car by multiplying the price of the blue car by 0.6 (which represents 60% of the price).

Price of the red car = 0.6 x $100
= $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60, and the price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that Emil is currently 19 years old, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, which can be expressed as the equation 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 yields D = 48.

Additionally, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, leading to the equation 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2 results in B = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12). To find the sum of their ages, we add the three ages together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can analyze the information provided. 

First, we know that her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. 

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which can be calculated as 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so we can calculate this as 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we can find the total number of beads by adding the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we must first calculate the cumulative amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught by adding the amounts from each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can determine the number of servings by dividing the total amount by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of students who are not football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, the remaining students constitute 80% of the class. 

We can calculate this as 0.8 * 30 = 24 students.

Next, we find 25% of these remaining students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band. This can be calculated as 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders or band members, which is 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we must first establish the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average shoe size by adding the sizes of their boots and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

The length of the bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between each plant, we subtract this from the total length: 1332 - 18 = 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find the total number of plants Pat can fit: 1314 / 12 = 109.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to purchase 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can start by finding the daily consumption of his brother. Since Edgar's brother consumes half the amount of pretzels that Edgar does, we can calculate this by multiplying Edgar's daily pretzel intake by 1/2.

Edgar's daily pretzel consumption is 18 pretzels. Therefore, his brother's daily consumption is:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels/week

The final answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we must calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then sum them.

The cost of petunias can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of petunias per basket (3) and the cost per petunia ($3.00). This yields 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be determined by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of vines per basket (2) and the cost per vine ($2.50). This results in 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of these two values: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds, and for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for both is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since the total amount of soil purchased is 30 pounds, the remaining amount available for planting roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Given that each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings for shoes. This can be found by multiplying her monthly income by the percentage she sets aside for shoes.

Monthly savings = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply her monthly savings by 12 to find her annual savings.

Annual savings = $500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we can divide her annual savings by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can afford.

Number of shoes = $6,000 / $1,000 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the process into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking.

First, we need to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp peeled per minute
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp cooked per minute
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 3
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we add the time it takes for each task to find the total time:

Total time = Time to peel 90 shrimp + Time to cook 90 shrimp
Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes
Total time = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the final temperature, we must consider the net cooling effect of the air conditioner. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. 

First, we calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner. It ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it ran on high for 4 hours, resulting in an additional cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Next, we consider the warming effect of the room. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour, and it was off for 2 hours, resulting in a warming effect of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. 

We can set up the equation: 
Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * (Bill's dad's age at the first sighting)
Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can express Bill's age at the second sighting as 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

We also know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is x. We can set up the equation: 
x + 75 = 90

Solving for x, we get x = 15.

Now, we can find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet: 30 + 15 = 45 years old.

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can calculate Bill's age at the first sighting: 3 * 45 = 135 years old.

However, this is Bill's age at the second sighting. To find his age at the first sighting, we need to subtract 75 years: 135 - 75 = 60 years old.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each check type. 

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, a check for his gas bill once per month, and two checks per month to the church. Additionally, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which translates to four checks per year.

We can calculate the total number of checks per month by adding the frequency of each type of check: 1 (electric bill) + 1 (gas bill) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

To find the total number of checks per year, we multiply the monthly total by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year.

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we must first establish the total number of flights it makes in a day. Since the second plane's 44 trips constitute half of the first plane's total, we can deduce that the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane's flights are divided into three categories: flights to Greece, flights to France, and flights to Germany. We know that it makes 66 flights to Greece, which accounts for three-quarters of its total flights. To find the remaining flights, we subtract the flights to Greece from the total: 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, we can determine the number of flights to France by dividing the remaining flights by 2: 22 / 2 = 11.

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves howl, we must first calculate the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl lasts 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, resulting in a howl duration of 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

The total duration of their howls is then 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, yielding 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents. 

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To determine the age of Wilfred, we can start by utilizing the given information. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We know that the average age of the group is 5, as the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children.

Given that Helene is twice the average age, we can express this as H = 2 * 5, which simplifies to H = 10.

We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4, respectively. The sum of their ages is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total age of the group: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20. Substituting H = 10, we get 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we have 17 + W = 20. Solving for W, we find that W = 20 - 17 = 3.

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we must first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected. This can be found by adding the initial $500 collected from his neighbors to the $1500 collected from the online fund, yielding a total of $2000.

However, it's essential to note that Walter's friend will be contributing $200 to the cause, which should be subtracted from the total amount collected. Therefore, the adjusted total is $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Given that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount donated by everyone else, we can calculate the lawyer's contribution by multiplying the adjusted total by 3. This results in 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies available for distribution. Since each of the 100 guests brought 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door as a gesture of gratitude. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. This results in 750 / 15 = 50.

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we must first establish the total number of slices. Given that there are 6 individuals in the family, consisting of 2 adults and 4 children, and each adult receives a slice twice the size of each child, we can denote the number of slices allocated to the children as x. Consequently, the number of slices allocated to the adults is 2x.

Since the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 2

Thus, the number of slices allocated to the children is 2, and the number of slices allocated to the adults is 2x = 4.

As each adult slice is twice the size of a child's slice, let's denote the size of a child's slice as y. Consequently, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all slices, which is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we divide the size of the adult slices (4y) by the total size of the watermelon (10y) and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, each adult receives 40% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

The time spent on inpatient rounds can be calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients (9) by the time spent per inpatient (20 minutes), resulting in 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments by multiplying the number of appointments (10) by the time spent per appointment (30 minutes), yielding 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is then the sum of these two values: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available (9 hours) to find the time left for updating records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we must consider the total time required for each step in the process. 

The time needed to prepare the cake batter is 20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes for baking, 2 hours for cooling, and an additional 10 minutes for frosting. 

Converting the cooling time to minutes yields 120 minutes, which, when added to the other times, results in a total of 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we obtain 180 minutes, which is equivalent to 3 hours. 

Subtracting the total time from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm, we find that Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can approach this problem algebraically. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5 boxes, resulting in 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. This can be expressed as an equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combining like terms, we get:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the rental costs and the costs associated with the students' lessons. 

First, let's calculate the total monthly rental cost. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the monthly rental cost is $25 * 3 * 4 = $300.

Next, we need to calculate the total monthly cost of the students' lessons. The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 4 = $60.

Now, we can find the total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month by adding the monthly rental cost and the monthly cost of the students' lessons. The total expected earnings are $300 + $60 = $360.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360.

$360"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can set up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so her total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x. 

For Peter's equation: x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha's equation: x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha. The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines. Given that the female porcupine population is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50
= 3 * 10
= 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120. 

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is given by:

Volume = Length x Width x Height

Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so:

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we must first establish the quantities of each color. We are given that there are 9 red sticks. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. Furthermore, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which results in 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

The total number of sticks can be calculated by summing the quantities of each color: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can calculate the distance each of them covered by multiplying their respective speeds by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo can be found by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information provided.

First, we calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this age group.

Next, we find the number of male students over 16. Given that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we calculate 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we find 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

Now, we can determine the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Similarly, we find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Finally, we calculate the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps each individual can run, we can analyze the given information. 

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can calculate Trey's lap count as 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Next, we're told that Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so her lap count is 14 / 2 = 7 laps. 

Lastly, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, resulting in a lap count of 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in lap count between Bethany and Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can break down the problem into two parts: the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Meanwhile, Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. Consequently, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save up the down payment, we can calculate her total weekly earnings and then divide the desired savings by this amount.

Janet's total hourly wage is $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the desired savings by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits. 

The cost of peaches is 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of pears is 4 x $0.75 = $3
The cost of kiwis is 2 x $1 = $2
The cost of apples is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we can find the amount of money he has left by subtracting the total amount spent from his initial amount: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this result is not feasible in this context, as it implies a negative amount. 

To proceed, we should re-evaluate the initial calculation. The correct approach is to subtract the total amount spent from Jamaar's initial amount of $10.

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.

The remaining number of packs she gave away is 15 - 2 = 13. Given that each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away (780) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received. 

780 / 10 = 78

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. The price increase is 5% of the original price each year, which can be represented as a geometric progression.

The formula for exponential growth is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount, r is the growth rate (as a decimal), and n is the number of years.

In this case, the initial price (P) is $120, the growth rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years (n) is 3.

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A ≈ 139.74

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means each album contains 9 pictures. Given that 3 albums were selfies only, we can calculate the number of selfies as:

3 * 9 = 27

Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, we can calculate the number of portraits as:

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies."
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can establish a ratio of pages to time. Given that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing the total time by the number of pages:

Time per page = Total time / Number of pages
Time per page = 10 minutes / 3 pages
Time per page = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can calculate the total time James spends reading by multiplying the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads:

Total time = Time per page * Number of pages
Total time = 3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages
Total time = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. However, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. Then, 15 guests opted for a late checkout, reducing the number to 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, the number of guests who checked in is twice the number of those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in during the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

The final number of guests at the hotel is 98."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday, which is triple the number he picked on Wednesday. This can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Next, we add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

Therefore, John has a total of 22 bananas."
"To determine the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions.

Given that 40% of the 60-question quiz are easy, we can calculate the number of easy questions as follows:
60 * 0.4 = 24

The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so we divide the remaining questions by 2:
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x and the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We are also given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Therefore, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 3x * y, and the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y.

The total revenue from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation:

3x * y + 8y = 120

Since we know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, we can substitute 3x with 3 * 4 = 12. This gives us:

12y + 8y = 120

Combining like terms, we get:

20y = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we find:

y = 6

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total daily consumption by summing the individual daily consumption of the man, his wife, and their son. This yields a total of 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches consumed in a week is 11 * 7 = 77.

The family consumes 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total income. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, yielding 80 * $1 = $80. Additionally, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, resulting in 60 * $4 = $240. 

Combining these earnings, we find that her total income is $80 + $240 = $320. 

Subsequently, Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, totaling 2 * $10 = $20. 

To find her remaining earnings, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total income: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we must first account for the eggs discovered by the Smith twins. Since there are 100 eggs in total and the twins found 60 of them, we can subtract this amount from the overall total to find the remaining eggs.

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by twins) = 40 eggs

However, it is stated that all the eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This implies that the 10 unaccounted eggs were not found by the friends. Therefore, to find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the 10 unaccounted eggs from the remaining eggs.

40 (remaining eggs) - 10 (unaccounted eggs) = 30 eggs

Thus, the friends found 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we must first establish the individual daily ore production rates for each type of pickaxe.

Let's denote the amount of ore mined by a dwarf with bare hands as 'b', the amount mined with an iron pickaxe as 'i', and the amount mined with a steel pickaxe as 's'. We are given that b = 12 pounds per day.

We also know that the dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so i = 2b = 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.

Furthermore, it is stated that the dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. This implies that s = 1.5i = 1.5 * 24 = 36 pounds per day.

With 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40s = 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a month, which is 30. Therefore, the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. 

Let's denote the unknown cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We can set up a proportion using the given information:

(2 sandwiches) / $3 = (4 sandwiches) / $6 = (8 sandwiches) / x

Since the prices are proportional, we can equate the ratios:

(2/3) = (4/6) = (8/x)

We can simplify the second ratio: (4/6) = (2/3)

Now, we can equate the first and third ratios:

(2/3) = (8/x)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2x = 3 * 8
2x = 24

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment, we first need to calculate the remaining amount owed after Tom uses the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and after selling his old bedroom, he has $1000. Therefore, the remaining amount owed is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount owed. This can be done by multiplying the remaining amount by 0.10.

Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Since 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, we can find this value by multiplying 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. Therefore, 10 red balloons were lost.

Next, we need to find the number of red balloons remaining. We subtract the number of burst balloons from the initial number of red balloons: 25 - 10 = 15.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released when Sally accidentally dropped half of them. Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were lost.

Now, we determine the number of yellow balloons remaining by subtracting the number of lost balloons from the initial number: 12 - 6 = 6.

We are also informed that 8 blue balloons were caught in a tree. Sally then adds 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. Therefore, 6 blue balloons were added to her collection.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red, yellow, and the newly added blue balloons: 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can employ the concept of complementary probability. This involves finding the probability of the complementary event (i.e., Marcus not having to turn in his homework) and subtracting it from 1.

The probability of the normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension is 60% (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension). The probability of the substitute teacher coming in is 50%. Therefore, the probability of neither of these scenarios occurring is (1 - 0.6) * (1 - 0.5) = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2.

Now, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios where Marcus does have to turn in his homework: 0.6 (normal teacher with no extension) + 0.5 (substitute teacher with no extension) = 1.1. However, this is incorrect as probabilities cannot exceed 1. We must reconsider our approach.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios where he doesn't have to turn it in: (1 - 0.4) * 0.5 (normal teacher with no extension) + 0.5 * (1 - 0.6) (substitute teacher with no extension) = 0.6 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.

Now, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework: 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50%.

Final answer: 50%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of seats taken by the graduates and faculty. 

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we can calculate the total number of seats taken as follows:

Total seats taken = 950 (graduate seats) + 300 (faculty seats) = 1250

Now, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to find the remaining seats:

Remaining seats = Total capacity - Total seats taken
= 6000 - 1250
= 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive:

Tickets per graduate = Remaining seats / Number of graduates
= 4750 / 950
= 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = M/3.

Substituting the value of M, we get S = 150/3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we must first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her daily expenses. 

Melissa's daily income is $15, and her daily expenses are $3. Therefore, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she works for 6 hours a day for 3 days, the total number of hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find her total jury pay, we multiply her daily income after expenses by the total number of hours worked: $12 * 18 = $216.

Finally, we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing her total jury pay by the total number of hours worked: $216 ÷ 18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the books and pencils separately and then summing the results.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each can be calculated as 3 * 16 = 48 dollars. Similarly, the cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we can find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the books and pencils: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time required for Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward approach. The key is to calculate the total number of bottles he can accommodate along his driveway and then multiply this number by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

Given that the driveway's width is 24 feet and a bottle is placed every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between bottles
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to make 7 movements to reach the last bottle. Each movement takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time required can be calculated as:

Total time = Number of movements * Time per movement
= 7 * 5 seconds
= 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples and then divide it by the number of apples in each pack.

Given that there are 40 apples in one box and Uncle Franky has two boxes, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, the number of packs can be found by dividing the total number of apples by 8. Therefore, the number of packs is 80 / 8 = 10.

The correct answer is 10."
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased. 

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $11 = $22. Similarly, the cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor initially had $50. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school, we need to consider the total amount of money he lost during his four-year college tenure and the increase in his income after graduation.

The total amount of money Jim lost during his college years is $200,000, which is the sum of the annual loan amount ($50,000) and the lost income ($150,000, calculated as $25,000 x 4). 

After graduating, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year. To find the time it would take him to earn the total amount of $250,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$250,000 / $75,000 = 3.33 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 3.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric required, we must first calculate the dimensions of the comforter. Given that the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet by 8 feet, we can derive the fabric dimensions as follows:

The length of the comforter is 6 + 2 = 8 feet, and the width is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the fabric by multiplying the length and width:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. This is equal to one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday, plus 17. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. Therefore, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. This is equal to twice the number delivered on Tuesday, plus 5. Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. Therefore, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Finally, we add the number of letters delivered on each day to find the total: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad can be calculated by multiplying the number of people who want it (10) by the cost per person ($6.50), resulting in a total of $65. Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is found by multiplying the number of people who want it (6) by the cost per person ($6), yielding a total of $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is the sum of these two costs, which is $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To determine the average amount lost by Johnny, we must first calculate the total amount lost over the three races. 

In the first race, he incurred a loss of $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This can be calculated as 2 * $5 + $1 = $11. 

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This can be calculated as 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, we can calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To determine the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward multiplication principle. We start by multiplying the number of countries in South America (26) by the number of cities in each country (5), which yields 130. Then, we multiply this result by the population of each city (1000), resulting in a total population of 130,000.

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we must first convert their heights to a common unit, such as inches. Xavier's height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. Therefore, his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can calculate the difference in their heights by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To determine the amount the first person took, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can start by converting the fraction of the day to hours. 

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Next, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days worked, which is 7 days per week. This gives us a total of 9 hours/day * 7 days/week = 63 hours.

Finally, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter. There are 4 painters, so we divide 63 hours by 4 painters to get 15.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is then x + 4, and the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. We can express this as an equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combining like terms yields:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we have found x, we can determine the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^t

where:
A = final value
P = initial value ($20,000)
r = annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21)
t = number of years (3, since 2010 is 3 years after 2007)

A = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20,000(0.79)^3
A = 20,000(0.631441)
A = 12,688.82

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,688.82.

$12,688.82"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can start by calculating the total number of non-Spanish books. Since half of the books are written in English, we can calculate this as 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

Next, we need to find the number of books written in German. Given that 10% of the books are in German, we can calculate this as 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we can find the total number of non-Spanish books by adding the number of English and German books: 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 non-Spanish books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books can be found by subtracting the number of non-Spanish books from the total: 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can employ a simple subtraction operation. 

The total distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York, is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers. 

To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance:

1955 (total distance) - 325 (distance driven) = 1630 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion. Given that Ingrid consumes 8 cups of water daily, we can calculate the total amount of water she drinks in 30 days by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days.

First, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to obtain the total cups of water consumed in 30 days:
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we convert the total cups to gallons by dividing the result by 16, as there are 16 cups in a gallon:
240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can analyze the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, the train has 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. This results in a net increase of 100 - 50 = 50 people. Adding this to the previous total, we get 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, reducing the total to 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we must calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

The tank top costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price, resulting in a cost of $48 / 2 = $24. Additionally, Alison purchased a package of athletic socks for $8, from which she had a $2 discount, leaving her with a cost of $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by adding the costs of all items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400.

"To calculate the total yearly cost of James' insurance, we first need to determine the increased cost due to the accident. This can be found by taking 60% of the normal monthly cost and adding it to the normal cost.

The normal monthly cost is $120. To find 60% of this amount, we multiply $120 by 0.6.

$120 * 0.6 = $72

Now, we add the increased cost to the normal cost to find the total monthly cost.

$120 + $72 = $192

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost.

$192 * 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we must first calculate the number of loads per week. Since Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, and his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin sets) + 1 (king set) = 3 loads.

Given that there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year can be calculated by multiplying the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

The total number of movies watched in one weekend is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4. Therefore, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'x'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as 'x + 3'. Given that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can represent Silvia's slices as '2x'.

We are also provided with the information that Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 7

Now that we have found the value of 'x', we can determine the number of slices each person ate:

Jake's slices = x = 7
Becky's slices = x + 3 = 10
Silvia's slices = 2x = 2 * 7 = 14

To find the total number of slices they ate, we can add up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Jake's slices + Becky's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 7 + 10 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we must calculate the cost of each service and sum them together.

The cost of the cast is $200. The cost of the visit can be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate ($300) by the number of hours spent at the clinic (0.5 hours, since the visit is 30 minutes). This yields $150. Additionally, the cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and 30 pills were prescribed, resulting in a total cost of $120. Lastly, the cost of parking is $6 per hour, and the minimum required parking time is 2 hours, resulting in a total cost of $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the percentage of emails that require a response. Given that 20% of his emails don't require a response, the remaining percentage of emails that do require a response is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Next, we can calculate the number of emails that require a response by multiplying the total number of emails James receives in a day (80) by the percentage of emails that require a response (80% or 0.8). This gives us 80 * 0.8 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily number of emails he responds to (64) by the number of days in a work week (5). This yields 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we can calculate the number of classes that visited each day and sum them up.

"To calculate the average score, we must first sum up all the scores and then divide by the total number of tests. In this case, John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80.

The sum of these scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Since there are 4 tests, we divide the total score by 4 to find the average: 380 ÷ 4 = 95.

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we must first calculate the number of small and big coupons being sent out. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, we can express this as:

Number of big coupons = 2 * Number of small coupons
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700
Number of big coupons = 1400

Now, we can calculate the total cost of postage by multiplying the number of each type of coupon by its respective cost and adding them together:

Cost of small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
Cost of small coupons = 700 * 0.05
Cost of small coupons = 35 dollars

Cost of big coupons = Number of big coupons * Cost per big coupon
Cost of big coupons = 1400 * 0.15
Cost of big coupons = 210 dollars

Total cost of postage = Cost of small coupons + Cost of big coupons
Total cost of postage = 35 + 210
Total cost of postage = 245 dollars

The total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Mark then consumed 4 of these, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Subsequently, Sidney ordered an additional 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches can be calculated by multiplying the total number of sub sandwiches by the number of meatballs per sub sandwich: 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that were unable to deliver the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * Total number of trucks dispatched
= 1/4 * 20
= 5

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

To find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered, we subtract the amount that could not be delivered from the total amount:
Total amount of fertiliser delivered = Total amount of fertiliser dispatched - Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered
= 20 trucks * 20 tons
= 400 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 400 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we must first calculate the total amount of butter required. Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store is currently offering a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This implies that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs to purchase, we divide the total amount of butter he requires (6 pounds) by 2. This results in 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we first need to calculate the number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people declined the invitation. 

The total number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

The rental fee for the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. To find the cost for the additional guests, we subtract the base number of guests from the total number of guests: 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $125 (base rental fee) + $126 (cost for additional guests) = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To determine the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 30.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $30. 
1/4 * 30 = 7.5

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $30. 
1/3 * 30 = 10

The total amount of money they spent is 7.5 + 10 = $17.5.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
2x - 17.5 = 2(30) - 17.5
= 60 - 17.5
= $42.5

The two of them have $42.5 left."
"To determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey, we must first calculate the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys. 

The first monkey consumes 10 bananas per day, while the second monkey consumes 4 more bananas than the first, resulting in 14 bananas per day. 

The total daily consumption of the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas.

Given that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the remaining bananas for the week are 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the remaining bananas by 7 days: 147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we must consider the information provided. It is stated that he finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which equates to 250 pieces. Additionally, he completed another 500-piece puzzle within the same hour.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces placed during this hour, we can add the number of pieces from both puzzles: 250 (from the first half of the 500-piece puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750."
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we must first calculate the total cost of the roses. 

The cost of 15 roses can be found by multiplying the number of roses by the cost per rose: 15 * $2 = $30. Additionally, we can calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses by multiplying the number of roses by the cost per rose: 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost of the roses is then $30 + $6 = $36.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has: $25 - $36 = -$11. However, since she cannot receive a negative amount of change, we must re-evaluate the situation.

Given that the florist only accepts quarters for change, we can calculate the maximum number of quarters she can receive with $25. Since $25 / $0.25 = 100 quarters, she can receive up to 100 quarters. However, she is short $11, so she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

$0"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we can calculate the total sales from each item and add them together. 

First, we'll calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33. 

Next, we'll calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we'll calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30.

Now, we'll add these amounts together to find the total sales: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to analyze the train schedule and calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means the time from its arrival to departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. Since the third train leaves immediately after its arrival, its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we first need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far. This can be done by multiplying the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Next, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find the number of toothpicks she still needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find the number of additional weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we first need to calculate the original price of the watch. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Next, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend. We can do this by finding the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then dividing by the original price. However, since the sale price is higher than the original price, we need to consider the actual discount as a percentage of the sale price.

Sale price = $3200
Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the sale price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Sale price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $3200) * 100
Percentage discount = -16.67%

Since the percentage discount cannot be negative, we can consider the absolute value of the result:

Percentage discount = |-16.67%| = 16.67%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 16.67%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16.67}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can start by calculating the rate at which a single spring produces jellyfish. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, its hourly production rate is 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

Multiplying this rate by 4 hours yields 240 jellyfish produced by a single spring in 4 hours. 

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours can be found by multiplying the number produced by one spring in 4 hours by 5. This gives us 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Frankie's score as F and Binkie's score as B. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This can be expressed as:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we must consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

Given that James' home is 4 miles from the store, and he walked halfway, the total distance he walked is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time it took him to reach the store as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we must first calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of buying bananas individually is calculated as follows: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can approach the problem algebraically. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as x. Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 20

This means Sam receives 20 feet of fence. To find the amount left over for Sam, we subtract his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year.

The formula for linear growth is:

Total growth = growth rate * number of years

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its respective price.

First, we can calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold, which is half of the total bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, we can calculate the number of BMX bikes sold, which is 15% of the total bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, we can calculate the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

With the number of each type of bike sold, we can now calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, resulting in a total of 5 * 6 = 30 bales after 6 hours. Concurrently, the truck collects 3 bales per hour, yielding a total of 3 * 6 = 18 bales after 6 hours.

The difference between the total bales produced and the total bales collected can be calculated as 30 - 18 = 12. Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class. Since he attends 5 classes per day, each lasting 40 minutes, the daily total is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Multiplying this by the number of days he attends classes (5 days a week) yields a weekly total of 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Additionally, John dedicates 1/16 of his weekly minutes to extra learning on the weekends. To find this amount, we calculate 1/16 of 1000 minutes, which equals 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

The total minutes John spends learning per week is the sum of his class time and weekend learning time: 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we must first calculate the height of the ball after the initial drop. Since the ball is dropped from a three-story balcony, with each story being 24 feet high, the initial height of the ball is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is then 2/3 of its initial height, which can be calculated as (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach a height of 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the height of the first child as x. We know that the first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 72 inches. Therefore, x = 72.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is x + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the orchard, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The total number of apples sold is 2000, and the orchard sells apples in bags of 10. 

First, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the total number of bags sold: 2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags.

Next, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings: 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we can work backwards through the sequence of events.

First, we know that a group of Allosaurus consumed 270 kilograms of the remaining meat. This implies that the velociraptors, who scavenged half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) ate, must have consumed the other half of the 270 kilograms. Therefore, the velociraptors ate 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex initially consumed half of the triceratops' meat, the T-Rex ate 135 kilograms. To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we can add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount the velociraptors ate: 135 + 135 = 270 kilograms.

However, this is the amount left after the T-Rex ate. To find the initial amount, we must double this value, as the T-Rex ate half of it. Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Final answer: 540"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total surface area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total surface area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total surface area by 20: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we must first determine the total number of shaken sodas and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

To express this probability as a percentage, we divide 1 by 10 and multiply by 100. 

1/10 = 0.1
0.1 * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 10%."
"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their distances traveled will be additive.

The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, while the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. We can calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours using the formula: distance = speed × time.

For the first train, the distance traveled is 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles.

For the second train, the distance traveled is 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we must first calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. This equates to 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we will round down to 6 days off.

As a result, Billy is available to volunteer for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Given that he can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, his daily capacity is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Multiplying the number of days he is available by his daily capacity yields 25 * 6 = 150 people.

The final answer is 150."
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we must consider the capacity of both the buses and the cars. 

First, we calculate the total number of people in the buses. With 12 buses and each carrying 35 people, the total number of people in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the total number of people in the cars. There are 20 cars, and each carries 3 people, resulting in a total of 20 * 3 = 60 people.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars: 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can utilize the given information in a step-by-step manner. 

First, we establish Martha's age by subtracting 4 years from Mike's age, as Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Given that Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age can be calculated as 24 - 4 = 20 years.

Next, we find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age, as Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can apply the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time taken is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the time taken is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides can be calculated by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

First, we calculate the total minutes spent on lunch and breaks per day. The time for lunch is 30 minutes, and the time for breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time per day is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60. This gives us 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5. Therefore, the total time spent on lunch and breaks over 5 days is 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can start by finding the distance run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
= 3.5 * 8
= 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three individuals is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after applying the respective discounts.

The item that was returned has a cost of $15.00. The frying pan, originally priced at $20.00, is discounted by 20%. The discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which equals 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the price of the frying pan after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels, initially priced at $30.00, is discounted by 10%. The discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which equals 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Consequently, the price of the towels after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be $85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00, and then $70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the total number of jellyfish as x. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This implies that the number of large jellyfish that change color, x/15, is equal to 6.

We can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to solve for x. Multiplying both sides by 15, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To determine Caroline's age, we can utilize the given information in a step-by-step manner. 

First, we are informed that Chris is 4 years old. 

Next, we are told that Ben is two times older than Chris. This implies that Ben's age can be calculated by multiplying Chris's age by 2, resulting in Ben being 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Lastly, we are informed that Caroline is three times older than Ben. Consequently, Caroline's age can be determined by multiplying Ben's age by 3, yielding Caroline's age as 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we first need to calculate her annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her income, we can calculate this as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

However, this would mean she spends 40% of her income, which is not feasible. Assuming she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed with the calculation.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = $20,000

Annual expenses = 40% of $100,000 = $40,000

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the amount she saves as a percentage of her income.

Annual savings as a percentage of income = $20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20%

Since she saves 20% of her income, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years.

Total savings needed = Annual savings * Number of years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount. However, we need to consider the interest or growth of her savings. Assuming a 0% interest rate, she would need to work for 20 years to save $400,000.

However, this is a simplified calculation and does not take into account inflation, interest, or other factors that may affect her savings. A more accurate calculation would require additional information.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into, which is 4. This yields 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into, which is 5. This results in a final cut length of 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can express this as an equation:

0.4x = 240

where x represents the total number of students. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

This calculation yields a total of 600 students in the school.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To determine the total amount spent by the individual, we must consider the initial costs of the items purchased and the discount applied at checkout.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. To find the total cost before the discount, we add these amounts together: $19 + $26 = $45.

However, the individual utilized a coupon for $7 off. To find the final amount spent, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent by the individual at the gardening shop is $38."
"To determine the average height of heels at the party, we must first calculate the total height of all the heels. 

We have three women wearing 4-inch heels, contributing a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches. Additionally, three women are wearing 2-inch heels, adding a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches. 

The combined total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches. 

Since there are six women in total, we can find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we can find the additional miles she needs to hike per day by subtracting this value from the total miles per day she needs to hike.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and sum them up.

The cost of red balls is $9 per unit, and there are 3 red balls, resulting in a total cost of 3 * $9 = $27. 

The cost of blue balls is $5 per unit, and there are 11 blue balls, resulting in a total cost of 11 * $5 = $55.

The cost of green balls is $3 per unit, and there are 25 green balls, resulting in a total cost of 25 * $3 = $75.

The total amount received by the store is the sum of the costs of all the balls: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples Jacques will have left, we first need to calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is a quarter of the total, which can be calculated as 12 kg * (1/4) = 3 kg. 

Paul's share is 1/3 of the total, which can be calculated as 12 kg * (1/3) = 4 kg.

The combined amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially was 12 kg, Jacques will have 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg left.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight, resulting in a temperature of 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. 

In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the temperature in the morning can be calculated as -6 + 3 = 5 degrees Celsius.

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius."
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Raymond had after receiving his allowance. This can be found by adding the initial amount of money he had ($21) to the amount he saved from his allowance ($11). 

$21 (initial amount) + $11 (allowance) = $32

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on a comic book ($5) from the total amount he had after receiving his allowance. 

$32 (total amount) - $5 (comic book) = $27

Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on a puzzle ($19) from the amount he had after buying the comic book. 

$27 (amount after buying comic book) - $19 (puzzle) = $8

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

$8"
"To determine the cost of each book, we can start by calculating the total amount spent on the books. Anna initially had a budget of $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. However, she also has $2 left, indicating that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since she purchased two identical books, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the concept of percentage increase. The problem states that there was a 20% increase in enrollment. This means that the number of students this year is 120% of the number of students last year.

Let's denote the number of students last year as x. Then, the number of students this year can be represented as 1.20x.

We are given that x = 50. To find the number of students this year, we can multiply x by 1.20.

Number of students this year = 1.20x
= 1.20 * 50
= 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we can first calculate the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can find the time per blink by dividing 5 minutes by 255 blinks. This yields a time of 0.0198 minutes per blink.

Next, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks (459) to find the total time. 

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9.05}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of female and male fish, we must first calculate the total number of each type of fish in Tate's garden pond after the purchase.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquired 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The updated counts are as follows:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their respective chores, we can analyze the information provided.

Let's denote the time taken by Amalia to mow the lawn as A, the time taken by Megan to walk the dog as M, and the time taken by Dior to do laundry as D. We are given the following information:

1. A = 4 hours (Amalia's time to mow the lawn)
2. M = A + 2 (Megan's time to walk the dog is 2 hours longer than Amalia's)
3. D = A + 4 + k (Dior's time to do laundry is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's, where k is a positive integer)

We can express Megan's time as M = A + 2 and Dior's time as D = A + 4 + k.

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by all three individuals:
Total time = A + M + D
= A + (A + 2) + (A + 4 + k)
= 3A + 6 + k

Substituting A = 4, we get:
Total time = 3(4) + 6 + k
= 12 + 6 + k
= 18 + k

Since Dior's time is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's, k must be greater than 0. However, we cannot determine the exact value of k without additional information.

Therefore, the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 18 + k hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18 + k}$"
"To determine the total distance driven by John in a month, we must first calculate the round-trip distance. Given that the one-way distance is 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour, we can find the total distance by multiplying the time by the speed and then doubling it for the round trip.

The one-way distance is 2 hours * 70 miles/hour = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the information provided about Sofie's walking habits. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate her total distance over the 7-day period by multiplying her daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Given that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can find Brian's daily distance by dividing Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles. 

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers. 

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys. 

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys. 

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys. 

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 220 - 200 = 20 toys. 

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can start by calculating the weight of each dog.

Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs by adding the weights of their dogs:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the initial number of stickers Seth had.

Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Luis received x/2 stickers.

It is given that Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. This implies that Kris received x/4 stickers (half of the half that Luis received).

We are also given that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received x/4 stickers, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 64.

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we first need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can find the total number of M&M's in the large bags by multiplying the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we must first calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Next, we divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to cover this distance. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the speeds of the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We are given that A = 120 mph.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A. Substituting the value of A, we get B = 5 * 120 = 600 mph.

Furthermore, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B. Substituting the value of B, we get C = 1.25 * 600 = 750 mph.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Since Liam's age is twice Vince's age two years ago, we can set up the equation:

Liam's current age = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

We know Liam is 16 years old now, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

16 = 2 * (x - 2)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

8 = x - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate x:

x = 10

Therefore, Vince's current age is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. We can use these equations to solve for the individual values of A, C, and S.

First, we can express C in terms of S using the equation C = S + 12. Substituting this into the equation C + S = 30, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can find A by substituting the value of M into the equation A + M + C + S = 56. We know that A = M, so we can rewrite this as A + A + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get 2A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we must first calculate the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons. Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is given by:

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the crayons is:

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

As each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is also 200 ounces. Converting this to pounds:

Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = Total weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine John's total earnings, we must first calculate the number of logs he can produce from the 80-foot tree. Since he can create logs from 80% of the tree, we can calculate this as follows:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

As each log is 4 feet in length, the number of logs he can produce is:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we need to determine the total number of planks he can create from these logs. Since each log is cut into 5 planks, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate John's total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the selling price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John's total earnings are $96."
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to first establish their individual salaries.

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary, we can calculate her brother's salary by multiplying Valerie's salary by 2. This yields $10,000 per month.

Next, we need to find the mother's salary, which is twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Therefore, the mother's salary is 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they all have together by summing their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by first determining the time spent on the sidewalk. We know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the rate of speed she walks on the beach. Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x'. Consequently, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, and we can express this as:

Time on the beach = Distance on the beach / Speed on the beach
40 = 2 / x

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20
x = 0.05

Now that we have the speed on the beach, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed on the sidewalk is 2x:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk
Time on the sidewalk = 1 / (2 * 0.05)
Time on the sidewalk = 1 / 0.1
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional weeks required for Jane to accumulate a total savings of $60, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount she has already saved by multiplying her weekly savings ($4) by the number of weeks (8):
$4 * 8 = $32

Next, we subtract this amount from the desired total savings ($60) to find the remaining amount she needs to accumulate:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find the number of additional weeks required:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to reach her goal of saving $60.

"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ a straightforward approach by summing the number of blue birds in each tree. 

We have three trees with 7 blue birds each, resulting in a total of 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. Additionally, there are two trees with 4 blue birds each, contributing 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. Lastly, there is one tree with 3 blue birds.

Combining these values, we obtain 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds in total.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob possesses, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial number of marbles as x. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. This can be expressed as:

x + 24 = 60

Solving for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Therefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from the initial amount:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a thermodynamic perspective. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as x degrees Celsius.

We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33°C mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, resulting in a total of 5 ounces of water. The total heat energy of the water in the two mugs must be conserved.

The heat energy of the water in the 33°C mug is given by Q1 = mcΔT, where m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the temperature difference. Since the mass of the water is the same in both mugs, we can write Q1 = c(33 - T2), where T2 is the temperature of the water in the second mug.

The heat energy of the water in the second mug is Q2 = mcΔT, which is equal to c(x - 33), since the mass of the water is the same.

Since the total heat energy is conserved, we can set up the equation:

Q1 + Q2 = Q3

where Q3 is the heat energy of the 5 ounces of water in the water bottle. Since the specific heat capacity of water is constant, we can simplify the equation to:

c(33 - T2) + c(x - 33) = c(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

33 - T2 + x - 33 = 40

Combine like terms:

x - T2 = 40

Since T2 is the temperature of the water in the second mug, we can rewrite the equation as:

x ≥ 40

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 40 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we must first calculate the daily and weekly additions of cows and chickens.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows and chickens added in a week is as follows:

Weekly additions of cows: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
Weekly additions of chickens: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week

Over three weeks, the total number of cows added is: 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows
The total number of chickens added is: 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

The initial number of cows is 50, and the initial number of chickens is 20. Therefore, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows. Similarly, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each bagel after the discount, we first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 10% of the total cost. The discount is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Subtracting the discount from the total cost yields the final amount Russell pays: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the final amount by the number of bagels in each pack, which is 9. Therefore, the cost per bagel is $36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts. First, we need to establish the relationship between the number of scoops and the number of potatoes. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding the number of potatoes required for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We can express this as an equation: 

Let x be the number of potatoes for 1 scoop. Then, 6 - 3 = x, which simplifies to x = 3. This means that 3 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop.

Next, we are told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can express this as an equation: 

Let y be the number of potatoes Gomer ate. Then, y = 23 - 5, which simplifies to y = 18. This means that Gomer ate 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate for 18 scoops. Since 3 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we can multiply 18 scoops by 3 to find the total number of potatoes Gomer ate.

y = 18
y = 18 * 3
y = 54

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down his egg consumption into two periods: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester's daily egg consumption is 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in this period is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the subsequent 30 days, his daily egg consumption increases to 5 eggs. Consequently, the total number of eggs consumed in this period is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period is the sum of these two quantities: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

To express this in dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days is 240 / 12 = 20.

"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information. We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, and the number of green jellybeans is 17. Furthermore, it is stated that the number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans can be calculated as 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the overall total. This yields:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans in the jar is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons collected over a decade, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. 

First, we establish the number of trees and the number of lemons each tree yields per year. Given that Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons annually, we can calculate the total lemons collected in a year as follows:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Since a decade consists of 10 years, we can then multiply the annual lemon production by 10 to obtain the total lemons collected over the decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we can start by determining the total number of women on the bus initially. Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can express the total number of parts in the ratio as 5 + 9 = 14.

Let's denote the total number of passengers as 84. Since the number of men is 5 parts, we can set up the equation 5x = 84, where x represents the multiplier for the ratio. Solving for x, we get x = 84 / 5 = 16.8. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16.

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 16 = 80. To find the number of women, we can set up the equation 9x = 9 * 16 = 144. However, we are given that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation: 9x + 5x = 84. Combining like terms, we get 14x = 84. Dividing both sides by 14, we find that x = 6.

With x = 6, we can determine the initial number of women as 9x = 9 * 6 = 54. If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by calculating the number of bouquets sold. Given that each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the daily earnings from bouquets ($56) by the cost of a bouquet ($8). This yields 56 ÷ 8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is 7 * 3 = 21.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold can be found by multiplying the total number of bouquets sold (21) by the number of sunflowers per bouquet (12). This results in 21 * 12 = 252 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we must first calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

The total cost of the rocks can be found by multiplying the number of rocks purchased (100) by the cost per rock ($5). This yields a total cost of $500.

Next, we calculate the total amount earned from selling 60% of the inventory. To do this, we first find 60% of the total number of rocks (100), which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks. Then, we multiply the number of rocks sold (60) by the selling price per rock ($7), resulting in a total of $420.

Finally, we calculate the loss by subtracting the total earnings from the total cost: $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

$80"
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we can calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of days required to complete the large-sized picture scenes as L, the medium-sized picture scenes as M, and the small-sized picture scenes as S. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

5L = 45
6M = 36
7S = 49

Solving for L, M, and S, we get:

L = 45 / 5 = 9
M = 36 / 6 = 6
S = 49 / 7 = 7

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we must first convert the given quantity of eggs from dozens to individual units. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs can be expressed as 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

With four children participating in the Easter activity, we can calculate the number of eggs each child receives by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of children. This can be represented as 36 ÷ 4.

The result of this division is 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the total monthly expenditure on food for Jen's fish, we must first calculate the daily cost of food for each fish and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

Given that each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and May has 31 days, the total daily cost for all three fish can be calculated as follows:

Daily cost for one fish: $1
Daily cost for three fish: $1 * 3 = $3

Total monthly cost for three fish: $3 * 31 days = $93

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The final answer is: $93"
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. We begin by subtracting the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses she possessed.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24

Number of roses left = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother
= 30 - 24
= 6

Next, we add the number of roses she acquired:
= 6 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now possesses 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine Sid's average speed, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial 110 miles and the additional 140 miles, yielding a total of 250 miles. The total time taken is the sum of the initial 2 hours and the additional 3 hours, resulting in a total of 5 hours.

The average speed can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. Therefore, the average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to consider the joint probability of independent events. Since the outcome of one ticket does not affect the other, we can multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 0.6.

The joint probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the number of seashells each person collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as x. Since Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, we can express Jim's collection as x + 5. We are given that Jim's collection is 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we find that x = 22. This implies that Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can express Carrey's collection as x/2. Since we know that x = 22, we can determine that Carrey collected 22/2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells collected by the three individuals: 22 (Carlos) + 27 (Jim) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

To divide the seashells equally among the three people, we can calculate 60 ÷ 3 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend days separately.

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, and he consumes 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on the weekend. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and he consumes 5 carrots each day, resulting in a total of 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Finally, we add the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend days to obtain the overall weekly consumption: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total duration of the cassette, we must first calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes

The length of the second song is then 5 + 3 = 8 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we must first calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices purchased on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices purchased on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is the sum of these two amounts, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, Linus earned a profit of $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We are given that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Furthermore, Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane as 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we must first calculate the total energy demand of the population.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

Total energy demand = 2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

However, this represents the total number of bottles required to meet 100% of the energy demand. Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find the difference between the total demand and the current production.

Additional bottles needed = Total energy demand - Current production
= 460 bottles - 4200 bottles
= -3740 bottles

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, the company does not need to produce any additional bottles to meet the energy demands of 2300 people.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we must first establish the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Given that Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple and 1/4 in blue, we can calculate the respective numbers as follows:

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers and all the blue wearers also wear bows, we can calculate this as:

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%."
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, which is 1907. Then, we calculate the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, which is 2136. 

The sum of these two days is 4043. To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we subtract this sum from the total number of reports received last week, which is 5168.

5168 - 4043 = 1125

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total area of land sold in the first two transactions. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The total area sold in the first two transactions is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so the total amount earned from the last sale is 20 * 3 = $60.

To find the total amount earned, we add the earnings from the first two sales: $50 + $30 = $80. Then, we add the earnings from the last sale: $80 + $60 = $140.

Therefore, Abraham will earn a total of $140 from selling his unused land.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can start by finding half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, we calculate half of her age as 26 / 2 = 13.

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age, yielding 13 - 10 = 3.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we must first establish the daily usage pattern. Given that he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate the total daily usage as follows:

Daily usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times he goes out per day
Daily usage = 2 * 3
Daily usage = 6 face masks

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total usage every 2 days = Daily usage * 2
Total usage every 2 days = 6 * 2
Total usage every 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual. 

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up the total number of eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, resulting in a combined total of 400 apartments. 

The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two, which is 400. To find the total number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. This gives us 400 + (0.6 * 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is the sum of the apartments in the first two complexes and the third complex: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

Given that he earns $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings can be calculated as 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern of the tree.

The tree's fruit production follows a specific pattern: 
- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which means it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 400 fruits.
- The ninth year is a year of dormancy, and the tree does not produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 400 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we can calculate the amount Sophia gave him as a fraction of her total wealth. Since Sophia also had $100, we can calculate 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. 

We then add this amount to Jack's initial $100, resulting in a total of $120.

The final amount of money Jack has is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this relationship as an equation: B = Y - 7.

Additionally, we know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be written as R = 4B.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can express this as the equation Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combining like terms, we have Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation yields 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that Y = 12.

Now that we have determined the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope using the equation B = Y - 7, which gives us B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope using the equation R = 4B, resulting in R = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the amount of money Rissa was initially given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, we can calculate Rissa's initial amount as 3 times Ronnie's amount, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This implies that she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

To find the amount Rissa gave to her sister, we can calculate 1/5 of $15, which is $3. 

Now, we know that Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister. Therefore, Rissa is left with $15 - $3 = $12.

Since the problem does not mention Ronnie giving any money to her sister, Ronnie still possesses the $5 she was initially given.

The final answer is $5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

However, this equation is not entirely accurate, as it implies that the amount of yellow paint is equal to the amount of each color. Instead, we should consider that the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. This means that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors, which is 4x.

We can set up the equation: 4x = 12.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 3.

Since the amount of red paint is 'x', the amount of red paint used is 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each room and then sum them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times larger than a standard bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can calculate the total area of the house by adding the areas of all the rooms together: 240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2440}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted across the week, we can utilize a simple yet effective approach. By recognizing that the number of clouds doubles each day, we can express this as a geometric sequence. The first term, a, is 3 (the number of clouds on Monday), and the common ratio, r, is 2 (since the number of clouds doubles each day).

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 5 (the number of days).

Substituting the given values, we get: S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2) = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1) = 3 * (-31) / (-1) = 3 * 31 = 93.

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted across the week is 93.

The final answer is 93."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box, we first need to calculate the cost of one pod. Given that the regular box of 100 pods costs $12, we can find the cost of one pod as follows:

Cost of one pod = Total cost of the box / Number of pods in the box
= $12 / 100
= $0.12

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the available amount by the cost of one pod:

Number of cycles = Available amount / Cost of one pod
= $1 / $0.12
= 8.33

Since we cannot run a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of cycles that can be run with the new box is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40 bills. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he is left with 20 bills. Finally, he triples his money, resulting in 60 bills. 

To convert these bills to 5-dollar bills, we divide the total number of bills by 5. Therefore, Thomas has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is 14.5."
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can approach the problem by first calculating the amount of chalk used on Monday. 

Given that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day and he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, we can calculate the total amount of chalk used on Monday as follows:

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the amount of chalk used on Monday can be expressed as 0.20L. We are also given that this amount is equal to 45% of the total chalk, so we can set up the equation:

0.20L = 0.45L

However, this equation is not correct, as it implies that the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which contradicts the given information. Instead, we can calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday as follows:

Let's denote the amount of chalk used on Monday as x. We know that x is 45% of the total chalk, so we can express this as:

x = 0.45L

We also know that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, and he used up 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. This means that the remaining chalk is 2.25 inches. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can set up the equation:

0.20(5 - x) = 2.25

Simplifying the equation:

1 - 0.20x = 2.25/5
1 - 0.20x = 0.45
-0.20x = -0.55
x = 2.75

Now that we know the amount of chalk used on Monday (2.75 inches), we can calculate the number of days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day. Let's denote the number of days as 'd'. We can set up the equation:

0.20(5 - 2.75)d = 2.75

Simplifying the equation:

d = 2.75 / (0.20 * 2.25)
d = 2.75 / 0.45
d = 6.11

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have 7 days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of the total number of girls, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of the total number of boys, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can start by calculating the number of face masks Mike purchased. We are given that Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to find thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. This can be calculated as 3 times 5, which equals 15.

Finally, we are told that Johnny bought 2 more face masks than thrice the number Mike bought. Therefore, we add 2 to 15, resulting in a total of 17 face masks purchased by Johnny.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we first need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than the number drilled, which means the dentist caps 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
= 4 + 11
= 15

Total number of teeth James has = 30

Now, we can calculate the percentage of teeth fixed by dividing the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To determine the amount of refund Mr. Marcellus received, we first need to calculate the quantity of milk that was returned. This can be found by multiplying the total gallons purchased (4000) by the fraction of the milk that was past its expiration date (2/5).

The calculation is as follows: (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund can be calculated by multiplying the quantity returned (1600 gallons) by the cost per gallon ($3.5).

Refund = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let W represent Wendy's current age and C represent Colin's current age. From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

The second statement tells us that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute W = 5C + 35 into the second equation to solve for C:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to first calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000. 

We can do this by dividing the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since Bob has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Finally, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books each school can get.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the sequence of events and use a systematic approach.

Initially, Newton picks up 2 apples. He then throws 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This results in a total of 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he puts all but 1 apple in his pocket, which means he puts 6 apples in his pocket and throws 1 apple back into the tree. As a result, 6 more apples fall out, bringing the total to 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Since Newton picks up all the remaining apples and goes home, the total number of apples he brings home is 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the number of 50 kg bags in the total order. This can be achieved by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg).

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to obtain the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of slices consumed by her six friends. Each friend consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, resulting in a total of 10 slices per friend. With six friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since each cheese pizza contains 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza contains 8 slices, we can calculate the number of pizzas required for each type as follows:

For cheese pizza: 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pizzas

As we cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Kate needs to purchase 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to ensure her friends have enough slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the miles he ran on each day. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which amounts to 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles. On Tuesday and Thursday, he ran 5 miles each day, resulting in 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles. 

Combining these values, we obtain the total miles run: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we must consider the net rate at which he builds snowballs. Jay's hourly rate is 20 snowballs, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs lost per hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

The net hourly rate is then 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour. To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net hourly rate:

60 / 12 = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine Jim's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jim's age as 'x'. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can express this relationship as an equation: 2x = 28.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = 28 / 2 = 14.

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of apple slices consumed, we can analyze the information provided. Doxa initially sliced the apple into 8 pieces. 

Given that Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, and her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, we can deduce the following:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices consumed, we add the slices eaten by each individual:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

We are given that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 63.

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 63"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we must first calculate the difference in length of her hair. The initial length of her hair was 10 inches, and it ended at 8 inches. Therefore, the reduction in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Given that the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut can be calculated as 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, we obtain the total cost of the cut and color: $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we must first calculate her total hours worked. Given that she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate, which is $1.5 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings from hourly rate are:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Additionally, since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an extra $10. Thus, her total earnings for April are:

Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To determine Jason's total earnings, we can calculate the amount earned from each activity and then sum them up.

Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher. 

In a two-week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 x $0.50 = $3.00. He did his laundry once, earning $3.00. He took the trash out twice, resulting in 2 x $0.75 = $1.50. Lastly, he cleaned his room once, earning $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we must first establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a shark has three times the blood of a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the blood volume of a shark by multiplying the whale's blood volume by 3.

Blood volume of a shark = 3 * Blood volume of a whale
Blood volume of a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood volume of a shark = 120 gallons

Now, to find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of a single shark by 10.

Total blood volume of ten sharks = Blood volume of a shark * 10
Total blood volume of ten sharks = 120 gallons * 10
Total blood volume of ten sharks = 1200 gallons

"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct periods: morning, 10:00, and evening.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. At 10:00, an additional 40 people arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 40 = 90 individuals.

Subsequently, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. This brings the total to 90 + 80 = 170 individuals.

Lastly, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 170 + 120 = 290 individuals.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we calculate the number of red pens by multiplying the number of packs by the number of pens per pack: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens, which is twice the amount of red pens: 2 * 25 pens = 50 black pens.

Finally, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we must first calculate the cost of the scotch and cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, we can calculate its cost by multiplying the scotch price by 1.5: $60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle.

John purchases twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is then 20 × $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and cognac to find the total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we must first calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then sum them.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which equates to 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Furthermore, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. Consequently, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days by adding the respective totals:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To solve the given problem, we can start by translating the statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" into a mathematical equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as x. The equation can be written as 4x + 8 = 40.

To isolate x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can find this by dividing the total number of fish by 3. 

Total number of fish = 66
Number of fish with red stripes = 66 / 3 = 22

Next, we need to find the number of remaining fish after removing those with red stripes. This is done by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Number of remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Now, we calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish to determine the number of fish with blue stripes.

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
= 20

Finally, to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we must first establish the daily water removal rates for each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting.

Given this information, we can calculate the daily water removal rates as follows:

- Low setting: 1 liter/day
- Medium setting: 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day
- High setting: 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water removed at each setting over the specified periods:

- Low setting (3 days): 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
- Medium setting (3 days): 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
- High setting (5 days): 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to establish the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x. According to the problem, the amount of the second medicine is 3 times that of the first, so it can be represented as 3x. 

We are given that the amount of the first medicine is 14 mL, so x = 14. Therefore, the amount of the second medicine is 3x = 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest on the initial loan. The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in 11 months is $25 per month. We can calculate this as:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Therefore, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the packing efficiency. This gives us 360 / 0.8 = 450 jelly beans.

Next, we need to find the number of red jelly beans. We are told that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

Therefore, Tim's estimate of the number of red jelly beans was 765 fewer than the true number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This equates to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing 60, the total becomes 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."

For the initial 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. Therefore, the total cost for this period is calculated as follows:

Total cost for the first 5 years = 5 years * $2/year = $10

In the subsequent 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This represents a 50% increase in the original cost. To calculate the new cost, we can use the following formula:

New cost = Original cost + (Original cost * Increase percentage)
New cost = $2 + ($2 * 0.5)
New cost = $2 + $1
New cost = $3

The total cost for the next 3 years is then calculated as:

Total cost for the next 3 years = 3 years * $3/year = $9

To find the overall total, we add the costs of both periods:

Total cost = Total cost for the first 5 years + Total cost for the next 3 years
Total cost = $10 + $9
Total cost = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we must first calculate the total number of groups that can be formed. With 10 students in each grade and 3 grades in total, the total number of students is 10 * 3 = 30. Since only 8 students can participate in the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. The time required for each group is 45 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is also 45 minutes. Thus, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:

135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can calculate the cost of the items separately and then sum them up.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated as 4 * $20 = $80. 

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of the costs of the tables and the roof frames, which is $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can establish the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we obtain:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece, we can calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning Aiden needs, we must first establish the relationship between the number of meatballs and the amount of meat used. Since Aiden achieves 16 meatballs per pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total pounds of meat required to produce 80 meatballs by dividing the desired number of meatballs by the yield per pound.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Given that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed by multiplying the pounds of meat by the seasoning rate.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must first calculate the total width of the windows. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window.

Let's denote the number of windows as 'n' and the width of each window as 'w'. The total width of the windows is then given by the product of 'n' and 'w'.

n = 5
w = 35 inches

Total width = n * w
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the total fabric required by multiplying the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we can break it down into two distinct intervals: the initial 16 minutes and the subsequent 20 minutes. 

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, resulting in a total cost of 16 * $0.25 = $4.00. 

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost drops to $0.20 per minute, yielding a total cost of 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we must first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday. Since it rained 2 inches on Monday, twice this amount would be 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

Next, we add 1 more inch to this amount, resulting in a total of 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of cupcakes as 'x'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes and brownies is 10. We can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 4x - 2 = 10. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation yields 4x = 12. Dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = 3.

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the original cost of the pedicure is $40. The total cost of both services without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which can be calculated as 0.20 * $75 = $15. Therefore, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she requires 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can break down the information provided. 

First, we have three magazines that send 12 issues each, resulting in a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year. 

Next, we have one magazine that sends 6 issues per year. 

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we add the issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's total can be expressed as x + 8.

Samantha, on the other hand, has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so her total can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, which allows us to set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides yields:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the final price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December. The toy was initially priced at $40, and it increased by 80%. This can be represented as $40 + 0.8 * $40. 

$40 + 0.8 * $40 = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. The price in December was $72, and it decreased by 50%. This can be represented as $72 - 0.5 * $72.

$72 - 0.5 * $72 = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To determine Charlie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from both the standard lessons and the lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 one-hour lessons, so the total amount he earns from the standard lessons is:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25%, which is equivalent to a 0.25 discount. To find the reduced rate, we can calculate 25% of the standard rate and subtract it from the standard rate:

$80 - (0.25 * $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, we can calculate the total amount Charlie earns from the lessons with veterans:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we can find the total amount Charlie will make for the day by adding the earnings from the standard lessons and the lessons with veterans:

$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we must first sum up all the individual scores. 

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

We can calculate the sum of these scores as follows:

50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

Since there are 9 scores, we can find the mean by dividing the total score by 9:

Mean = Total score ÷ Number of scores
Mean = 630 ÷ 9
Mean = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 20 - 5
x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we first need to calculate the number of apples he had after eating 2/5 of them.

Let's start by finding 2/5 of 60, which is equivalent to (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples. This means Walter ate 24 apples, leaving him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining 36 apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples. After giving his sister 9 apples, Walter is left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Since Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. If 9 novels represent three-quarters of the total novels written this year, we can express this relationship as:

9 = (3/4) * x

where x is the total number of novels written this year. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we must first calculate the total distance traveled. Given that he maintains an average speed of 50 km/hr for 72 hours, we can calculate the total distance covered as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total distance covered by dividing the distance covered by the total distance and multiplying by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can start by calculating the total number of grapes used by the family. Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, who consumed 6 grapes. Therefore, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we add the total grapes used by the family to the grapes used by the mother: 84 (total used) + 48 (used by the mother) = 132 grapes.

Therefore, there were 132 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day, we can utilize the principle of addition. 

We are given that 13 teachers were absent due to illness, and 9 substitute teachers were present to aid in the school's operations. To find the total number of teachers, we simply add the number of absent teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = Number of absent teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers = 22

Therefore, there were 22 teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on making macaroni and cheese, we must first calculate the weekly cost. The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and the total cost of cheese is $3.00 for cheddar and $6.00 for gruyere, as the latter is twice the cost of the former. Therefore, the total weekly cost is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud prepares macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost can be calculated by multiplying the weekly cost by 52 weeks. Thus, the total annual expenditure is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the task. With 80 classrooms and 15 minutes per classroom, the total time spent cleaning can be found by multiplying the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Converting the total time to hours, we divide by 60:

1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:

(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. Given that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, we can denote the capacity of the bottom shelf as 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf, holding 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, can be represented as 20 - 5 = 15 books.

The total capacity of the shelves can be calculated by summing the capacities of each shelf: 10 + 10 + 15 = 35 books.

However, this calculation only accounts for the middle and top shelves. Since the problem specifies that there are two middle shelves, we must also consider the capacity of the bottom shelf. The total capacity of the bookcases is therefore 35 + 20 = 55 books.

To find the number of bookcases needed, we divide the total number of books (110) by the total capacity of the shelves (55). This yields 110 / 55 = 2.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bookcase, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we must first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of dozens of eggs purchased (5) by the cost per dozen ($2.40). This yields a total cost of 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Next, we must calculate the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, we can calculate the total selling price by multiplying the number of eggs (60) by the selling price per egg ($1). This results in a total selling price of 60 * $1 = $60.

Finally, we can determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price: $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total, or 1/2 * 100 = 50 hats.

Next, we subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Then, we find the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we must first calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Next, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag, which is 30. This yields a cost per stick of $15.00 / 30 = $0.50.

To express this cost in cents, we multiply by 100, resulting in 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we must first calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she must answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as follows:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Now, we can find 70% of the total questions:
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct

Since Audrey has already answered 60% of the first test correctly, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test as follows:
Questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions already answered correctly on the first test
= 77 - 60
= 17 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 17 questions correctly on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we can establish a relationship between the number of strawberry cubes and the total number of ice cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. The number of blueberry cubes is then 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as 5x - 4.

Given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we have determined the number of strawberry cubes, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we can apply the multiplication of three consecutive numbers: the number of games played per year (40), the number of years (4), and the points scored per game (21).

The total points scored can be determined by multiplying these values together: 40 * 4 * 21.

First, we multiply 40 by 4, yielding 160. Then, we multiply 160 by 21, resulting in 3360.

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can analyze the sequence of events. Initially, he had 10 marbles. Upon tripping and dropping half of them, he lost 5 marbles. This left him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Subsequently, he found 3 more marbles, increasing his total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, upon inspecting the marbles further, he discovered that one of them was not a marble but a bead. Therefore, he discarded it, resulting in no change to the number of marbles he had.

The final number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 8."
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into manageable components.

First, we establish the conversion rates between the different stages of the sales process. Specifically, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason generates one potential customer. This implies a conversion rate of 1/25 or 0.04 (4%) for the initial stage.

Next, we consider the conversion rate from potential customers to actual customers. Given that for every two potential customers, one customer ultimately purchases a car, the conversion rate is 1/2 or 0.5 (50%) for the second stage.

To calculate the total number of potential customers required to achieve the desired sales outcome, we multiply the conversion rates: 0.04 * 0.5 = 0.02, or 2%. This means that Jason needs to generate 1/0.02 = 50 potential customers to ultimately sell 15 cars.

Finally, we can determine the number of telephone calls needed to generate 50 potential customers by multiplying the desired number of potential customers by the conversion rate for the initial stage: 50 * 25 = 1250.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 1250 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1250}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we must first calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 4 people in the household, and each person has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 x 2 = 8.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. The house has 8 rooms, with half having 4 small candles and the other half having 5 medium candles. Since half of 8 is 4, there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16.
The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding these values together: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips available. Since Mitchell purchases two bags, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find the number of chips each person receives. This can be calculated as 110 ÷ 5 = 22.

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and calculate the time for each segment.

The first side of the cube takes 5 minutes to complete. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, resulting in 10 minutes for each. The last two sides, the fourth and fifth sides, take half as long as the first side, which is 2.5 minutes each.

To find the total time, we sum the time for each segment: 5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second side) + 10 minutes (third side) + 2.5 minutes (fourth side) + 2.5 minutes (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room, we can utilize a systematic approach to solve the problem.

Given that the number of helmets is 20, and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can establish a relationship between the number of helmets and footballs. This relationship can be expressed as:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2

Substituting the given value for the number of helmets, we can solve for the number of footballs:

20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Furthermore, it is stated that there are half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of calls he handles in an hour. Given that it takes him 15 minutes to address a call, we can calculate this by dividing the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time required to handle a single call (15 minutes).

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Next, we multiply the number of calls he handles per hour by the number of hours he works in a day (6 hours) to find the daily call volume.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Finally, we multiply the daily call volume by the number of days he works in a week (5 days) to obtain the total weekly call volume.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the additional time required for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we can calculate the difference in drying times for a single painting and then multiply it by the number of paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes. The difference in drying time for a single painting is 12 - 7 = 5 minutes.

To find the additional time required for 6 paintings, we multiply the difference by the number of paintings: 5 minutes * 6 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups based on the amount of water each group requires.

First, we calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be found by multiplying the number of plants by the amount of water each requires: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water. This is found by multiplying the number of plants by the amount of water each requires: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Lastly, we determine the amount of water needed for the remaining 8 plants, which require a quarter of a cup of water. This is calculated by multiplying the number of plants by the amount of water each requires: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water needed, we add the amounts calculated for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the time spent hopping on land and the time spent swimming through the water. Given that half of the distance is traversed on land and the other half in water, we can calculate the time for each segment separately.

The total distance is 200 yards, with 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. 

The time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards divided by the land speed of 20 yards per minute, resulting in 5 minutes. 

The time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards divided by the water speed of 10 yards per minute, yielding 10 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of these two segments, which is 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

First, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8) to determine the number of boxes needed. This calculation yields:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can then multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to obtain the total cost:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can break down the costs into two components: the main phone and the additional phones. 

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as M and the cost of each additional phone as A. We are given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so we can express this relationship as M = 2A.

We are also given that the main phone costs $20, so M = $20. Using this information, we can solve for A: $20 = 2A, which implies A = $10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can calculate the total cost of the four additional phones: 4A = 4($10) = $40.

Finally, we can find the total cost of the whole phone plan by adding the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones: M + 4A = $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60."
"To determine Derrick's total earnings in June, we must first calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in the month. Since he produces 10 dozen doughnuts daily, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, Derrick's daily production is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.

With 30 days in June, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick's total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut: 3600 * 2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are $7200."
"To determine the number of days required to upload all the photos, we can employ a simple division operation. 

The total number of photos, 210, is to be divided by the number of photos uploaded per day, 7. This can be calculated as follows:

Therefore, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To determine the total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning services, we can calculate the cost of each item individually and then sum them up.

The cost of blouses is 5 items multiplied by the cost per item, which is $5.00. This gives us 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of pants, which is 2 pairs multiplied by the cost per pair, $8.00. This results in 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the skirt, which is 1 item multiplied by the cost per item, $6.00. This gives us $6.00.

Now, we add the costs of the blouses, pants, and skirt together to find the total cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning services in 5 weeks.

The final answer is: $47.00"
"To determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we must first calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute. 

Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, we can calculate his new speed as 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Since each page contains 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

On the first day, Conor observed 50 people at the beach. The next day, the number of people increased by 20, resulting in 70 individuals. On the third day, the total number of people doubled from the second day, yielding 140 people.

For the remaining four days of the week, Conor observed an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for these days, we can multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week by summing the individuals from each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into distinct intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped in each interval.

Initially, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds. Then, in the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases three times, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, leading to 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, yielding 40 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels popped, we sum the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

Additionally, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds continue to pop from residual heat. This equates to 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first establish the lemon-to-juice ratio. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 cup as follows:

6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Next, we calculate the total number of cups required for 5 gallons of lemonade, as 1 gallon is equivalent to 4 cups. Therefore, 5 gallons would require:

5 gallons * 4 cups/gallon = 20 cups

Since Tim also wants to make an additional gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of cups required for this extra gallon. As it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice:

1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:

6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:

20 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 120 lemons for the 5 gallons
120 lemons + 12 lemons = 132 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption of both breeds. 

The daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of these two values: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will require 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we must first calculate the total number of legs of all the animals. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of 2-legged animals by 2 and the number of 4-legged animals by 4, then summing the results.

Let's denote the number of 2-legged animals as 'a' and the number of 4-legged animals as 'b'. We are given that a = 10 and b = 15. 

The total number of legs can be represented as 2a + 4b. Substituting the given values, we get:

Total legs = 2(10) + 4(15)
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

Since each pair consists of two legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to obtain the total number of pairs:

Total pairs = Total legs / 2
Total pairs = 80 / 2
Total pairs = 40

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize the information provided about the number of blue and yellow blocks. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

Given that there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, we can express the number of yellow blocks as 2 * 4 = 8. Therefore, the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of blocks in the tower: 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32.

Solving for 'r', we get:

4 + 8 + r = 32
12 + r = 32
r = 32 - 12
r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20."
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Initially, Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. The distance covered during this period can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 5 hours
= 90 miles

Next, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance covered during this period is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 8 hours
= 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can find the net distance from his house by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation. The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which means its value decreases by 30% of $9000. This can be calculated as 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. Therefore, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Hence, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we must first establish the quantities of the other colors. We are given that the bag contains 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

The number of orange candies can be calculated as 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies by adding these values together: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43.

The final answer is 43."
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we must first calculate the cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.

The cost of one bus trip can be calculated as 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two costs: $80 + $56 = $136.

"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as 'x'. Since Mazie initially had 52 marbles and gave them to the twins, we can express the total number of marbles given as the sum of the marbles given to Dallas and Darla: x + 25 = 52.

We know that Dallas initially had 25 marbles, which is obtained by subtracting the 4 marbles dropped from the total he received. 

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 25 from both sides of the equation: x = 52 - 25.

x = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the total cost of the outing, we must consider the expenses incurred by the family. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, while a child's ticket costs $8. The family consists of 3 individuals, so the total cost of the tickets is calculated as follows:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

In addition to the tickets, the family purchases 2 popcorns at $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

The total cost of the outing is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38."
"To determine the force required to move the car, we must first calculate the total weight of the vehicle and its contents. This involves adding the weight of the car, the weight of the luggage, and the combined weight of the two children.

The weight of the car is given as 1200 pounds, the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds, and the combined weight of the two children is 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James will need 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. Given that Mia is 16 years younger than Emma and Mia is 40 years old, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can calculate the average by taking the sum of their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the sum of the seashells found by each individual. This can be achieved by adding the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.

The sum of seashells found = 214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from this total to obtain the number of good seashells.

Number of good seashells = Total seashells found - Number of cracked seashells
= 732 - 67
= 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells found is 665."

"To determine the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle, we first need to calculate half of Steve's time, which is 10 hours. 

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we can calculate her time by adding 2 hours to the half of Steve's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption of Dexter's pigs. Since each pig consumes 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total daily consumption can be calculated as follows:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

As there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly feed consumption is:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, we can calculate the amount of feed left by subtracting the total weekly consumption from the total amount ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we must first calculate the daily and weekly time spent on each activity.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, resulting in a total of 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 minutes * 7 = 210 minutes. 

Converting this to hours, we get 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours per week.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, resulting in a total of 5 hours per week.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
3.5 hours (meditation) + 5 hours (yoga) = 8.5 hours per week.

Since the question asks for the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we must first calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then account for the 50% increase in the number of seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower contains 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

The large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, resulting in 18. Adding this to the number of seeds in the small sunflower yields 36 + 18 = 54 seeds for the large sunflower.

Finally, we sum the seeds from both sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express this relationship as a ratio: Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens.

Given that George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens by multiplying 18 by 3.

Timothy's pens = 18 * 3 = 54

Next, we can determine the number of pens Sarah has by dividing Timothy's pens by 2, as she has half as many pens as Timothy.

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. Therefore, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine Ryan's current financial situation, we must first calculate his total earnings from completing his chores. Since he earns $6 per week and has done his chores for 3 weeks, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $6 * 3
Total earnings = $18

Next, we need to account for the cost of the ice cream cones he purchased for himself and his friends. The total cost of the ice cream cones can be found by multiplying the cost per cone by the number of cones purchased:

Total cost of ice cream cones = Cost per cone * Number of cones
Total cost of ice cream cones = $1.25 * 4
Total cost of ice cream cones = $5

Now, we can find Ryan's remaining funds by subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:

Remaining funds = Total earnings - Total cost of ice cream cones
Remaining funds = $18 - $5
Remaining funds = $13

Finally, we can determine how many movie tickets Ryan can purchase with his remaining funds. Since each ticket costs $6.50, we can divide his remaining funds by the cost per ticket to find the number of tickets he can buy:

Number of tickets = Remaining funds / Cost per ticket
Number of tickets = $13 / $6.50
Number of tickets = 2

"To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and her sister, Lani, we need to calculate the sum of their individual expenditures.

Ellen's purchases consist of a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Therefore, her total expenditure is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani's purchases include a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total cost of the bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, her total expenditure is $30 + $200 = $230.

The combined total expenditure for both Ellen and Lani is $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To determine the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing one jar of the mixture. This involves summing the costs of the individual ingredients: passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of 2 pounds of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.
Therefore, the total cost of one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Given that Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we can calculate the value of each type of coin and sum them together. 

First, we'll calculate the value of the quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8. 

Next, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50. 

Then, we'll calculate the value of the nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6. 

Lastly, we'll calculate the value of the pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50. 

Now, we'll add the values together: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To determine Janet's remaining balance, we must first calculate the total amount she expended. This can be achieved by summing the individual expenditures: $3.50 (ice cream) + $7.50 (movie tickets for herself) + $7.50 (movie tickets for her sister) + $8.50 (bracelet).

Total expenditure = $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $28

Janet's parents provided her with $40. To find her remaining balance, we subtract the total expenditure from the amount given by her parents.

Remaining balance = $40 - $28 = $12

Therefore, Janet has $12 left."
"To determine Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period, we must first calculate the number of days he is open. Since Josh operates his car shop 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and is closed on Wednesday and Sunday, he is open 6 days a week. Over a 2-week period, this equates to 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Given that Josh services 3 cars per day, the total number of cars serviced in 12 days is 3 * 12 = 36.

As Josh receives $4 for each car serviced, his total earnings over the 2-week period can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars serviced by the payment per car: 36 * 4 = $144.

Therefore, Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period are $144."
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He then consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This results in a reduction of 3 cookies in total, leading to:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Following this, he consumes 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, which results in:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

Subsequently, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leading to:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Lastly, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, which adds 8 new cookies to his collection:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Therefore, Randy now has a total of 6 + 7 + 6 = 19 cookies.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we can calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves. Each half consists of 6 toy soldiers. 

For the first half, Matthew would sell each toy for $5. Therefore, the total earnings from this half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would sell each toy for $7. Thus, the total earnings from this half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so the total number of holes dug is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Next, we need to consider the net change in the number of holes per day. Nate fills in 9 holes per day, while the dog digs 6 holes per day. Therefore, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day.

Now, we can calculate the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes by dividing the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Finally, we convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

The difference in average enrollment between the two schools can be found by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies. 

Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

The sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies is 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, we can find the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as t, b, and p, respectively.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so t = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so p = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so we can set up the equation: t + b + p = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 8 + b + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: b = 5.

However, we are asked to find the number of beakers Igor lost. Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - b = 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg requires 2 screws, the total number of screws needed for 4 tables can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables * Number of legs per table * Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2
Total screws needed = 32

Given that James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply add the number of eggs in each basket. 

The first basket contains 10 eggs, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs, which is 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of money raised, we can start by calculating the individual contributions of each person. 

Let's denote Alexandra's contribution as A, Kim's contribution as K, Maryam's contribution as M, and Sarah's contribution as S. We are given the following information:

1. K = A + $320
2. M = S + $400
3. S = $300

We can use substitution to express K and M in terms of S:

1. K = A + $320 = (S + $400) + $320 = S + $720
2. M = S + $400

Now, we can express A in terms of S:

1. A = K - $320 = (S + $720) - $320 = S + $400

Now, we can express all contributions in terms of S:

1. A = S + $400
2. K = S + $720
3. M = S + $400
4. S = $300

To find the total amount of money raised, we can add the contributions together:

Total = A + K + M + S
= (S + $400) + (S + $720) + (S + $400) + $300
= 3S + $1520
= $300 + $1520
= $1820

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $1820."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'a' miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as 'v' miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as:

a = 2v

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice the distance Aaron ran. If we let 'd' represent the distance Aaron ran, we can express this as:

d = 4 / 2
d = 2

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it took Aaron to complete his part of the race. We are given that Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

16 = d / a
16 = 2 / a
a = 2 / 16
a = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find his time by multiplying the distance he ran by his speed:

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 2 * (1/8)
Time = 1/4 minutes

Since Vanessa's speed is twice that of Aaron's, we can express this as:

v = 2 * (1/8)
v = 1/4 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race by multiplying the distance she ran by her speed:

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * (1/4)
Time = 1 minute

The final answer is 1."
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required can be calculated as 3 times the length of the dock, which equals 3 * 200 = 600 feet.

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to purchase, we must subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required. This yields 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we must first calculate the daily revenue. Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, with each reservation consisting of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation) * $5 per meal + $5 per bottle of wine
= 12 meals * $5 per meal + $5 per bottle
= $60 + $5
= $65 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue can be calculated by multiplying the daily revenue by 2:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $65 per day * 2
= $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can employ the concept of percentage increase. The vendor initially purchased 50 watermelons for $80 and then sold them at a 25% profit.

First, we calculate the total cost of the watermelons, which is given as $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60.

Next, we calculate the profit made on the sale of the watermelons. The profit percentage is 25%, which can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100: 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25. We then multiply this decimal by the cost per watermelon to find the profit: 0.25 × $1.60 = $0.40.

Finally, we add the profit to the cost per watermelon to determine the selling price: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a different angle. Let's consider the time it takes for Ana and Jane to peel the same number of oranges. Since Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange and Jane takes 4 minutes, the ratio of their peeling rates is 1:4/3 or 3:4.

Let's assume they peel x oranges in the first minute. In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges. In the third minute, Ana will peel x - 2 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges, and so on.

We can represent the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in each minute as an arithmetic sequence. The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each minute.

Let's denote the number of minutes it takes for Ana to peel the same number of oranges as Jane as 't'. In 't' minutes, Ana will peel t oranges, and Jane will peel 4t/3 oranges.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, we can set up the equation:

t = x

Now, we can set up an equation for the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after 't' minutes:

Difference = t - (4t/3)
= (3t/3) - (4t/3)
= -t/3

Since 't' is the time it takes for Ana to peel the same number of oranges as Jane, 't' must be a multiple of 3. However, the difference -t/3 is negative, which means Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: $0$"
"To calculate the total cost Mark incurred, we need to consider the discounted price of the radiator and the labor costs.

The original price of the radiator is $400. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the labor cost, which is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we have the equation:

x + y = 20

We are also given that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:

y = 20 - x

Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

Now that we have found x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations:

y = 20 - x
y = 20 - 5
y = 15

Therefore, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we must first calculate the total number of slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

With 4 individuals sharing the pizzas equally, we can find the number of slices per person by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is 14."
