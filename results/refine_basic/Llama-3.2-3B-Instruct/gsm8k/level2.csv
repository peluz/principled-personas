"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.

She then bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her remaining eggs to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market are $18."
"To determine the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs per week, we can multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

The calculation is as follows:

3 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/week

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed required for her flock. Since each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

However, Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed to her chickens. To find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily feed:

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already given
= 60 cups - 40 cups
= 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal."
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the price of the first glass, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the cost of the remaining 15 glasses as follows:
15 glasses * $3 = $45

Now, we add the cost of the first glass to the cost of the remaining glasses:
$5 + $45 = $50

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can use the given information. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the two distinct phases of the download process.

First, Carla downloads 80% of the 200 GB file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. Since her normal download rate is 2 GB/minute, the time taken for this phase is 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Next, the download is interrupted and restarted. The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, this phase takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes (first phase) + 20 minutes (restart) + 40 minutes (second phase) = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

Let's denote the distance from home as 'd'. 

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance covered in this segment is 60 * 3 = 180 miles. 

He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move, and the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering an additional 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. 

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph, covering an additional 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance covered is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, the distance from home is 355 - 180 = 175 miles.

The final answer is 175."
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into two components: regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the regular hours worked, which is 40 hours at $10 per hour:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 45 hours in total, the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down as follows:

The number of downloads in the first month is 60. The number of downloads in the second month is three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180. 

However, the downloads in the third month reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month, which is 180 - 54 = 126.

To find the total downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen and then add the results together.

Donuts: 3 * $68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 * $80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 * $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point, we can set up an equation where the total cost equals the total revenue. Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the annual net profit is $7.50. We can set up the equation:

90 = 7.50y

To solve for 'y', we can divide both sides by 7.50:

y = 90 / 7.50
y = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

The remaining vacuum cleaners are then sold at the orange house, and we know that she sold half of what was left. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house as y/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - y/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:

x - (2x/3 - 6/3) - y/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + 6/3 - y/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 4x + 12 - 3y = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 - 3y = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x - 3y = 18

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, we can set up another equation:

x/3 = y/2

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

2x = 3y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x in terms of y:

2x = 3y
x = 3y/2

Substitute this expression for x into the first equation:

2(3y/2) - 3y = 18

Simplify the equation:

3y - 3y = 18

This equation is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house is incorrect. However, if we assume that she sold a quarter of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, we can set up a new equation:

x/4 = y/2

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions:

x = 2y

Substitute this expression for x into the first equation:

2(2y) - 3y = 18

Simplify the equation:

4y - 3y = 18

y = 18

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:

x = 2y
x = 2(18)
x = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can start by determining the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. 

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

Next, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students, or 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

The initial cost of the jewelry is $5,000, and it is expected to increase by 2.5% in the market. The potential value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:

Potential value = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
= $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
= $5,000 * 1.025
= $5,250

On the other hand, the initial cost of the electronic gadgets is $8,000, and it is expected to increase by 1.2% in the market. The potential value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:

Potential value = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
= $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
= $8,000 * 1.012
= $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"When two trains depart from San Rafael and travel westward for 80 miles each, they are essentially covering the same distance. This means that their westward distances are equal, and we can represent this as 80 miles for each train.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering a combined distance of 150 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the northward distances to find the total distance covered by each train.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. In this case, the westward distance (80 miles) and the northward distance (150 miles) form the two sides of a right-angled triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the total distance covered by each train as follows:

√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √26900 ≈ 164.58 miles

However, since the question doesn't provide a multiple-choice option for this exact value, we can round it to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 165"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. She works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour. 

Weekly earnings from teaching: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
Annual earnings from teaching: $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour.

Weekly earnings from coaching: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
Annual earnings from coaching: $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, we can find her total annual salary by adding her earnings from teaching and coaching.

Total annual salary: $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that period. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week. 

To find the total number of eggs in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 84 ÷ 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the concept of average speed. Let's denote the speed required as 'x'. We know that the total distance is 12 miles, and the total time is the sum of the time spent on the first 4 miles, the next 2 miles, and the time required to cover the remaining distance.

Let's denote the time spent on the first 4 miles as 't1' and the time spent on the next 2 miles as 't2'. We are given that t1 = 1 hour and t2 = 1 hour. The time spent on the remaining distance can be represented as t3.

The total time is the sum of t1, t2, and t3, which should be equal to the total distance divided by the desired average speed. We can set up the equation:

t1 + t2 + t3 = Total distance / Desired average speed
1 + 1 + t3 = 12 / 4
2 + t3 = 3
t3 = 1

Now, we know that the time spent on the remaining distance is 1 hour. We can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
x = 6 / 1
x = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 15 * 2/3 = 10 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 10 = 19 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age and the age at which he had his son.

First, we find Raymond's current age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age, as Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Samantha is currently 31 years old, so Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25.

Next, we subtract the age at which Raymond had his son (23) from his current age (25) to find the number of years that have passed since his son's birth.

25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold, we can break down the sales into distinct groups and calculate the total for each group.

First, we consider the initial 3 customers who purchased one DVD each. This results in a total of 3 DVDs sold.

Next, we examine the subsequent 2 customers who bought 2 DVDs each. Multiplying 2 by 2 yields 4 DVDs sold.

Lastly, we assess the final 3 customers, who did not make any purchases. This equates to 0 DVDs sold.

Now, we add the total number of DVDs sold in each group: 3 (from the first 3 customers) + 4 (from the next 2 customers) + 0 (from the last 3 customers) = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To determine the total length of the candle that melts, we need to calculate the difference in hours between the start and end times. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price, we can use the formula: Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage in decimal form).

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. First, we convert the discount percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25.

Now, we plug in the values into the formula: Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of pizza boxes as x.

The total cost of the items, excluding pizza, is $12 (chicken meal) + $15 (5 packs of milk) + $6 (4 apples) = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

We know that each pizza box costs $8.50. To find the number of pizza boxes, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing, we can calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 times $16.50, which equals $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 times $22.50, which equals $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 times $42, which equals $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream, we must first calculate the number of cartons Cynthia will purchase. Since she consumes one serving per night and there are 60 days, the total number of servings required is 60. 

Dividing the total servings by the servings per carton (15) yields:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton ($4.00):

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by adding the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Therefore, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 40 + 15 = 55 miles.

The final answer is 55."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as 'b' and the cost of the first pair of heels as 'h1' and the second pair as 'h2'. We are given that h1 = $33 and h2 = 2 * h1 = 2 * 33 = $66.

We also know that the total cost of the boots and the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

b + h1 + h2 = b - 5

Substituting the values of h1 and h2, we get:

b + 33 + 66 = b - 5

Combine like terms:

99 = b - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = b

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To determine the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar. 

Let's denote the number of jelly beans as x. The first person guesses x = 80.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one, which is (x/2) + 20. We can simplify this to (x + 40)/2.

The third person says 25% more than the first one, which is 1.25x.

Now, we have the following guesses: x, (x + 40)/2, and 1.25x.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

(x + (x + 40)/2 + 1.25x) / 3

Combine like terms: (2.25x + x + 40) / 3

Combine like terms again: (3.25x + 40) / 3

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation using the fact that the average is equal to the sum of the guesses divided by 3. Since we don't have a specific value for the average, we can use the fact that the average is equal to the sum of the guesses divided by 3.

Let's assume the average is A. Then, we can set up the equation:

A = (3.25x + 40) / 3

Since we don't have a specific value for A, we can't solve for x directly. However, we can express x in terms of A:

3A = 3.25x + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3A - 40 = 3.25x

Divide both sides by 3.25:

x = (3A - 40) / 3.25

Now, we can plug in a value for A to find x. However, since we are looking for the average guess, we can use the fact that the average is equal to the sum of the guesses divided by 3.

Let's use the average of the three guesses: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80.

Now we can plug in A = 80 into the equation:

3(80) = 3.25x + 40

240 = 3.25x + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides:

200 = 3.25x

Divide both sides by 3.25:

x = 61.54

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the average guess:

A = (3.25x + 40) / 3
= (3.25(61.54) + 40) / 3
= (200 + 40) / 3
= 240 / 3
= 80

The average guess is 80.

The final answer is 80."
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Next, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week:

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we have found the value of 'x', we can determine the number of gold coins by substituting 'x' into the expression 'x + 30':

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of jewels each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R/2 + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

We can substitute the value of R into the equation for A:

A = 40/2 + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the value of S:

S = A - 2
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = points in the first 20 minutes + points in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, we multiply 2 yogurts by 30 days to get 60 yogurts.

Next, we find the cost of one yogurt by dividing the sale price of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 4. This gives us a cost of $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts (60) by the cost of one yogurt ($1.25) to get the total cost over 30 days. This calculation yields $75.

Therefore, the total cost of yogurts over 30 days is $75.

Final answer: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to analyze the situation. John initially had an unknown number of Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. He then used the money to buy 8 video games for $20 each and had $5 left.

Let's denote the initial number of Lego sets as x. The total amount John got from selling the Lego sets is 15x. He spent $20 on 8 video games, which amounts to 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. This means the amount he got from selling the Lego sets minus the cost of the video games equals $5.

We can set up the equation: 15x - 160 = 5

To solve for x, we add 160 to both sides of the equation: 15x = 5 + 160
15x = 165

Next, we divide both sides by 15: x = 165 / 15
x = 11

This means John initially had 11 Lego sets. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine John's speed, we must first calculate the total time he spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total time spent running is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. The total distance is 60 miles, and the total time is 6 hours. 

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Let's denote Dana's walking speed as x miles per hour. Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 4x miles per hour.

We are given that Dana's skipping speed is half of her running speed, which is 3 miles per hour. So, we can set up the equation:

4x = 2 * 3
4x = 6
x = 6 / 4
x = 1.5

Now that we know Dana's walking speed, we can calculate her running speed:
Running speed = 4x = 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles per hour

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in 6 hours. We can calculate the time she spends running and walking as follows:

Time running = (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours
Time walking = (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as D.

We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S = 2 * 1 = 2.

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B = 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone. 

We know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. This means she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

Since the dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet, we need to subtract this from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. We are also given that the number of pieces remaining is 14. 

Using the equation T - P = 14, we can substitute the value of T and solve for P:

40 - P = 14

To isolate P, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

-P = 14 - 40
-P = -26

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for P:

P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the amount of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and have already consumed 1800 calories.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have with 200 calories left by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100g, we can find the total grams by multiplying the number of servings by the weight per serving.

0.8 servings * 100g/serving = 80g

Therefore, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost of the wicks is already included in the initial cost of the pound of wax. Therefore, the total cost is simply the cost of the pound of wax.

Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes Candice initially had as x. We know that she used 220 notes at work and had 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes she used and the notes she had remaining.

x = 220 + 23
x = 243

However, we are also given that Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse. So, the total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes she had in her purse and the notes she purchased.

Let's denote the number of notes in the package she purchased as y. We can set up the equation:

x = 80 + y

We know that x = 243. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

243 = 80 + y

To solve for y, we can subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

y = 243 - 80
y = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the number of blue ties is B and the cost of a blue tie is C. We know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is 2B. We also know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of a red tie is 1.5C.

We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can set up the equation:
B x C = 200

We are also given that the cost of a blue tie is $40, so C = 40. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
B x 40 = 200
B = 5

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties:
2B = 2 x 5 = 10

The cost of a red tie is 1.5C, and since C = 40, the cost of a red tie is 1.5 x 40 = 60.

The total amount spent on blue ties is 5 x 40 = 200.
The total amount spent on red ties is 10 x 60 = 600.

The total amount spent on ties is 200 + 600 = 800.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

Now, divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):
48 ÷ 6 = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine the weekly earnings of Lloyd's egg farm, we must first calculate the total number of eggs sold in a week. 

We know that the chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs sold in a week, we multiply this daily production by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from his egg farm."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to get back, we must first calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the comic books and toys that Uriah needs to remove from his book bag.

Let's start by calculating the weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can find Patchy's total by multiplying 12 by 3. This gives us 36 kittens.

Next, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we must first calculate the remaining lollipops after Jean eats 2. This can be achieved by subtracting 2 from the initial number of lollipops, which is 30.

30 - 2 = 28

Next, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled. This can be calculated as follows:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to consider the total cost of the ticket and popcorn, which is $14. 

We can find the number of times he can go to the movies by dividing the total amount of money he has ($42) by the cost of the ticket and popcorn ($14).

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to determine the remaining weight available for the boxes after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. To find the remaining weight available for the boxes, we subtract the combined weight from the bridge's weight limit:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:

1245 ÷ 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to determine the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries, we must consider the clusters and the individual raspberries separately. 

First, we calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, each containing 20 raspberries. Therefore, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries scattered across the bush, which is 67. 

The total number of raspberries is the sum of the raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187.

The final answer is: $\boxed{187}$"
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to consider the costs of the material, construction, and insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be found by multiplying $1300 by 0.1, which equals $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The total amount Janet paid is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider two periods: the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial charge for the first half of the year and the reduced charge for the second half of the year.

The initial charge for the first half of the year is $140 per month, and there are 6 months in a half year. So, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less money. To find 10% of the initial charge, we multiply $140 by 0.1:
140 * 0.1 = $14

Now, we subtract the 10% from the initial charge to get the reduced amount:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = $756

To find the total amount paid for the year, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon for Sophia's car, we can use the following calculation:

Total capacity of the tank = 12 gallons
Amount of gas used to fill the tank = 4 gallons
Remaining capacity = 12 - 4 = 8 gallons

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon:

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 8 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
100 * 8 = 4x
800 = 4x
x = 800 / 4
x = 200

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: 200"
"To determine the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we must first calculate the daily hours spent on these activities. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he repeats this pattern 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we must consider the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has two teams, with five players on each team. This results in a total of 10 players per school. With four schools participating, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

In addition to the players, each school also sent a coach. Since there are four schools, the total number of coaches is 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We are given that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we can express this as R = D - 35.

We are also given that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we can express this as E = 2R.

Substituting the expression for R into the equation for E, we get E = 2(D - 35).

Now, we know that the total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: D + R + E.

Substituting the expressions for R and E, we get D + (D - 35) + 2(D - 35).

Combining like terms, we get D + D - 35 + 2D - 70.

Simplifying further, we get 4D - 105.

We are given that the number of diamonds is 175, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 4(175) - 105.

Evaluating this expression, we get 700 - 105 = 595.

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we can start by finding the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Now, we know that there are 5 students per teacher. To find the number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. Since she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount of her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we must first determine the total number of classes she teaches in a week. 

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 

The total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so her weekly earnings are 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is $7425."
"To determine the total number of instructions, we need to calculate the sum of the instructions in both recipes. 

Recipe 1 has 20 instructions. Since Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, we can calculate the number of instructions in Recipe 2 by multiplying the number of instructions in Recipe 1 by 2. 

20 * 2 = 40

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes to find the total.

20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, we multiply the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3), which gives us 43 * 3 = 129. 

Next, we multiply the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4), which gives us 23 * 4 = 92.

Finally, we add the results of these two multiplications together: 129 + 92 = 221.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to consider the cost of the cell phones and the interest charged on each unit.

The cost of each cell phone is $150, and a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. To find the interest, we multiply the cost by the interest rate: $150 * 0.02 = $3.

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is the cost plus the interest: $150 + $3 = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay each month is 5 * $153 = $765.

The answer is: $765"

$33 + $17 + $36 = $86

The final answer is: $86"
"To find the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the concept of a geometric sequence. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as a sequence: 16, 8, 4, 2.

The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

Now, to find the average, we divide the sum by the number of terms:
Average = S / n
Average = 30 / 4
Average = 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 / 110 = 8.27 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the amount of laundry each individual does, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D, Sarah does as S, and Raymond does as R. We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we can write an equation:

S = 4D

We also know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can write another equation:

R = S/2

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can substitute this value into the first equation:

400 = 4D

To solve for D, we can divide both sides by 4:

D = 400/4
D = 100

Now that we know David's laundry amount, we can find Sarah's laundry amount using the first equation:

S = 4D
S = 4(100)
S = 400

Finally, we can find Raymond's laundry amount using the second equation:

R = S/2
R = 400/2
R = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = R - D
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, let's analyze the prices of the available packages.

We have two options: packages of 3 for $2.50 and packages of 2 for $1. 

To calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in each option, we can divide 18 by the number of flowers per package and multiply by the price per package.

For packages of 3 for $2.50:
18 ÷ 3 = 6
6 * $2.50 = $15

For packages of 2 for $1:
18 ÷ 2 = 9
9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, we can see that buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the more cost-effective option, as it results in a lower total cost.

The amount of money saved by choosing the better option is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is $6."
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to find 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

First, we find 30% of $100 by multiplying 0.3 and $100, which equals $30. 

Then, we subtract $30 from the original cost of $100 to get the cost after the discount.

$100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find the amount of water left, we first calculate the total amount of water the two girls received. Since they each received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can multiply 24 by 1/6.

24 * 1/6 = 4 liters

Next, we add the 6 liters the boy received to the amount the girls received:
4 + 6 = 10 liters

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water given from the initial 24 liters:
24 - 10 = 14 liters

The amount of water left is 14 liters."
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we must consider the sequence of events that affected his sticker collection.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 stickers from a store and received 23 stickers as a birthday gift. This results in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers for a greeting card. To find the final count, we must subtract these amounts from the total: 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first. 

We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, let's add their weights together:
125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds

The final answer is 623."
"To calculate the total number of thorns, we can use the fundamental principles of multiplication. 

We have 3 rose bushes, each containing 25 roses. Since each rose has 8 thorns, we can multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75.

Next, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The final answer is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent the number of games lost as 'x'. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we have found the value of 'x', we can determine the number of games won by substituting 'x' into the expression 'x + 8'. 

x + 8 = 7 + 8
x + 8 = 15

Therefore, the number of games won is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Since Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

As he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

Let's break it down:

The first time it rang for 4 times.
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year.

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

The final answer is: $1556.25"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is 8,000."
"To determine the number of guests who will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests, as 1/4 don't show up. 

We can find 3/4 of 16 by multiplying 16 by 3/4, which is equivalent to (3/4) * 16 = 12.

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply 12 by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags required. This is equal to 12 * 0.75 = 9.

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we must consider the eating habits of both adults and children. 

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad required for the adults. Since each adult consumes 10 pounds, we multiply the number of adults by this amount: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad required for the children. It is given that children eat half as much as adults, so we multiply the number of children by half of the adult amount: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of pets each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C, Marcia has as M, and Jan has as J.

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4.

We are also given that Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so M = C + 2.

Substituting the value of C into the equation for M, we get M = 4 + 2 = 6.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so J = 3M.

Substituting the value of M into the equation for J, we get J = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the ages of the children as A (Amy), J (Jackson), C (Corey), and J (James).

We are given the following information:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. J = C - 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)

We can substitute the expression for A from equation (1) into equation (2) to get:

J + 5 = C - 2

Now, we can substitute the expression for J from equation (3) into the above equation:

C - 1 + 5 = C - 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 4 = C - 2

Subtracting C from both sides, we get:

4 = -2

This is a contradiction, which means that the given information is inconsistent. However, we can still find the value of J by using the fact that J = C - 1.

Since we know that James is 10 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation J = C - 1:

10 = C - 1

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

11 = C

Now that we know C, we can find J:

J = C - 1
J = 11 - 1
J = 10

However, we are asked to find the age of Jackson, not James. Since J = C - 1, we can substitute the value of C into this equation:

J = 11 - 1
J = 10

But we know that J = 10 is the age of James, not Jackson. We can use the first equation A = J + 5 to find the age of Amy:

A = J + 5
A = 10 + 5
A = 15

Now, we can use the second equation A = C - 2 to find the age of Corey:

A = C - 2
15 = C - 2

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

17 = C

Now that we know C, we can find J:

J = C - 1
J = 17 - 1
J = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Gerald's new time after his diet change. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We are given that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can write an equation:

R = D + C - 12

We are also given that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write another equation:

C = 2D

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

R = D + 2D - 12
R = 3D - 12

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

R = 3(60) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first determine the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Let's calculate the number of girls: 
Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we can calculate 2/3 of Harry's sleep hours and then subtract that from Harry's total hours.

First, we find 2/3 of 9 hours:
(2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from Harry's total hours:
9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we first need to establish the total volume of tomatoes that Freda started with. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking the sauce, we can calculate the original volume of the tomatoes as follows:

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the resulting sauce is half of the original volume, which is 32 ounces. This can be represented as:

x / 2 = 32

To find the original volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 32 * 2
x = 64 ounces

Now that we know the original volume of the tomatoes, we can calculate the number of tomatoes used. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes, we can divide the original volume of the tomatoes by 16 and then multiply by 3:

Number of tomatoes = (64 / 16) * 3
= 4 * 3
= 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. So, the number of potted plants she will have left is 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, we can express this as 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the sum of the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has to complete the reading:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water per day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 5 glasses of water. 

On weekends, he drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday but not on Sunday. 

The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of his weekday consumption and his weekend consumption: 5 (weekdays) + 1 (Saturday) = 6 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the concept of proportionality. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles.

Let's denote the unknown time as x. The proportion can be set up as follows:

3 miles / 10 minutes = 42 miles / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 42 * 10
3x = 420
x = 420 / 3
x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find a quarter of 1000, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces. These pieces are placed on the board.

Next, we subtract the placed pieces from the total: 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Then, we find a third of the remaining pieces: 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces. These pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

Finally, we subtract the placed pieces from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is 500."
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Since Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. Given that Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's amount by 3, resulting in 15 cookies. 

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by adding Amir's and Cody's consumption: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of the box by subtracting the wall thickness from the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated using the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height
Volume = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 identical boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we must first calculate the total time spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The sum of these times is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Converting 1.5 hours to minutes yields 90 minutes.

Dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes results in 3 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Since he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, the number of cookies he bakes this year is 2x.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he bakes this year is 2x + 15.

He then drops 5 cookies, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies. We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the number of gallons by the cashback amount per gallon: 10 * $0.20 = $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost to find the final amount: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat takes on water and then multiply it by the total distance Julia rowed.

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the rate of water intake per foot, we can divide 2 liters by 10 feet:
2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot

Since Julia rowed a total of 64 feet, we can multiply the rate by the total distance:
0.2 liters/foot x 64 feet = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.8}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem into its components. 

First, we need to find the total number of lessons per day. Since there are 4 teachers, each using the whiteboard 2 times a day, the total number of lessons per day is 4 x 2 = 8.

Next, we need to find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, and there are 8 lessons per day, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 8 x 3 = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has, we can use the formula for calculating the total number of flowers:

Total flowers = (Number of flowers planted per day) * (Number of days) - (Number of flowers that did not grow)

In this case, the number of flowers planted per day is 2, the number of days is 15, and the number of flowers that did not grow is 5.

Total flowers = (2) * (15) - (5)
Total flowers = 30 - 5
Total flowers = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and that this is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold. Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as y. We can express this relationship as an equation:

6y = 1800

To find the value of y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

y = 1800 / 6
y = 300

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. We can express this as another equation:

y = 50x

Substituting the value of y we found earlier, we get:

300 = 50x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

We then calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, we add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the value of one part of the ratio. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 20 to find the value of one part:
120 ÷ 20 = 6

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 42"
"To calculate the total amount John paid, we can use the formula for multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes per child (2) by the number of children (3) to find the total number of pairs of shoes: 2 * 3 = 6.

Next, we multiply the total number of pairs of shoes (6) by the cost per pair ($60) to find the total amount John paid: 6 * $60 = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as x.

We know that the total number of vehicles is 30, and each container has 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles is equal to the sum of the vehicles in the initial containers and the vehicles in the containers imported on the second day.

The initial containers had 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. The total number of vehicles is 30, so the number of vehicles in the containers imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we must first calculate the number of sheets he uses per week. Since there are 30 sheets in a pad and he uses 2 pads per week, we can multiply these two values:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we must consider the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a 4-week month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we know she slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so we can calculate the total hours for those days as follows:

8 - 2 = 6 hours for Tuesday
6 - 2 = 4 hours for Wednesday

The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, we can calculate the total hours for the remaining days as follows:

5 + 1 = 6 hours for Thursday
6 + 1 = 7 hours for Friday
7 + 1 = 8 hours for Saturday
8 + 1 = 9 hours for Sunday

Now, we can add up the hours for each day to find the total hours slept:

8 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours separately.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour. We can use the formula: distance = speed × time. Therefore, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 5 miles per hour. Using the same formula, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two time periods:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60. This means she put stamps on 60/3 = 20 letters.

After putting stamps on 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters becomes x + 20.

We are also given that the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. We know that she initially had some spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can simply add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. Let's represent the number of chicken sausages as 'x'. Then, the number of fish sausages can be represented as 'x + 6'. 

The total number of sausages is the sum of the chicken sausages and fish sausages, which is x + (x + 6). 

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 6. 

We are given that the number of chicken sausages is 38. So, we can substitute x = 38 into the equation 2x + 6.

2(38) + 6 = 76 + 6 = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To find the total number of friends, we can simply add the number of friends each individual has. 

Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. This means Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 + 70 = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O. We know that:

1. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs: W = 3P
2. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon: O = W - 5
3. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

We can express the total cost of the items Dillon buys as:

Total Cost = (4W) + (20P) + (10O)

Substituting the expressions for W and O from the first two equations, we get:

Total Cost = (4(3P)) + (20P) + (10(3P - 5))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Total Cost = 12P + 20P + 30P - 50
Total Cost = 62P - 50

Since we know that a pepper costs 15$, we can substitute P = 15 into the expression:

Total Cost = 62(15) - 50
Total Cost = 930 - 50
Total Cost = 880

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from both patients and doctors.

First, we convert the total time spent on patients from minutes to hours: 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 12,000 minutes by 60 to get 200 hours.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from patients: 500 people * $200/person = $100,000.

The total revenue from doctors is calculated by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000.

The total cost is the sum of the revenue from doctors: $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $100,000."
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to find one-third of the initial number of elves. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. This means 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. 

Now, we subtract the elves who quit from the initial number: 60 - 20 = 40.

Next, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we can calculate the expenditure in June by subtracting $60 from the expenditure in May.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

The total expenditure is the sum of the expenditures in May and June, which is $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we must consider the individual ticket expenditures for each activity.

Pam's roller coaster rides resulted in 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred's roller coaster rides yielded 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times, which equates to 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

The total number of tickets used is the sum of these expenditures: 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the miles walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday. 

Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M and the miles walked on Tuesday as T. We know that T = 6M. Given that M = 4, we can find T by multiplying 4 by 6, which equals 24. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday: M + T + W = 41, where W represents the miles walked on Wednesday. Substituting the values of M and T, we get 4 + 24 + W = 41.

To solve for W, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation: W = 41 - 28. This simplifies to W = 13.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes in a year, we can multiply the number of car washes per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of car washes per month (4) by the number of months in a year (12):
4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year
2. Multiply the result by the cost of each car wash ($15):
48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the number of video games each person has. Let's denote the number of video games Brian has as B and the number of video games Bobby has as b.

We are given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be expressed as:

b = 3B - 5

We are also given that Brian has 20 video games initially, but he lost 5 right before the comparison was made. So, we can represent the number of video games Brian has now as B - 5.

Substituting B - 5 for B in the equation b = 3B - 5, we get:

b = 3(B - 5) - 5
b = 3B - 15 - 5
b = 3B - 20

Now, we can equate this expression to the number of video games Brian has, which is 15:

15 = 3B - 20

To solve for B, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

15 + 20 = 3B - 20 + 20
35 = 3B

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of B:

B = 35 / 3
B = 11.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a video game, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of video games Bobby has, which is represented by the expression b = 3B - 5.

Substituting B = 11.67 into the expression for b, we get:

b = 3(11.67) - 5
b = 35.01 - 5
b = 30.01

Since we can't have a fraction of a video game, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact number of video games Bobby has.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we must first calculate the total number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of unicorns by 1/3.

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

Next, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to consider the cost of each item and the additional fees.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which equals $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions Mark completed in both tests. We know he completed 40 questions in the first test and 30 questions in the second test. 

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions in both tests. The first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions.

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests.

Questions left incomplete = Total questions in both tests - Total questions completed
= 175 - 70
= 105

The final answer is 105."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of blue gumballs as 'b' and the number of pink gumballs as 'p'. We are given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as an equation:

p = 4b + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute b = 12 into the equation:

p = 4(12) + 22
p = 48 + 22
p = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the different types of bees in the hive.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given the following information:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. From equation (2), we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Substituting this expression into equation (1), we get:
W = 2(2Q) = 4Q

Now, substitute the expressions for W and B into equation (3):
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees."
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of hours worked in a week by the hourly wage. 

First, we calculate the total hours worked in a week: 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Next, we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The total cost of the food items is $5 (milk and eggs). The non-food items are light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), and roach traps ($4), totaling $10. 

The tax rate is 10%, so we calculate the tax amount as $10 * 0.10 = $1. 

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11. 

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items (including tax): $5 + $11 = $16.

The total cost of everything is $16."
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients.

Let's denote the number of clients as 'n'. Since each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bleach bottles and packs of cloths can be expressed as 2n and n, respectively.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 2n * $2 = $4n.
The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is n * $5 = $5n.

Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths
Total expenses = $4n + $5n
Total expenses = $9n

We are given that Kim has 3 clients initially and is talking to 5 more potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. So, n = 8.

Total expenses = $9n
Total expenses = $9 * 8
Total expenses = $72

The total income is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we must first calculate the total number of pineapples per year. 

Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year as follows:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

However, John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we must first calculate the number of pieces in each box. 

The first box contains 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it contains 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it contains 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to determine the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours. Let's denote this number as x. We know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. This means 1/2 * x bees return in the next 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2x bees.

We also know that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. This means that the bees that left in the first 6 hours (x) and the bees that left in the next 6 hours (x/2) are the ones that return in the last 6 hours.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:

x + (x/2) = total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours

We also know that the total number of bees that left in the first 3 periods is 30 + (x/2) + 2x. Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the first 3 periods and hadn't returned yet is 30 + x + x = 30 + 2x.

The number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left in the first 3 periods and hadn't returned yet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) = 30 + 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(3/2)x = 30

Multiplying both sides by 2/3, we get:

x = 20

Now that we know x, we can find the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:

x + (x/2) = 20 + (20/2) = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, Debra saw 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Final answer: 30"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we must calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

To find the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we add the total cost to the change she received: $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express Charlie's friends in terms of 'x' as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

James' friends = 4x
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle.

First, we'll calculate the cost for bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * 25 cents = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $1.25
Next, we'll calculate the cost for tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25
Lastly, we'll calculate the cost for the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25

Now, let's add the amounts together: $1.25 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $3.75

The final answer is: $3.75"
"To calculate the total cost of the cookies, we can multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply by the cost per cookie.

First, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. Let's start with the last event: Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.

Next, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. Then, 1/3 of 'x' is 6. To find 'x', we can multiply 6 by 3, which gives us 18. So, the raccoon ate 2/3 of 18, which is 12 fries. The remaining fries before the raccoon ate 18 - 12 = 6.

Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries before the pigeons ate 6 + 9 = 15.

The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. Let's call the fries Dave ate 'y'. Then, the seagull ate y/2 fries. We know that the seagull ate 7 fries, so y/2 = 7. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us y = 14. Dave initially ate 14 fries.

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 14 + 7 = 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can break down his class schedule into two categories: 3-hour days and 4-hour days.

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week for these days. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 9 * 3 = 27 hours per week on these days.

On the other hand, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can multiply the number of hours he spends per week on each type of day by the number of weeks in a semester.

For the 3-hour days, Kimo spends 27 * 16 = 432 hours. For the 4-hour days, he spends 8 * 16 = 128 hours.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 432 + 128 = 560 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to a common unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches / 12 inches/foot = 240 feet.

Now, we can add the total length of each type of baked good to find the overall length.

Total length = 10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 240 feet (baguettes) = 260 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must calculate the combined monthly requirement of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas require 400 bananas per month, and the baboons require 100 bananas per month. 

First, we add the monthly requirements: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we must calculate the total distance each individual ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran (15) by the length of the football field (100 yards), which equals 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated by first determining the total distance she ran back and forth on the entire field (100 yards * 2 = 200 yards), and then adding the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back (80 yards * 34 times = 2720 yards). Therefore, her total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 2920 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2920 - 1500 = 1420 yards.

The final answer is: 1420"
"To determine the total cost of Raphael's school supplies, we must calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we must consider the initial count and the changes that occurred.

Finn initially observed 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles retreated to under a rock. To find the current count, we must add the number of tadpoles that emerged and subtract the number that retreated.

The calculation is as follows:

11 (initial tadpoles) + 6 (tadpoles that emerged) - 2 (tadpoles that retreated) = 15

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, resulting in a total of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we are told that the depth on Wednesday is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24 feet, we can multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To determine the total number of fish caught, we must first calculate the number of fish each individual caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, resulting in 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Furthermore, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, yielding 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is the sum of their individual totals: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $20
r = monthly increase rate = 20% = 0.20
n = number of months = 36

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^36
A = 20(1.20)^36
A ≈ 20 * 6.6524
A ≈ $132.48

However, this method assumes a continuous compounding of the monthly increase. To account for the discrete compounding, we can use the formula:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $20
r = monthly increase rate = 20% = 0.20
n = number of months = 36

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^36
A = 20(1.20)^36
A ≈ 20 * 6.6524
A ≈ $132.48

Alternatively, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $20
r = monthly increase rate = 20% = 0.20
n = number of months = 36

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^36
A = 20(1.20)^36
A ≈ 20 * 6.6524
A ≈ $132.48

A ≈ 20 * 6.6524
A ≈ $132.48

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $132.48."
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to establish the cost of each type of toy.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in earnings between doing taxes oneself and hiring an accountant, we must consider the lost income from reduced freelance work and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, calculate the lost income from reduced freelance work. Jackie loses 3 hours of work at $35 per hour, resulting in a loss of:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Next, subtract the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90.

$105 (lost income) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we must first calculate the total cost of the computer accessories. 

The cost of the computer is €1090, the scanner is €157, the CD burner is €74, and the printer is €102. 

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find the amount left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is €77."
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we can divide the total number of eggs required (15) by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting (3).

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the necessary eggs for the Spanish flans."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Seth's current age be x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age is x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify, multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4 + x + 4 = 56

Combine like terms:

3x + 8 = 56

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the amount of money Ethel has as 'x'. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can express Jimmy's money as 2x + 2.

We are given that Ethel has $8, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 2 = 8

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

2x = 6

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 3

Now that we know Ethel has $3, we can find Jimmy's money by substituting x into the equation 2x + 2:

2(3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8

Therefore, Jimmy has $8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total miles walked in a week, we must consider the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately. 

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day, and there are 5 weekdays. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day, and there are 2 weekend days. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

The total miles walked in a week is the sum of the miles walked on weekdays and weekends, which is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is 120."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we must calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

First, we calculate the legs of the spiders: 80 spiders with 8 legs each yield 80 x 8 = 640 legs.

Next, we calculate the legs of the insects: 90 insects with 6 legs each yield 90 x 6 = 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each yield 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the birds using variables. Let's denote Sally Thirty-two's age as x. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four's age is also x. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red's age is 2x. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two's age is 2x + 3.

We are given that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old, so x = 8. We can now substitute this value into the expressions for the other birds' ages:

- Sally Four's age: 8
- Granny Red's age: 2 * 8 = 16
- Sally Two's age: 2 * 8 + 3 = 19

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine the total annual payment, we need to calculate the total monthly payment first. 

The minimum payment for student loans is $300, credit card's minimum is $200, and mortgage's minimum is $500. Adding these together gives us a total minimum payment of $1000.

To find 50% of this total, we multiply by 0.5: 0.5 x $1000 = $500.

Now, we add this 50% increase to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find the annual payment, we multiply this amount by 12: $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 

First, we convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds. Then, we add the time to cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

Converting the total time to minutes for easier understanding: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{95}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The total revenue is the revenue per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons, so the total revenue is $10x. The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5x.

We are given that the profit is $25, which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5x = $25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 5

Since x represents the number of gallons, we can multiply it by the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon to find the total cost of lemons:

Total cost of lemons = $5x
= $5 * 5
= $25

Therefore, Juan and his brother spent $25 on lemons.

$25"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we must first calculate the total number of Chinese participants. 

The total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, there are 100 Chinese girls on the team."
"To determine Zaid's remaining balance, we must first calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel. 

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. The total amount spent on rent and car fuel is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount after these expenses is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all his expenses and donations."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of crabs each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

We are given that B = 40 and M = B - 4. Substituting the value of B into the equation for M, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36.

We are also given that R = M + 10. Substituting the value of M into this equation, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To calculate the total earnings for the first two weeks, we can use the formula: Total Earnings = (Number of hours worked in the first week) * Hourly wage + (Number of hours worked in the second week) * Hourly wage.

Given that Lloyd earns $10 per hour, worked 5 hours in the first week, and 8 hours in the second week, we can plug these values into the formula:

Total Earnings = (5 hours * $10/hour) + (8 hours * $10/hour)
Total Earnings = $50 + $80
Total Earnings = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we can use the fact that the winner received 3/4 of the total votes. 

Let's denote the total number of votes as 'x'. Since the winner received 3/4 of the total votes, we can set up the equation:

Winner's votes = (3/4)x

We know the total number of votes is 80, so we can set up the equation:

(3/4)x = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

Now that we know the total number of votes, we can find the number of votes the loser got by subtracting the winner's votes from the total:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be represented as 4x. We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies can be represented as 5x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to solve for x. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40, which gives us 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm is 160."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

From the given information, we have two key pieces of data:

1. Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be represented as:
   M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5

Substituting J = 30 into the equation, we get:
   M - 2 = (30 / 2) + 5
   M - 2 = 15 + 5
   M - 2 = 20
   M = 22

Now that we know Mark's current age, we can find Jean's age:
   E = M + 2
   E = 22 + 2
   E = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team.

The first runner on the less well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. 

The time for each runner on the less well-rounded team can be calculated as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The difference in total time between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"When Jerry rolls a six-sided die, we can calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row can be calculated by multiplying the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (1/2) by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 1/2), resulting in (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked, we can use the concept of equivalent ratios. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can express this relationship as a ratio: Jenna's apples : mom's apples = 1 : 2.

Given that her mom picked 20 apples, we can set up a proportion to find Jenna's apples:

Jenna's apples / mom's apples = 1 / 2
Jenna's apples / 20 = 1 / 2

To solve for Jenna's apples, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

Jenna's apples = (1/2) * 20
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

Therefore, the total number of apples picked is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the total number of straw used. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used is 160, so we can set up the equation:

18x + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine like terms:

18x + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18x = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 5

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay to Benedict, we need to determine the interest accrued over 3 months. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months. 

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should pay.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is 30x. The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation, which is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total cost of the food, we can subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is 2 times the cost of one ride.
Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we can divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we must first convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for the flock of ducks, we must divide the total weekly requirement by the number of days in a week.

The total weekly requirement is 3.5 pounds, and there are 7 days in a week. 

Dividing the total weekly requirement by the number of days in a week yields:

3.5 pounds ÷ 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day

Therefore, the ducks require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years. 

First, we calculate the net number of trees Tom adds each year by subtracting the number of trees he chops down from the number of trees he plants:

10 trees (planted) - 2 trees (chopped down) = 8 trees per year

Since Tom plants 8 trees per year for 10 years, we multiply 8 by 10:

8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees

Next, we calculate 30% of the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years. To do this, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, we can break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

The 6 flamingos taken back were then painted white and put back out, resulting in 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30, and the total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the crayons. 

She requires 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 

The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon: 
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Violetta has $20. 
The change can be found by subtracting the total cost from the amount she has: 
Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the cost of a pen, we must combine the costs of a pencil and an eraser. 

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

The cost of a pen is the sum of these two values: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to divide the total amount of carrots available by the number of restaurants and then subtract the result from the total amount of carrots available.

First, we divide the total amount of carrots available (200 pounds) by the number of restaurants (40):

200 pounds ÷ 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed as:

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the concept of set theory. The total population consists of men, women, and children. By subtracting the combined number of men and women from the total population, we can isolate the number of children.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

The number of children can be found by subtracting the sum of men and women from the total population:

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of cards collected in the first month. Since Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, we multiply the initial number of cards by 3: 20 * 3 = 60 cards.

Next, we determine the number of cards collected in the second month. We know she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so we subtract 20 from the number of cards collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, we calculate the number of cards collected in the third month. Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. We add the number of cards collected in the first and second months, then multiply by 2: (60 + 40) * 2 = 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The total number of cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can express the total number of sentences as 2x. We know that 2x = 1000, so x = 500.

The rate for Publisher A is 5 cents per sentence, and the rate for Publisher B is twice that amount, which is 10 cents per sentence. We can express Mark's earnings from each publisher as 5x (for Publisher A) and 10x (for Publisher B).

Mark's total earnings can be represented as 5x + 10x. Since we know that x = 500, we can substitute this value into the equation:

5(500) + 10(500) = 2500 + 5000 = 7500

Therefore, Mark's weekly earnings are 7500 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must calculate the morning and afternoon amounts separately and then sum them.

First, we calculate the morning amount: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

Next, we calculate the afternoon amount: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the morning and afternoon amounts together: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

Therefore, Baldur receives 55 liters of water every day.

The final answer is 55."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

The award is a 5% raise in salary, but since it's a one-time monetary reward, it's not a raise in salary. To find the monetary value of the 5% raise, we can calculate 5% of his annual salary:

5% of $104,000 = 0.05 * $104,000 = $5,200

However, the award amount is $5,000, which is less than the calculated raise. This suggests that the award is not a raise, but rather a separate monetary reward.

To find John's total earnings for the year, we simply add the award amount to his annual salary:

$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $109,000.

Final answer: $109,000"
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced. Since each acre yields 5 tons of grapes, and there are 10 acres, we can multiply these values to obtain the total tons.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we must convert the total tons into barrels, as each ton yields 2 barrels of wine. To do this, we multiply the total tons by 2.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. She then acquired 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, resulting in 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. Additionally, she purchased 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, yielding 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens together:
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To calculate the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we must first determine the total score of the first five tests. 

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the total score, we add these numbers together: 
89 + 71 = 160
160 + 92 = 252
252 + 100 = 352
352 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, we subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

To achieve an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. We multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This equates to a total of 5 * 4 = 20 rides. Since each ride was 25 kilometers, the total distance covered in this period is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal reduced his frequency to 2 times a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers per ride. This resulted in 2 * 3 = 6 rides. Therefore, the total distance covered in this period is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

To find the overall total, we add the distances from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. This can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

Next, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday, which is five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. This can be expressed as 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the cost of each cup is 'x'. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000.

We can set up the equation as follows:

20 * 12 * x = 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240x = 4800

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 240:

x = 4800 / 240

x = 20

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as 'x'. Since she earns $4 per session, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4x.

We know that she needs to earn a total of $60 to buy the jacket and shoes. She already has $10 saved, so the amount she needs to earn from babysitting is $60 - $10 = $50.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session, the number of babysitting sessions required to earn $50 is $50 / $5 = 10.

The total amount she needs to earn is the sum of the amount she earns from mowing the lawn and babysitting, which is $4x + $50. We know that this total amount should be equal to $60. So, we can set up the equation:

$4x + $50 = $60

Subtracting $50 from both sides gives us:

$4x = $10

Dividing both sides by $4 gives us:

x = $10 / $4
x = 2.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a lawn mowing session, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn at least 3 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 3"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can start by finding the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this total is 250.

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day:

x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150

The total number of customers on the third day is given as 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day:

500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is 250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative.

Let's re-evaluate the system of equations. We can rewrite the first equation as 2x - 16 = 4y and the second equation as x - 16 = y. We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16.

Let's try a different approach. We can rewrite the first equation as 2x - 16 = 4y and the second equation as x - 16 = y. We can solve the system of equations by substituting 2y + 16 for x in the first equation: 2(2y + 16) - 16 = 4y. Simplifying, we get 4y + 32 - 16 = 4y. This simplifies to 16 = 0, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption was incorrect.

Let's try again. We can rewrite the first equation as 2x - 16 = 4y and the second equation as x - 16 = y. We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16.

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire. This can be done by adding the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she must work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori must work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

First, we calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of the initial amount. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay:

$165 x 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can simply add the number of roses and dahlias.

Let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of dahlias as D. We are given that R = 4 and D = R + 7.

We can substitute the value of R into the equation for D: D = 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding R and D: Total = R + D = 4 + 11 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can start by determining their current ages.

Let's denote Harriet's age as H, Zack's age as Z, and Adrian's age as A. We are given that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can express this as:

H = (1/2)Z
Z = 2H

We are also given that Harriet is 21 years old now, so we can substitute this value into the first equation:

21 = (1/2)Z
Z = 21 * 2
Z = 42

Now that we know Zack's age, we can find Adrian's age, which is three times Harriet's age:

A = 3H
A = 3 * 21
A = 63

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (H + Z + A) / 3 = (21 + 42 + 63) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote Jojo's score as J, Naomi's score as N, Yuri's score as Y, and Brianna's score as B.

We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by all four students is 251: J + N + Y + B = 251
2. Naomi scored 68 points: N = 68
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points: Y = (1/2)N + 10
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi: B = N + 17

We can substitute the values of N, Y, and B into the first equation:

J + 68 + ((1/2)68 + 10) + (68 + 17) = 251

Simplifying the equation:

J + 68 + 34 + 10 + 85 = 251

Combine like terms:

J + 217 = 251

Subtract 217 from both sides:

J = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the total time spent on these activities, we must calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles. Since it takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle and Carmen solved 3 of them, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles. It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle, and Carmen solved 8 of them, so the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we must first calculate the remaining water after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters.

The remaining water is 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Next, we need to find the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice the remaining water. This can be calculated as 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums: 90 - 40 = 50.

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total: 90 + 50 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of $15,000.

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we must calculate the individual costs and then add them together.

Carlos' cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the canoe (3) by the hourly rate ($30). This yields 3 * $30 = $90.

Similarly, Benji's cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours he used the banana boat raft (5) by the hourly rate ($18). This results in 5 * $18 = $90.

To find the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we must consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, we can calculate the car trip duration as 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip, which is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days for the round trip is 9 days."
"To calculate the probability of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to consider the individual components and their respective costs.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Next, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Then, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Finally, adding the 2 sauces for $0.50 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

The upgrade adds $3.00 to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which reduces the total to $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, and her mom's rate is half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. Therefore, their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute) to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle.

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

This means 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find the number of remaining watermelons, we subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax, which is 10% of the cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10, which equals $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car. With 12 cars, the total registration fees are 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we must first establish the number of shells she collected on Monday. Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday as follows:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Next, we need to calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. It is given that she collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday as follows:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we must first calculate the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we can add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. 

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean. 
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines required, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he consumes 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

The total number of tomatoes consumed per day is 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day. 

To find the total number of tomatoes consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To determine the number of vines required, we divide the total number of tomatoes consumed per week by the number of tomatoes produced per vine: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's tomato requirements.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required. With 20 friends and each friend needing 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we can find the number of pizzas needed by dividing the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Since Ram can make one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens he has (25) by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This calculation yields a quotient of 5, indicating that Ram can create 5 full pens from the initial 25 pens. As a result, he will have a total of 5 pens.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to find the total amount of money Johnny had before investing. He started with $20 and added $10 to it, resulting in a total of $30.

Next, we know that the money tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial total by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can represent their ages algebraically. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as (J + 5) - 2.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages:

Joan's age: J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age: (J + 5) - 2 = (20 + 5) - 2 = 23

Now, let's find the sum of their ages:
J + (J + 5) + ((J + 5) - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. This is 30% of the total number of students, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students: (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's represent the number of candies Robert has as 'r'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2r.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2r = 54 to find the value of r.

Solving for r, we get r = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's amount: James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters written and the time spent writing each letter.

Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. As he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters written per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:

450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

Let's denote the number of fries Griffin had initially as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24
2. K = 5
3. B = 2K
4. C = K - 3
5. G - K + x + C = 27

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

24 - 5 + x + (5 - 3) = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 + x + 2 = 27

Combine like terms:

21 + x = 27

Subtract 21 from both sides:

x = 6

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 6 fries.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to first determine the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, which equals 24 hours per week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To find the discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula: Total Cost = Number of Bags * Weight per Bag * Cost per Pound.

Given:
Number of Bags = 4
Weight per Bag = 50 pounds
Cost per Pound = $1.50

Total Cost = 4 * 50 * $1.50
Total Cost = 200 * $1.50
Total Cost = $300

Therefore, the total cost is $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. We can find the total number of cookies her sister ate by adding these two values: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we can multiply her sister's Monday cookies by 4 to find Sue's Monday cookies: 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we can multiply her sister's Tuesday cookies by 2 to find Sue's Tuesday cookies: 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by Sue by adding her Monday and Tuesday cookies: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies eaten by her sister, we simply add her Monday and Tuesday cookies: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue by multiplying her total cookies by 200: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Similarly, we can find the total calories consumed by her sister by multiplying her total cookies by 200: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

Finally, we can find the difference in calories consumed by subtracting her sister's calories from Sue's calories: 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we can start by determining the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

Since the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we must consider the changes in the app count. 

First, we subtract the number of apps deleted from the initial count: 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps downloaded to this result: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: wolves and cougars.

First, we know that Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Then, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, which means he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves. Additionally, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves, and 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 55 + 27 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can use a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

We start with Bill's initial floor, which is 3. We then multiply this by 4, resulting in 12. Finally, we add 6 to this product, yielding 18.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply 21 by 4 to find the number of times Robert went down the slide.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we must first calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas purchases 40 cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls.

The initial number of cows per stall is 20. When 40 new cows are added, the total number of cows per stall becomes:
20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) = 60 cows per stall.

Now, we can calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls:
60 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 480 cows.

The final answer is 480."
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to consider the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

First, let's calculate the total value of the coins:

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5

Next, we add the value of the dollar bills: $5 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee separately. 

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of bananas as B.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation:
A = J + 8

We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write another equation:
A = 0.5B

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write:
B = A + 4

Now we have three equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:
J + 8 = 0.5B

We can then substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
B = (J + 8) + 4
B = J + 12

Now we can substitute the expression for B into the first equation:
J + 8 = 0.5(J + 12)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
J + 8 = 0.5J + 6
0.5J = 2
J = 4

Now that we have found J, we can find A:
A = J + 8
A = 4 + 8
A = 12

We can then find B:
B = J + 12
B = 4 + 12
B = 16

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 12 apples + 16 bananas = 28 fruits
Jamal: 4 apples + 16 bananas = 20 fruits

Total number of fruits: 28 + 20 = 48

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. This can be found by adding the number of cookies she plans to make today to the number of cookies she plans to make tomorrow.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen cookies, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12 and then multiplying by 2.

Total flour needed = (66 cookies / 12) * 2 cups
= 5.5 * 2 cups
= 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to first find two thirds of the pennies in the cup. 

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 * 50 = 250. 

Next, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now possesses 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of trees in each yard. We know Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees as 6 / 2 = 3.

Next, we're told that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find Harry's trees, we multiply Ferdinand's trees by 2 and then add 5: 2 * 3 + 5 = 11.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard. We can do this by subtracting Ferdinand's trees from Harry's trees: 11 - 3 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can simply add up the individual amounts.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to determine the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

Adding the total additional fees to the selling price, we get $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to consider the transfer fees and brokerage fee as a percentage of the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

The remaining loan amount is $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. However, since Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount, we need to subtract this from the remaining loan amount to find the net proceeds.

Net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. This is 20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, the time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. 

Therefore, the time to cook the chicken is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we add the time to heat up the oil and the time to cook the chicken to get the total time.

Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50): 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15): 
$75 * 15 = $1125

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads: 
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The total amount spent on buying all the ads is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we must first identify the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of balls by 2.

Total number of balls = 16
Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary received, we must calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag, however, has a hole in it, resulting in half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, which is 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary received is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows, we must consider the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 3 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 6 windows per house. With 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 windows per house * 2 houses = 12 windows.

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Each house has 4 additional windows, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual item prices: 
Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

Therefore, the cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by finding the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

Let's denote the number of stitches for the collar as C and the number of stitches for the rosette as R. We know that C = 900 / 10 = 90 and R = 2C = 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we can express the total number of stitches for the sweater as the sum of the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as S. We know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. So, we can set up the equation:

S + S + C + R = 1800

Substituting the values of C and R, we get:

2S + 90 + 180 = 1800

Combine like terms:

2S + 270 = 1800

Subtract 270 from both sides:

2S = 1530

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 765

Since there are two sleeves, we can find the number of stitches for each sleeve by dividing the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

S = 765 / 2 = 382.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a stitch, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that the problem might be looking for an exact number of stitches per sleeve, so we'll keep the answer as 382.5 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 382.5."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we must calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet, which equals $800. 

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet, which equals $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400, resulting in a total of $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into parts.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Therefore, Sean has a total of 138 lines to memorize."
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we subtract the cards with the letter A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards with the letter B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

We then find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, we subtract the cards with the letter C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by considering their current combined age. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years can be calculated by adding these two values: (M + 10) + (C + 10).

This can be simplified to M + C + 20. Since we know that M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation, resulting in 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let R represent Ruby's current age and S represent Sam's current age.

The first equation is based on the fact that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To calculate the total amount Peter paid, we need to find the sum of the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars.

The cost of the popsicles can be calculated by multiplying the number of popsicles (20) by the cost per popsicle ($0.25), which equals $5.

The cost of the ice cream bars can be calculated by multiplying the number of ice cream bars (4) by the cost per ice cream bar ($0.50), which equals $2.

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots, we first need to determine the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

We are given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. To find the total number of spots, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on a cobra and add it to the product of the number of mambas and the number of spots on a mamba.

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total number of people, we must consider the team members, coaches, and their guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests. 

First, we calculate the total number of guests: 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests. Then, we add the number of coaches to get the total number of people: 24 guests + 3 coaches = 27 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 27 people / 3 people/pizza = 9 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is 9 pizzas * $15/pizza = $135.

The final answer is: $135"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of beads as 'b'. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so the number of beads used can be represented as:

(1/4)b = 17

To solve for 'b', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

b = 17 * 4
b = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is 68."
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to consider the number of stories each child wrote in the first week and double it for the second week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and 20 x 2 = 40 stories in the second week. 
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and 40 x 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and 60 x 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can start by finding his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age as follows:

Current age = 2 * Ann's age
Current age = 2 * 9
Current age = 18 years

Now, to find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
Age in 3 years = Current age + 3
Age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Age in 3 years = 21 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop, we must first calculate the total amount of money she possesses. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 = 125 cents. Additionally, she has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 

40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. 

The weight of each flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. Therefore, the total weight is:

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the total number of medals given out for counting. Since Ali and Izzy together have 39 medals, we can set up the equation:

10x = 39 + 22 + 17

This equation represents the total number of medals given out, which is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Combine like terms on the right-hand side:

10x = 78

Now, divide both sides by 10 to solve for x:

x = 78 / 10

x = 7.8

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.8}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we must first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars distributed to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars, which are 40 - 24 = 16, are to be shared equally among the children. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 ÷ 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total minutes she works and then multiply it by her earnings per minute.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings by dividing the total minutes she works by 10 and then multiplying by 5.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15
15 * $5 = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we need to calculate their points before and after the extra point distribution.

Initially, we have:
- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

Since all players have more than 20 points, they will receive an extra point each in the fourth round. Therefore, we add 1 to each player's points.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we must first calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, the youngest son washed 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (from the oldest son) + 4 (from the youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Since Will initially bought 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity on both days and add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. 

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, resulting in 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg per week.

Now, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine the number of weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates sold. 

We know that Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. To find the total number of crates sold, we add these values together: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target to find the difference: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is 55."
"To determine the final cost of the desk, we can analyze the bidding process step by step. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. So, the bids were $200, $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids were $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350. To find the total cost of the desk, we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $650

However, we also need to add the cost of the bids made by the other 3 people. 

$50 (first bid) + $50 (second bid) + $50 (third bid) = $150

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen's last bid. 

$650 + $150 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to consider both the distance driven and the bonus paid to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John drives 30 miles to work and back each day, the daily distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the weekly distance is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. Multiplying this by the number of weeks worked in a year (50 weeks), we get 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 bonus per month. With 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

The total cost per year is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he spent exercising on Monday and Sunday.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

When a tabloid is folded in half, it creates two sides: left and right. Each side has 16 pages. However, we must also consider the front and back of each side. 

The left side has 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back, and the right side has 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back. 

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

- The left side contributes 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back, totaling 16 pages.
- The right side contributes 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back, totaling 16 pages.

Adding these together, we get 16 + 16 = 32 pages.

However, we must also account for the fact that the pages are printed on both sides. Since each page is printed on both the front and back, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of pieces of paper needed.

32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper are required to create a 32-page tabloid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. She spent half of her initial $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides.

The total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 = 200

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x = 400

Combine like terms:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 400/3

x = 133.33

Since x represents the number of books sold in the first year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2:

x/2 = 133.33/2

x/2 = 66.67

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year. Each book sells at 20$, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Number of books sold in the second year * 20
= 66.67 * 20
= 1333.33

The final answer is: $1333.33"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the bonus he receives. 

First, we calculate his daily earnings: 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day. Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week. With 4 weeks in April, his total weekly earnings are $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000. 

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the month. Therefore, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate 20 x 0.8, as 80% is equivalent to 0.8.

20 x 0.8 = 16

Therefore, John lost to 16 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. 

Two-thirds of 60 loaves can be calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. This means 40 loaves were sold in the morning. 

The remaining loaves are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate this as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can use a simple proportion. 

Let's denote the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as 'x'. Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 'x' weeks that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we can set up the following proportion:

x weeks / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week / 8 pounds

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

x * 8 = 4 * 2

x * 8 = 8

Now, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 8 / 8

x = 1

Therefore, it will take Sandy 1 week to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is 1."
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated by subtracting the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of extra arms and the number of extra legs.

First, we'll calculate the number of complete 3-day cycles within 15 days. Since 15 divided by 3 equals 5, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we'll calculate the number of complete 5-day cycles within 15 days. Since 15 divided by 5 equals 3, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs. 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

The person will grow a total of 8 new limbs after 15 days."
"To determine the amount Theo has to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items he has purchased. The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500, and then $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items purchased: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000. So, we subtract the total cost of items purchased from his total budget: $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $4000 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we must consider the daily egg consumption of the entire family. 

There are 5 family members in total. Three members consume 3 eggs each day, while the remaining 2 members consume 2 eggs each day. 

First, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 3 members who eat 3 eggs each day: 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 2 members who eat 2 eggs each day: 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups to find the daily total: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total: 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

We are given the following information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old, so Q = 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so J = Q - 3.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so T = J + 5.

Substituting the value of Q into the second equation, we get J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, substituting the value of J into the third equation, we get T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P.

We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, and Cera is currently 46 years old. Therefore, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We can express this as:

N - 6 = (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we find:

N = 26

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can express this as:

P - 6 = 3000(N - 6)

Substituting N = 26 into the equation, we get:

P - 6 = 3000(26 - 6)
P - 6 = 3000(20)
P - 6 = 60000
P = 60006

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60006.

The final answer is: 60006"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of people who attended Martha's party, we must first calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, resulting in 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, yielding 3 x 4 = 12 people. The combined total is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness. Subtracting this from the total number of invited guests, we get 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who were unable to attend had prior commitments. This equates to 8 / 4 = 2 people. Subtracting these individuals from the total number of people who were initially expected to attend, we get 16 - 2 = 14 people.

Therefore, 14 people attended Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we must first determine the volume of the pool. Since the pool is a rectangular prism, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = L * W * H, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height.

Given that the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 5 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1. 

Cost = V * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting B represent the number of boys, G represent the number of girls, and N represent the number of nongendered children. We are given the following information:

1. The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys: G = 3B
2. The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys: N = (1/10)B
3. The classroom has 30 boys: B = 30

We can substitute the value of B into the first two equations to find the values of G and N:

G = 3B
G = 3(30)
G = 90

N = (1/10)B
N = (1/10)(30)
N = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total = B + G + N
Total = 30 + 90 + 3
Total = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we can use the concept of equivalent ratios. Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of electric poles (x) and the number of electric wires (45).

1/3 = x/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Next, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 45/3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of women left at the party, we first need to determine the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we know that 22 men stayed, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' left, and 22 men stayed. Since 3 men left, the number of men who left is 1/4 of 'x'. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people is 12, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = 1/4 * 12 = 3

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 3 = 12

However, this is incorrect as we know 22 men stayed. We can re-evaluate the situation by setting up another equation:

(3/4)x = 22

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

"To determine the cost of the pen, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P. We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, which costs $4. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

M = 1/2 * 4
M = 2

We also know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can express this relationship as:

P = M - 1
P = 2 - 1
P = 1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used. We can set up a proportion to find the number of ice cubes: 13 degrees / 1 ice cube = 65 degrees / x ice cubes. Solving for x, we get x = 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. To find the total weakening, we add the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of old records each person brought as 'x'. Since 5 people traded their records for 7 new ones, we can set up the equation:

2x = 7

This is because each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7/2

x = 3.5

However, since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 3

Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records they brought in is:

5x = 5 * 3
5x = 15

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 15 old records.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

Let's denote the number of junior programmers as J and the number of senior programmers as S. We are given that J = (2/5) * 100 = 40 and S = 100 - J = 60.

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month can be represented as:

Total Salary = (J * $2000) + (S * $2400)

Substituting the values of J and S, we get:

Total Salary = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."

"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events as follows:

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that affect the number of lollipops he has.

First, he eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, reducing his total to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, he purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This increases his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Subsequently, he consumes 3 lollipops that night, resulting in 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find the time it will take to charge 40%, we can set up a proportion:

1% / 3 minutes = 40% / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

x = (40% * 3 minutes) / 1%
x = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a straightforward arithmetic process. 

First, we start with Erin's initial number of lollipops, which is 7. Then, her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, increasing the total to 7 + 10 = 17. Finally, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, resulting in 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is 14."
"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards they received and the discount applied.

The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. This means they received $80 / 20 = 4 rewards. However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B provides a higher net pay of $32,400. To find the difference, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

First, we convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 ÷ 100 = 0.4

Then, we multiply 0.4 by 220: 0.4 * 220 = 88

Next, we divide 88 by 2 to find the number of unmanned ruined castles: 88 ÷ 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."

"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to add up the total number of guns and divide by the number of people.

The total number of guns is the sum of the guns each person has: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

To find the number of guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people: 24 ÷ 4 = 6.

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for suckers and fudge separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amounts together: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we find 50% of the initial price of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. Adding this to the initial price, we get $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate 25% of the new price of $12, which is $12 * 0.25 = $3. Subtracting this from the new price, we get $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we must first establish the quantity consumed by each individual. 

We know that Luke consumed 2 hot dogs. Thomas, having eaten three times more hot dogs than Luke, consumed 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs. Consequently, John, who ate half the amount Thomas consumed, ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we subtract the quantity consumed by Luke from the quantity consumed by John: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of students in the smallest group be x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of cows as x and the number of chickens as 2x, since there are twice as many chickens as cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of chickens:

2x = 2(20) = 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
= (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
= 80 + 80
= 160

Therefore, the total number of legs is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has when he starts juggling on stage, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls at the end of each week is as follows:

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since the talent show begins at the end of the fourth week, Josh has 6 balls. However, he drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. 

The correct number of balls Josh has when he starts juggling on stage is 6 - 1 = 5 balls.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, which is 50 pounds. 

Next, we are told that the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

We are also given that the pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. To find the weight of the yellow snake, we add 10 pounds to the weight of the pink frog: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

Furthermore, we know that the pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. To find the weight of the red bird, we subtract 20 pounds from the weight of the pink frog: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of the container, which is given as 20 pounds.

Finally, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits, we must consider the contributions from each source.

First, we have the initial 24 outfits provided by Laurel's friend. Then, at the baby shower, she received twice that amount, which equates to 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. Lastly, her mom gifted her an additional 15 outfits.

To calculate the total, we add these amounts together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

Therefore, the total number of baby outfits is 87."
"To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to first determine the increased daily distance. The original distance is 5000 meters, and the coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters. 

To find 1/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which equals 1000 meters. Therefore, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can start by calculating the price of each box.

Juice Box A is priced at $4. 
Since Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, its price is $4 + $5 = $9.
Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, we can find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2."
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can use the concept of weighted averages. We have two types of tables: those with 4 legs and those with 3 legs.

Let's denote the number of tables with 4 legs as 'x' and the number of tables with 3 legs as 'y'. We are given that x = 40 and y = 50.

The total number of legs can be represented as 4x + 3y. Substituting the given values, we get:

4x + 3y = 4(40) + 3(50)
= 160 + 150
= 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to find 40% of the original price of one shirt and then subtract that from the original price.

First, find 40% of $30:
40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:
$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:
$18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the two products.

The factory sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos at $220 each, generating a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: 10"
"To determine the total amount spent on the dog per year, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure. 

The cost of food is $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Additionally, the monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100. 

The total monthly expenditure is the sum of these costs: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we must calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

The yoga class on Monday lasts 1 hour. The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class, so it lasts 3 hours. The cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is 0.5 hours long. The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, so it is 1.5 hours long. Finally, Peyton dedicates 2 hours to errands on Friday.

Now, let's add the hours together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of pots required. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she requires 30 pots for the daisies, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

The total number of pots required is the sum of the pots needed for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

April initially had 100 plant pots. To find the number of pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots required from the initial amount: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we must consider the total amount she had initially and the expenses incurred. 

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. We know that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. The total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15. 

The equation to find the initial amount 'x' is: 
x - $15 = $36

To solve for 'x', we add $15 to both sides of the equation:
x = $36 + $15
x = $51

However, this is the total amount Andrea had initially. To find the amount she saved, we need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
Amount saved = $51 - $15
Amount saved = $36

Therefore, Andrea saved $36."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity. 

Let's start by calculating the time spent swimming, which is half the time spent boating. Since John spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the activities mentioned so far: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Now, we know that 30% of his total time was spent watching shows. We can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15, where x represents the total time. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs. 

Her earnings from the first job can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (20) by the hourly wage ($10), resulting in 20 * 10 = $200. 

Her earnings from the second job can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (15) by the hourly wage ($5), resulting in 15 * 5 = $75. 

The total earnings from both jobs can be found by adding these amounts together: $200 + $75 = $275. 

Now, we must add her initial savings of $80 to this total: $275 + $80 = $355. 

To find the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he purchased. Six toy cars, each costing $2, will be 6 * $2 = $12. Five teddy bears, each costing $1, will be 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After purchasing the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11. His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since she saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

Therefore, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

The final answer is $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, we can infer that he had $4 initially (twice the amount he spent on gumballs). 

Now, we know that Billy had $4 initially and spent $2 on gumballs, so he must have had $4 - $2 = $2 left. This $2 is his remaining change, which he used to buy candy.

We are given that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We are given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Since we know Carver's age, we can substitute C = 45 into the equation: 
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:
50/2 = S
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we can calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

Let's denote the distance from the first city to the second city as x. The distance from the second city to the third city is given as 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

We can set up an equation to represent the total distance of one trip: x + 100 + 50 = 225.

Solving for x, we get x = 75.

Now that we know the distance from the first city to the second city, we can calculate the total distance of one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

To convert this to a more meaningful measure, we can multiply by 24 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours.

However, since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we can round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The final answer is 0.9."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. This can be calculated by taking the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds).

The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the specified beds:

- 4 chihuahua beds require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
- 3 collie beds require 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the amounts required for the chihuahua and collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the speeds at which John drove to his friend's house and back.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance to his friend's house and the distance back home, plus the detour distance. 

Total distance = Distance to friend's house + Distance back home + Detour distance
Total distance = 200 miles + 240 miles + 10 miles
Total distance = 450 miles

Now, we can calculate the total time taken for the trip by dividing the total distance by the average speed.

Average speed = (Speed to friend's house + Speed back home) / 2
Average speed = (70 mph + 80 mph) / 2
Average speed = 150 mph / 2
Average speed = 75 mph

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 450 miles / 75 mph
Time = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we must first identify the total number of students and the number of absent students. 

The total number of students is given as 96. The number of absent students is comprised of 5 girls and 4 boys. 

To find the number of boys present, we subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of students. 

Number of boys present = Total students - Total absent students
= 96 - (5 + 4)
= 96 - 9
= 87

Therefore, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 87."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boys as 'b' and the number of girls as 'g'. We are given that the number of girls is 6, so g = 6.

We are also told that there are twice as many boys as girls, which can be expressed as b = 2g. Substituting the value of g, we get b = 2(6) = 12.

Now, to find the total number of kids, we add the number of boys and girls: total_kids = b + g = 12 + 6 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can set up an equation. Let x be the points scored on the third test. The sum of the points scored on all three tests must be at least 42. We can write this as:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Combine the constants on the left side of the inequality:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:

x ≥ 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is x. Then, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4x - 5).

We know that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4(4) - 5 = 11
Number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale: 3(4x - 5) = 3(4) - 15 = 3

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers minus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:

50 - 4 - 11 - 3 = 32

Therefore, 32 customers were kicked out for other reasons.

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's say Sara had x points before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's points as 3x.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Let's assume Sara had 4 points before.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4
Erin's points before = 12

The correct answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs:

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add up the costs:
$884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To calculate the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to determine the amount of the original cost that is being discounted. 

The discount is 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the total cost for the DIY hand-painted wallpaper.

$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can break down the sales by day and account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie's practice time on Tuesdays is 1 hour. Her practice time on Thursdays is 2 hours. Since her Saturday practice lasts twice as long as Tuesday's class, it is 2 x 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add up the hours for each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to find the number of functioning pieces and then multiply it by the cost per piece.

Let's break it down:

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

First, we find the number of faulty pieces:
Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000 and 160,000 are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
Number of functioning pieces = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

Now, we can find the cost of functioning pieces:
Cost per piece = Total amount spent / Total number of pieces = $400,000 / 400,000 = $1 per piece

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece = 240,000 * $1 = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the amount of milk from the first half of the sheep. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them is 30 / 2 = 15. 

The amount of milk from the first half of the sheep is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.

Next, we need to find the amount of milk from the second half of the sheep. Again, half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15. 

The amount of milk from the second half of the sheep is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we must consider the initial number of rolls and the subsequent division of the remaining rolls.

We begin with a dozen, which is equivalent to 12 rolls. After feeding 6 rolls to her children, Mrs. Sherman is left with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls.

Next, we divide the remaining 6 rolls into 8 equal pieces each. This can be calculated as 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is 48."
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. So, the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. This allows us to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The total number of apples picked over the three days is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing. The total number of socks that need washing is 50. Hence, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

Next, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total: 65 - 44 = 21.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal (initial amount borrowed) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1.043383) ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = 3650 [ 0.00875 ] / 0.043383
M = 83.00

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $83."
"To determine the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we must first calculate the distance each of them covered.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we can find the difference in distance hiked by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To calculate the profit per hour, we need to first determine the total revenue and total cost. 

Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1 and makes 36 cups in total. Her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve for the original amount of land, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who can perform, we first need to find the total number of female members in the choir. Since 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers will also be performing, so we add them to the number of girls: 26 + 3 = 29.

Half of the people performing can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 29. This can be calculated as 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The sum of the scores is 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400. 

Dividing the sum by the number of tests, we get 400 / 5 = 80. 

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the following steps:

First, we multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we multiply the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil: 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total cost is $36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

The number of messages to Mr. Yu is 1/3 of the number of messages to Ms. Thompson. Since Ms. Thompson received 66 messages, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
= 66 / 3
= 22

Now, we add the number of messages to Mr. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total:

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
= 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, David saves $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we must first calculate the total number of gifts she needs to wrap. This can be found by adding the number of gifts for her family, friends, and teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Next, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift. 

Total amount of ribbon = 144 inches
Total number of gifts = 12

Ribbon per gift = Total amount of ribbon / Total number of gifts
= 144 inches / 12
= 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to determine the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package."
"To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to calculate the total work time first. 

The time spent writing is 4 hours, recording is half of that, which is 2 hours, and editing is 1.5 hours. 

Total work time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total work time and multiplying by 100:

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we can represent the situation using algebra. Let's denote the number of books in each row as 'r'. Since the shelving system has 6 rows, the total capacity can be represented as 6r.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we can represent this as 2(6r) + 20.

To find the value of 'r', we need more information. However, we can express the total capacity as 6r = 6(2r + 20).

Simplifying the equation, we get 6r = 12r + 120.

Subtracting 12r from both sides, we get -6r = 120.

"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we must consider the initial number of cards she made, the number of cards she received from her dad, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices she gave away and subtract that from the initial number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is equivalent to (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save, we can use the following calculation:

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days needed to save: $300 ÷ $10 = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can represent their ages algebraically. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we have:
E = 30

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can express Beth's age as:
B = E + 5
B = 30 + 5
B = 35

Now, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can express Alice's age as:
A = B + 7
A = 35 + 7
A = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica can be found by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age:
Difference = A - E
= 42 - 30
= 12

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To calculate the total calories consumed, we can multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of glasses by the ounces per glass: 2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the total earnings of the builder for a year, we need to multiply the number of working days in a year by the daily wage.

First, we calculate the total number of working days in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the builder works 6 days a week. So, the total number of working days in a year is 52 * 6 = 312 days.

Next, we multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage of $50. This gives us 312 * 50 = $15,600.

Therefore, the builder's total earnings for the year are $15,600.

Final answer: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions.

Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, we can multiply these quantities by 4. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate. 

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). 

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours:
New energy usage per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved per day is 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh.

To convert Wh to kWh, we divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh.

Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting c represent the number of corns and c + 2 represent the number of cannolis. We are given that the total number of cannolis is 40, so we can set up the equation:

c + 2 = 40

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

c = 38

Now, we are told that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. This can be represented by the equation:

c - 40 = 0

However, this equation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, we can set up the equation:

c = 2(c + 40)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

c = 2c + 80

Subtracting 2c from both sides gives us:

-c = 80

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives us:

c = -80

This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we can't have a negative number of corns. Let's re-examine the problem.

"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we must first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

He completed half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To determine the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we can calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, we can find the time he will arrive at the airport by subtracting the time it takes to finish the book from the total time he needs to arrive. 

Time to arrive at the airport = Total time to arrive - Time to finish the book = 60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, Toby will arrive 30 minutes early at the airport.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. The total amount paid in May can be calculated as:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 3/4 of the employees. The number of employees in June is 3/4 * 40 = 30 employees. The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $3 + $1.50 + $1 = $5.50.

"To calculate the total amount spent by Tim, we need to find the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the total cost of the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount amount is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies required for 30 days. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night, the total number of cookies needed is 2 * 30 = 60.

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two events. We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we want to find the probability that this defect also causes the candle to explode.

Let's denote the event of a candle smelling like wet dog as A and the event of a candle exploding as B. We are given P(A) = 0.05, which represents the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog.

However, we are not given the probability of a candle exploding, P(B). To proceed, we need to make an assumption. Since the problem states that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog and are also guaranteed not to explode, we can assume that the 5% is a subset of the candles that explode. This means that P(A ∩ B) = P(A) = 0.05.

Using the formula for conditional probability, we can calculate the probability of a candle exploding given that it smells like wet dog:

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) = 0.05 / 0.05 = 1

This implies that the probability of a candle exploding given that it smells like wet dog is 1, which is not possible. This is a problem, as it indicates that the events A and B are not independent.

However, we can still calculate the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode by multiplying the total number of candles by the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = P(A) x Total number of candles = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500

Therefore, 2,500 candles will both smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 x $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 x $14
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Furthermore, we know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We can express the total number of apples gathered by both sisters as the sum of the apples gathered from each type of tree: T + S + A = 500.

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

Therefore, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, which translates to the equation:

c + d = 180

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304, considering camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. This gives us the equation:

2c + d = 304

To solve for 'c' and 'd', we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of 'c':

2c + 2d = 360

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
d = 56

Now that we have found 'd', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'c':

c + d = 180
c + 56 = 180
c = 124

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the locker sizes. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up an equation: 

Peter's locker size = (1/4) * Zack's locker size
5 cubic inches = (1/4) * Zack's locker size

To find Zack's locker size, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the elevation of Stanley and the distance the comb fell.

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Elevation of Stanley + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Elevation of Oliver
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is 11,000."
"To determine the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the sum of the initial amount he had and the amounts received from the two banks.

The initial capital is $5000. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

To find the total capital, we add the initial capital to the amounts received from the two banks: $5000 + $4000 + $8000.

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried 5 cats each, we can multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Next, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5. To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we can multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (30) and then divide by the denominator (5): (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we can break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8/month * 6 months = $48
2. The next 8 months: $12/month * 8 months = $96
3. The last 8 months: $14/month * 8 months = $112

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown prices. Let's say the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 3. Multiply the first term by 3/3:

x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

Now, distribute the 2/3 to the terms inside the parentheses:

x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

3/3 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3/3 * x = 2

Divide both sides by 3/3 (which is equivalent to 1):

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

First, we'll calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since Lillian bought 3 of them and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. We know that each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since Lillian built 3 of these feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price. 25% of $4 is $1, so the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve for the number of cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling these cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that Kenny has $50 in spending cash, which is the amount he made from selling the cards. So, we can set up the equation:

1 * x = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 1:

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many guests were prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Since 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. 

Half of 6 (the number of letters in Indras' name) is 3. Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, resulting in 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the individual costs: $120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The cost of the skipping rope is $6, the board game is $11, and the playground ball is $2. 

The total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, totaling $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we can calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew as follows:

(3/4) * 100 = 75

Next, we are told that Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, we can calculate the number of dragons Prince Walter slew as:

2 * 75 = 150

Finally, we are informed that Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can calculate:

(1/5) * 150 = 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"To find the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we must first determine the volume of a single container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the volume of one container as follows:

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Now, we need to find 1/4 of the volume of one container. To do this, we can multiply the volume of one container by 1/4:

3 gallons × 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3/4 gallon to pints:

3/4 gallon × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as 'x'. We know that he spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

We also know that he spent 120 cents on chips. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy bars is 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can set up the equation:

75x = 375

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75:

x = 375 / 75
x = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we must first calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Ray kept 5 for himself. This can be done by subtracting the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to find the number of lollipops each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to consider the total weight of the cake and the number of pieces it was cut into. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, we can calculate the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the weight of the two pieces from the total weight.

Let's break it down:

Total weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who had a piece = 2

Since each person had a piece, the weight of the two pieces is equal to 2 ounces (2 pieces / 2 people = 1 ounce per person). 

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of oranges. 

Sitti and Juris initially have 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 additional individuals, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To calculate the cost per serving, we need to first determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine is purchasing 2 pounds of onions, which is twice the amount required by the recipe. Since the recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, we can assume the original amount is indeed 2 pounds. The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we first need to establish the time it takes for each individual to reach the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

The time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 4 times the time it takes Wayne, which is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we must first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has a total of 1 + 2 * 20 = 41 beads.

Margareth purchased 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has a total of 3 + 4 * 20 = 83 beads.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 83 - 41 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the combined effects of the temperature increase due to baking and the subsequent cooling effect.

The house's temperature increases by 5 degrees every hour that the oven is on. Since the oven is on for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

However, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes that the window is open. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 3 intervals of 10 minutes. Therefore, the total cooling effect is 2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, we can calculate the final temperature by adding the initial temperature to the temperature increase and subtracting the cooling effect: 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

First, let's find James' swim time. Since he finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we can calculate it as follows:

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Next, we'll find James' bike time. He takes 5 minutes longer than Jon, who took 80 minutes. So, James' bike time is:

80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, let's denote James' run time as x. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

Therefore, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we first convert the length of Movie C to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we find the length of Movie B by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Finally, we calculate the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To determine the total distance the horse runs, we must convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we must first convert the dozen eggs to a numerical value. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many trays Rozanne can fill with 50 eggs, given that each tray holds 5 glasses and each glass requires 5 eggs. To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 ÷ 5 = 10.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 10 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we must first calculate the points each player has after their respective turns.

Joey initially had 214 points and scored 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy, who started with 225 points, scored 10 points, increasing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score: 240 - 235 = 5.

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Let's denote the number of sneakers sold at $20 as 'x'. We know that the total number of sneakers is 48, so the number of sneakers sold at $25 can be represented as (48 - x).

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from selling sneakers at $20 and the revenue from selling sneakers at $25. This can be expressed as:

Total revenue = 20x + 25(48 - x)

We also know that the total cost is $576. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit can be represented as:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = 20x + 25(48 - x) - 576

To simplify the expression, we can expand and combine like terms:

Profit = 20x + 1200 - 25x - 576
Profit = -5x + 624

Now, we need to find the value of 'x' to determine the profit. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20, we can substitute x = 17 into the expression:

Profit = -5(17) + 624
Profit = -85 + 624
Profit = 539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the total number of colors in the six packets with 8 colors each. This can be done by multiplying the number of packets (6) by the number of colors in each packet (8), which gives us 6 x 8 = 48.

Next, we calculate the total number of colors in the four packets with 16 colors each. This can be done by multiplying the number of packets (4) by the number of colors in each packet (16), which gives us 4 x 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is 112."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the movie ticket as 'x' and the cost of the popcorn as 'y'. We know that the cost of the soda is $3.

We are given two options: buying a super ticket for $20 that includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, or buying a movie ticket for $12 and buying one popcorn and a soda at regular price.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Option 1: Buying a super ticket for $20, which includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. The cost of the movie ticket is $20 - $1 = $19. The cost of the popcorn and soda is $3. So, the equation for this option is: x + y + 3 = 19.
- Option 2: Buying a movie ticket for $12 and buying one popcorn and a soda at regular price. The cost of the popcorn is y, and the cost of the soda is $3. So, the equation for this option is: x + y + 3 = 12.

Since we know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12, we can substitute x = 12 in both equations.

For Option 1: 12 + y + 3 = 19
y = 19 - 12 - 3
y = 4

For Option 2: 12 + y + 3 = 12
y = 12 - 12 - 3
y = -3 (not possible, as cost cannot be negative)

However, we are given that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18. So, we can set up the equation: x + y + 3 = 18.

Substituting x = 12, we get:
12 + y + 3 = 18
y = 18 - 12 - 3
y = 3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the new cost per balloon. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, and the cost per balloon increased by $20. 

Let's calculate the new cost per balloon: $900 / 20 = $45. Then, add the $20 increase: $45 + $20 = $65. 

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 170 x $65 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To calculate the average speed of the car, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The correct answer is: 50"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she has left after the trade. She initially had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires can be calculated by multiplying the number of sapphires by their individual value: 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we calculate the value of the rubies she received. Since she received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200, the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

Since both Marin and Nancy consume 4 apples daily, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples. 

To find the total number of apples eaten over 30 days, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To determine the total volume of soil required, we must first calculate the volume of a single raised bed. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. In this case, the dimensions are 8 feet (length), 2 feet (width), and 2 feet (height). 

Volume = length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we can calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Since the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of cards of each color:

Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 25 more fairies joined from the east, making the total 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. After that, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we must calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, the weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. 

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck, which is 2250 pounds. 

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To calculate Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to determine her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then combine them.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans a week, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. Each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles a week, so her weekly earnings from plastic bottles is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we'll add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find her total monthly earnings, we'll multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to calculate Toni's plants first. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can use the following formula:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60/100) * Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + (60/100) * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total amount Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's $100 and add it to his initial $21.

The final answer is 71."
"To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man as a tip, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

The cost of the pizza is $15. 

1/5 of $15 is calculated as $15 * 1/5 = $3.

To find the total amount Ashley should give, we add the cost of the pizza to the calculated tip amount: $15 + $3 = $18.

Therefore, Ashley should give the delivery man a total of $18."
"To determine Finley's final position, let's analyze her movements step by step:

Finley started in 1st place. She then fell back 5 spots, which means she was in 6th place. Next, she moved ahead 2 spots, placing her in 4th position. After that, she fell behind 3 spots, resulting in a position of 7th. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which means she ended up in 6th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 6th place.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student received.

First, let's calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards in each deck, and 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. 

Total basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards
Total baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards

Total cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Now, we divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples each of them bought and subtract the discount from each total.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. The total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. The total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we can break down the items per room and calculate the total.

Let's denote the number of sheets as S, the number of comforters as C, the number of pillowcases as P, and the number of towels as T. We know that:

- S = 2
- C = 1
- P = 2S
- T = 2P

We can express P and T in terms of S:
- P = 2S = 2(2) = 4
- T = 2P = 2(4) = 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces per room:
S + C + P + T = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of pieces per room by 80:
15 * 80 = 1200

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we must consider the sequence of events:

1. He begins with 200 shoes.
2. He acquires 5 pairs on Monday, increasing his total to 200 + 5 = 205 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, bringing his total to 205 + 15 = 220 shoes.
4. The following Friday, he acquires 30 pairs, resulting in a total of 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.
5. Finally, on Saturday, he disposes of 180 shoes, leaving him with 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 70 shoes on Sunday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the number of pans Mary needs to bake, we must first calculate the total number of cupcakes required. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Next, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold to find the number of pans needed.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the cost of the piece of paper, we can start by calculating three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, we multiply this amount by 3 to get 2 * 3 = $6. 

The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so we subtract $1 from $6 to find the cost of the paper: 6 - 1 = $5.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items by adding the cost of the pen and the cost of the paper: $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Finally, we can find the amount of change Theo received by subtracting the total cost from the $10 she gave the cashier: 10 - 7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the number of pencils left, we need to consider the sequence of events that occurred throughout the year.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we determine the number of pencils used in two months. Since 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can calculate this as (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils. This can be found by multiplying 240 by (1/3), resulting in (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve the equation (1/2)x + 2 = 5, we can start by isolating the term with the variable. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat is 6."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent the total number of students as x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. The remaining students without a desktop computer can be represented as (1/4)x.

We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine the daily walking time, we need to divide the total number of minutes (240) by the number of days Jason can walk (21 days).

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we can also express this as:

11.43 minutes/day × 4 days/week = 45.72 minutes/week

However, the question asks for the daily time, so we'll stick with the first calculation.

The final answer is 11.43."
"To determine the number of books each child received, we must first calculate the total number of books purchased. This can be achieved by dividing the total amount spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since the books were distributed equally among 4 children, we can then divide the total number of books by 4 to find the number each child received.

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B. We're given |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts can be calculated as |D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Since there are 32 kids in the class, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is given by |(D ∪ P)'| = 32 - |D ∪ P| = 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

The number of groups is 3, and each group has 200 employees. Therefore, the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Additionally, there are 7 tour guides accompanying the employees. To find the total number of people going on the tour, we simply add the number of employees and the number of tour guides: 600 + 7 = 607.

The final answer is 607."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we can break down the information into two parts: blue paint and yellow paint.

First, we know that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we can calculate Jasper's blue paint as follows:

4 (Ben's blue paint) / 2 = 2

Next, we know that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we can calculate Jasper's yellow paint as follows:

3 (Ben's yellow paint) * 3 = 9

Now, we can find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has by adding the number of blue and yellow paint:

2 (Jasper's blue paint) + 9 (Jasper's yellow paint) = 11

Therefore, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as x. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can write the equation:

x = (3/4) * 48

To solve for x, we can multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4:

x = (3 * 48) / 4
x = 144 / 4
x = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = weight of 1959 penny + weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we must first calculate the total earnings of Keegan and Tashay. 

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so their combined earnings are $83 + $91 = $174.

The goal is $200, and they have already earned $174. To find the remaining amount needed, we subtract the total earnings from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need $26 more to reach their goal."
"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate 3 times the number of songs Gabriel has. 

3 x 20 = 60

Since Luri already has 60 songs, we need to find out how many more songs he can add. To do this, we subtract the number of songs he has from the maximum capacity of his player.

100 - 60 = 40

Therefore, Luri can add 40 songs to his player.

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to find 2/5 of 60.

We can start by converting the fraction 2/5 to a decimal: 2/5 = 0.4

Now, we multiply 0.4 by 60: 0.4 * 60 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10: 24 * 10 = 240

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can represent the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We are given that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are also given that her shoes cost $80. We can substitute s = 80 into the equation:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs per week, we can multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week and then divide by his speed.

First, we multiply the number of miles per day by the number of days per week: 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Next, we divide the total miles per week by James' speed: 60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, James runs 6 hours per week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of oats by his horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to convert the total amount of oats from pounds to bags. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats by 50: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can calculate the fraction of the total number of puppies that are Pomeranians and then apply the fraction of those that are girls.

First, we find the number of Pomeranians: 2/3 of 27 puppies = (2/3) * 27 = 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we calculate the number of girl Pomeranians: 1/3 of 18 Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18 = 6 girl Pomeranians.

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, we divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is -10."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we can use the following calculation:

Remaining amount = Total cost of the toy - Amount he already has
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount to find the number of days:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, the child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray, we can use simple subtraction. 

We know that Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs.

Total capacity of trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Number of eggs that won't be placed = Total number of eggs - Total capacity of trays
= 64 - 48
= 16

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors.

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. 

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, with an average height of 64 inches. The total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we need to calculate the total minutes she walks per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since Charisma works 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

She walks for 5 minutes every hour, so she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes per day.

To find the total minutes walked in 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes walked by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can write the equation:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38.

The final answer is 38."
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we can break down the problem into two parts: morning rides and afternoon rides.

First, we calculate the total number of rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides.

Next, we calculate the cost of the morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168.

Then, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56.

Finally, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together: $168 + $56 = $224.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"To determine the total number of oranges, we must first calculate the number of oranges each individual brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, resulting in 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is the sum of the oranges Ashley and Brianne brought, which is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest), which can be expressed as 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest), which is already inclusive of food.

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of insects each person found using variables. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David's total is x/2. Lily found 7 more than David, so her total is x/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily's total = x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 91 yards (1/4 * 364 = 91). Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 182 yards (1/2 * 364 = 182).

The total yards used is the sum of these two amounts: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be represented as 2 x 5, which equals 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be represented as 3 x 2, which equals 6 gifts.

Now, we add the gifts from both groups together: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 additional random gifts to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To find the length of the couch, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the width of the rug as 'w' and the length of the couch as 'l'. We know that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we can express the width of the rug as w = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

We are also given that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. This can be expressed as l = 2w + 2. Substituting the value of w, we get l = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, the total spent on these two types of gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Given that Suzie paid a total of $7, the amount spent on strawberry gum can be found by subtracting the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie purchased 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack can be determined by dividing the total spent on strawberry gum by 2: $4 ÷ 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option. We can calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, we can conclude that buying 2 x 8 lumber is the most cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

The most cost-effective option is to buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber, allowing Frederick to make 1600 popsicle sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

The calculation is as follows:

6 (number of dogs) × $12.00 (cost per pair of snowshoes) = $72.00

Therefore, the total cost of snowshoes for all of Mario's dogs is $72.00."
"To determine the weekly savings of Janet by purchasing a bus pass, we must first calculate the total weekly cost of her bus trips. 

Since Janet takes two bus trips per day, 5 days a week, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10. 

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, her weekly savings would be $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to analyze the given information.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. This means the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as x and the number of potatoes she bought as y.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve this goal.

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories per pound. To lose 30 pounds, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his goal."
"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we must first calculate his total earnings for the week. Since he earns $30 per day, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

$30 per day × 7 days = $210

Next, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find his remaining balance:

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance can be found by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we know that Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer. To find the total amount of water she needs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water needed per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 * 60
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is equivalent to 0.20 * $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, we calculate the amount she spent on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining $400. This is equivalent to 0.25 * $400 = $100.

Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the cost of the house as 'h' and the cost of the lot as 'l'. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can set up the equation:

h = 3l

We also know that the total cost is $120,000, which is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot:

h + l = 120,000

Now, we can substitute the expression for h from the first equation into the second equation:

3l + l = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4l = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

l = 30,000

Now that we have found the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting the value of l into the first equation:

h = 3l
h = 3(30,000)
h = 90,000

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara, we need to consider the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost of the bags can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 8 packs * $4 per pack = $32.

The total revenue is obtained by multiplying the number of bags by the selling price per bag: 8 bags * $8 per bag = $64.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit: $64 - $32 = $32.

Therefore, the profit earned by Tara is $32."
"To calculate the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to multiply the number of punches he throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight.

The number of punches per minute is 25, and the total number of minutes in the fight is 3 rounds * 5 minutes per round = 15 minutes.

The total number of punches can be calculated as follows:

25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of cookies made by each individual. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we are told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find Kelsie's cookies, we can multiply Josh's cookies by 2:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

To find the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner, we need to calculate 3/5 of the remaining amount of money. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as 'r' and the time it takes Royce as 'R'. We are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. This can be expressed as:

R = 2r + 40

We are also given that Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. So, we can substitute r = 120 into the equation:

R = 2(120) + 40
R = 240 + 40
R = 280

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we must calculate the total number of items for the triplets and multiply the number of skeins required for each item.

First, we calculate the total number of items for the triplets:
- Hats: 3 grandchildren * 1 hat = 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 grandchildren * 1 scarf = 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 grandchildren * 1 sweater = 3 sweaters
- Pairs of mittens: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair = 3 pairs

To find the total number of skeins needed, we add the number of skeins required for each item:
6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63

Therefore, Martha will need 63 skeins of wool."
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we know Chris completes 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. The total problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Next, we need to find the remaining problems. Since Chris has 100 problems in total, we subtract the problems completed so far: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

Now, we know Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems on Wednesday. To find one-quarter of 52, we can divide 52 by 4, which equals 13 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

The final answer is 39."
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we must consider the total number of loaves initially baked, the number sold, and the number returned.

The bakery started with 200 loaves. They sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. However, 6 loaves were returned. To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the total sold from the initial amount and then add the returned loaves: 200 - 132 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the bakery has 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the smallest number of rows, which is 3 rows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

The total number of raisins is 27 cups, and each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins. To divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can first find the total number of portions by adding 1 to the denominator of the fraction representing the raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies.

3/4 + 1 = 7/4

Now, we can divide the total number of raisins by the total number of portions:

27 ÷ (7/4) = 27 * 4/7
= 108/7
= 15.43 (approximately)

Since we cannot make a fraction of a batch, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Heather can make 15 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her original and new weekly consumption.

The original daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find the original weekly consumption, we multiply this value by 7 days: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. 

Since a kilowatt per hour is equivalent to $1.50, we can calculate the original weekly bill by multiplying the original weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

The new daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. To find the new weekly consumption, we multiply this value by 7 days: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours. 

We can then calculate the new weekly bill by multiplying the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio of work to time. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as x days. The proportion can be set up as follows:

1 person : 5 days = 1 house : 0.5 house

Since we want to find the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house, we can multiply both sides of the proportion by 2:

1 person : 10 days = 1 house : 1 house

Now, we can see that it takes one person 10 days to paint a whole house. To find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can divide the time it takes for one person by 5:

10 days ÷ 5 = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, we can set up the equation:

Number of sofas = Number of chairs - 2
20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
Jenna's chairs = 3x
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of CDs as 'x'. The total cost of the CDs and the headphone set can be represented as 4x + 44.

We know that the total amount paid was $48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4x + 44 = 48

To solve for 'x', we can subtract 44 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 48 - 44
4x = 4

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 4/4
x = 1

This means Tom could have bought 1 additional CD if he had not bought the headphone set.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, let's consider the weeks he worked 4 hours. Since we don't know the exact number of weeks he worked 4 hours, we'll represent it as 'x'. We know that he worked 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, so the total hours for those weeks is 5 * 2 = 10 hours. Additionally, he worked 6 hours in one week.

The total number of hours can be represented as 4x + 10 + 6. Since we're considering 8 weeks, we can set up an equation: 4x + 10 + 6 = 8x.

Now, let's solve for x: 
4x + 16 = 8x
16 = 4x
x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of hours: 
4x + 10 + 6 = 4(4) + 10 + 6
= 16 + 10 + 6
= 32

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 32 hours."
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers now is 59 + 63 = 122.

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 122."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Jame's current age be x. In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

We are given that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This can be expressed as the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote the cost of one monitor as 'x'. We know that the cost of the computer is $1,100, and the total cost of all three items is $2,400.

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer can be expressed as $1,100 - $400 = $700.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total cost:

$1,100 (computer) + $x (monitor) + $700 (printer) = $2,400

Combine like terms:

$1,800 + $x = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:

$x = $600

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $600."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the girls. Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, each girl brought 30 seashells."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's represent the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Nick's initial amount:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially."
"To determine Anne's age, we must first calculate Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can find Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from 10, which yields 6 years.

Next, we must add 2 to Alyana's age to determine Anne's age. Therefore, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can calculate the difference between the total number of vlogs she wants to make and the number of vlogs she has already made.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is 18."
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to find 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 can be calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Initially, we know that $18 is shared among 3 boys. To find out how much each boy gets, we divide the total amount by the number of boys: $18 ÷ 3 = $6 per boy.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Now, he triples the amount he had left after spending $8, which is 3 times $13, equaling $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since there are 15 days in the first half of April, the total amount saved in the first half is 15x.

In the second half of the month, Elvis wants to save twice as much, so he saves 2x dollars per day. Since there are also 15 days in the second half, the total amount saved in the second half is 15(2x).

We know that the total amount saved in the first half is equal to the total amount saved in the second half, so we can set up the equation:

15x = 15(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15x = 30x

Subtracting 15x from both sides gives us:

0 = 15x

Dividing both sides by 15 gives us:

0 = x

However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Elvis can't save $0 per day. Let's re-examine the equation.

The correct equation should be:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the amount Elvis needs to save per day in the second half of the month:

2x = 2(25) = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruit. 

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. 
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. 
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruit is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's represent the amount of money Brad receives as 'x'. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, which is $100, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To isolate the variable x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the amount of money Jeff receives. Since Jeff's share is 4x, we multiply x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4 * 20
Jeff's share = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80."
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we must first calculate the daily round-trip distance. 

The distance from his home to work is 3 miles. Since he walks to and from work, the daily round-trip distance is 2 times the one-way distance, which equals 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily round-trip distance by the number of days he works in a week, which is 5. 

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into three distinct steps.

First, we calculate the number of letters written in the first instance of writing the alphabet in full. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, and she writes it twice, the total number of letters written in this step is 26 * 2 = 52.

Next, we consider the number of letters written in the second step, which is half of the alphabet. Half of 26 letters is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Lastly, we add the number of letters written in the first two steps to the number of letters written in the third step, which is the re-write of everything she has already written. This results in 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"This problem can be solved using the concept of a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant. In this case, the constant is 3.

The number of families notified in each round can be represented as a geometric sequence: 3, 9, 27, 81, ...

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: an = ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, a = 3 and r = 3. We want to find the fourth term, so n = 4.

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. We know that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. 

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. The total weight lost can be calculated by multiplying the weight lost per month (10 pounds) by the number of months (3). This gives us 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can set up the equation: x - 30 = 70.

To solve for 'x', we add 30 to both sides of the equation, resulting in x = 100.

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. We know that he needs 2 more toys to have a play set five times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys. 

We can set up the equation: x + 2 = 5 * 80

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 400

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is 398."
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first find the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
Next, we calculate the cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
Then, we calculate the cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Now, we add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, Carly gets $17 back as change."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for sales up to $1000. To find 30% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.3.

$1000 * 0.3 = $300

Next, we calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000. The amount over $1000 is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). To find 10% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.1.

$1500 * 0.1 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings.

$300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles he already possesses. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, we can calculate this as 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles for each guest, so we can calculate this as 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles needed, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and then subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day.

First, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know that he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day:
2 x 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

Next, we find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day:
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we must first calculate his weekly earnings. 

Weekly earnings can be calculated by multiplying the hourly wage ($2) by the number of hours worked per day (5) and then by the number of days worked per week (4). 

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we divide the amount John wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find the number of weeks it will take him to save $80.

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we can multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub, which is 3 * $40 = $120.

Therefore, the total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160."
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes. Since there are 7 such buttons, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes. There are 14 such buttons (21 total buttons minus the 7 with two holes), and each has 4 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we must first establish the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker. Since Timothy's locker measures 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing 24 by 2.

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker measures 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups. 

Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current intake is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

We have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30. 

Additionally, we have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45.

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we must first determine their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of right-angled triangles. Let's consider the initial position of the sun at the tip of the pyramid, forming a right-angled triangle with the ground and the line connecting the sun to the point directly below it on the ground.

The angle between the ground and the line connecting the sun to the point directly below it on the ground is 32 degrees. The sun's movement is perpendicular to this line, so we can consider it as the height of the triangle. 

Since the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees upward. 

Now, we can use the tangent function to find the new angle: tan(θ) = opposite side (50 degrees) / adjacent side (32 degrees). 

θ = arctan(50/32) ≈ 58.99 degrees.

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is approximately 58.99 degrees.

The final answer is: 59"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required. 

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Since James has two sons, he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, making a total of 4 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by 5.

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we first need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week. Since she reads 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can calculate the total minutes she read in the first week as 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total minutes to pages. Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total minutes by 1.5 and multiplying by 2. 

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

Now, we can add the pages read in the first week (70 pages) to the pages read in the second week (100 pages) to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks: 
70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 4 sandwiches (since 1/3 of 12 is 4). Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 3 sandwiches (since 1/4 of 12 is 3).

The total number of sandwiches eaten is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial total. 

12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Shiloh's current age be S and his nephew's current age be N. We are given that S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3N + 21

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

The tooth fairy initially left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals: R = 80

We can substitute R = 80 into the first equation to find Mark's goals:
80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now, we can substitute R = 80 into the second equation to find Anna's goals:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we must first calculate the total amount Mitchell made from selling lemonades. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price of each lemonade.

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4 = $84

Now, we need to find the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam. To do this, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Difference = $84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to break down his spending into two parts: the wooden action figures and the plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures. Since Peter spent $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, we can multiply the daily expenditure by the number of days:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, we subtract this amount from Peter's initial $70 to find out how much he has left:

$70 - $15 = $55

This remaining amount will be used to buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. To find out how many plastic action figures Peter can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each figure:

$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since Peter cannot buy a fraction of a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total:

3 (wooden) + 27 (plastic) = 30

Therefore, Peter will have a total of 30 action figures by the end of the week.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied in a month: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to determine the total amount she removes from the account in 24 months.

Since she removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months to find the total amount removed:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich. In this case, the food truck sold 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $70.00.

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and since one loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00. Additionally, the cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for every 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we must first calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Next, we divide the total number of crayons by 8, as each muffin requires 8 crayons.

192 ÷ 8 = 24

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the padding, and the installation.

First, we calculate the area of the room: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days and then divide by 7.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To find the final value of the number train, we can break down the problem into steps:

Let's denote the starting value as x. The problem states that the starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, and the resulting value was then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

The expression for this can be written as: ((x + x/2) / 5) * (x - 12)

To simplify this expression, we can start by evaluating the terms inside the parentheses:

(x + x/2) = (2x/2 + x/2) = (3x/2)

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: ((3x/2) / 5) * (x - 12)

Next, we can simplify the fraction: (3x/2) / 5 = (3x/10)

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: (3x/10) * (x - 12)

To multiply these two expressions, we can use the distributive property: (3x/10) * (x - 12) = (3x^2 - 36x)/10

Since we know the starting value is 20, we can substitute x = 20 into the expression: (3(20)^2 - 36(20))/10

Evaluating the expression, we get: (1200 - 720)/10 = 480/10 = 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 18 degrees off from the set temperature. To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of the target temperature. We can set up a proportion to find the correct temperature: 

(4/100) = (x/520)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 
4 * 520 = 100 * x
2080 = 100x
x = 2080 / 100
x = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 20.8 degrees above the target temperature.

Final answer: 20.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3.

$76,000 x 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

To find the combined value of both houses, we add their individual values.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the discounted price of 2 boxes. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 

First, we calculate 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00. Subtracting this from the original price, we get a discounted price of $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we must first calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His hourly wage is also $10, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

The total calories burned from aerobics and running can be calculated as follows:

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over 5 weeks.

Let's consider the weight change per week for each option:

- Option 1: Losing 1.25 pounds/week
- Option 2: Gaining 1.75 pounds/week

We can find the total weight change over 5 weeks by multiplying the weight change per week by the number of weeks:

Total weight change for Option 1 = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
Total weight change for Option 2 = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the difference between the total weight changes:

Difference in weight = |8.75 - 6.25| = 2.5 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can use a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of people invited by Alex. She initially invites 100 people. Then, each of these 100 people invites 2 of their friends, resulting in an additional 200 people. 

However, we also need to account for the 10 friends that Alex directly invited, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 18 more people to the total count.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people attending the event by adding the initial number of people invited, the number of friends invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

Total number of people = 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses)

Total number of people = 100 + 200 + 18
Total number of people = 318

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can break down the information step by step.

First, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which means the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"The problem at hand involves an exponential growth pattern, where the height of the beanstalk doubles every day. We can model this growth using the formula for exponential growth: 

H(t) = H0 * 2^t

where H(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t, H0 is the initial height (4 feet), and t is the number of days.

We want to find the smallest value of t such that H(t) > 20 feet (the height of Mark's window).

To solve for t, we can set up the inequality:

4 * 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.32

Since t must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest value of t that satisfies the inequality is t = 3.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the total amount of protein John receives per week, we must first calculate the daily intake. We know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily, and each cup weighs 100 grams. 

Dividing the daily consumption by the weight of a single cup yields: 
200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Since each cup contains 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup: 
2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find the weekly intake, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 
6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to represent Jerry's age. Let's denote Jerry's current age as x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

Now that we know Jerry's current age is 10, we can find his age in 3 years by adding 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the smallest angle be x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we are asked to find the largest angle, the answer is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we must first calculate the total amount of money he possesses. 

He has 8 quarters, which is equivalent to 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we must consider the number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2 legs.

We can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of pet by its respective number of legs and then adding the results together.

For dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs = 20 legs
For cats: 2 cats * 4 legs = 8 legs
For birds: 10 birds * 2 legs = 20 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we first calculate 50% of the original weight. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Then, we add this value to the original weight to find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%. 

8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Finally, we subtract 2 pounds from this value to find the weight Jamaal now uses.

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into three parts: the number of games he receives as gifts and the number of games he purchases each year.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This gives us a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve receives another 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This gives us a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month. This gives us a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games. He also receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can add the number of games from each year: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can utilize the concept of rates and proportions. 

First, we establish the rate at which the plane travels. This can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles. We can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown time.

(400 miles/hour) / (3 hours) = (x hours) / (2000 miles)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

400x = 2000 * 3
400x = 6000
x = 6000 / 400
x = 15

Therefore, it would take the plane 15 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we can calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

The final answer is $12."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. We can calculate his earnings for this period by multiplying the number of cups sold per hour by the price per cup and then multiplying by the number of hours.

Let's use the formula: (Number of cups per hour * Price per cup) * Number of hours
= (15 * $0.50) * 4
= $7.50 * 4
= $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. We can calculate his earnings for this period by multiplying the number of cups sold per hour by the price per cup and then multiplying by the number of hours.

Let's use the formula: (Number of cups per hour * Price per cup) * Number of hours
= (10 * $0.60) * 2
= $6 * 2
= $12

Now, we can find the total earnings by adding the earnings from both periods.

Total earnings = $30 + $12
= $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years a tire will last, we must first calculate the total number of rotations it can undergo. Given that each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times and it rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the total miles driven per rotation as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles/rotation = 362.5 miles/rotation

Now, we can multiply the total miles driven per rotation by the number of rotations the tire can undergo to find the total miles driven:

362.5 miles/rotation * 10,440,000 rotations = 3,800,200,000 miles

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can find the total miles driven per year by multiplying the miles driven per month by 12:

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4,800 miles/year

Now, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles driven per year to find the total number of rotations per year:

3,800,200,000 miles / 4,800 miles/year = 792,708.33 rotations/year

Finally, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 792,708.33 rotations/year = 13.19 years

The tire will last approximately 13.19 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 13.19"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we must first establish the total number of washings Jackie will receive from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps yield 120 washings, 1 pump will yield 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Next, we calculate the cost of 60 washings. The total cost for 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Converting the cost from dollars to cents, we have $12.00 = 1200 cents.

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we first need to find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the shirt's original price. 

Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), the sales tax is:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial $50:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he will be short $6.70 after the purchase.

The final answer is $-6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we must first calculate the daily butter requirement. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

Next, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Lewis' and Monica's streets, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost per meter is $194, and Monica's street is 150 meters long. To find the cost of repaving her street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of her street:

Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost for Monica's street = $29,100

Lewis' street is 490 meters long. To find the cost of repaving his street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street:

Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost for Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two streets:

Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000.

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000.

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to multiply the average number of posts per day by the number of days in the month.

The average number of posts per day is 3, and March has 31 days. 

Total number of posts in March = Average number of posts per day * Number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we need to consider the frequency of laundry and the amount of water used per load. Gary does laundry twice a week, resulting in 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads per year. Each load uses 20 gallons of water.

The total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons. Given that a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year can be calculated as 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is $312."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Scarlett, we need to consider the costs of each item she purchased.

The aquarium costs $10.00. Two bags of rocks, priced at $2.50 each, amount to 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Three pieces of coral, priced at $2.00 each, amount to 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. Additionally, Scarlett bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, resulting in 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Lastly, she spent $2.00 on fish food.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

The total amount spent by Scarlett is $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can break down the growth pattern as follows:

The beanstalk starts at 3 inches and doubles in height each week. In the first week, it reaches 3 inches. In the second week, it doubles to 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the third week, it grows an additional 4 inches, resulting in a total height of 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day. 

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg per day = 5 days

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights. Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 6 = 24.

However, 20 of these street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 24 - 20 = 4.

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 4."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played and subtract that from the total capacity of each DVD.

Let's calculate the remaining capacity of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865

Now, we add the remaining capacities of both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to multiply the number of hours attended by the cost per hour. 

Since John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions. Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours. The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 + 2 = 6.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left after chewing 6 pieces. He starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives away, we divide the remaining gum by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

To determine the number of pieces Jim has left, we subtract the number of pieces he gives away from the remaining gum: 14 - 7 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now, to find her age 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the difference in spending between the two coaches, we must first calculate the total amount spent by each.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach acquired 8 basketballs at $14 each, leading to a total expenditure of 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference in spending, we subtract the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers in the garden. 

First, we find the total number of flowers by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Next, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5 to find the number of bloomed flowers:
200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per hour, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert kb to Mb: 1 Mb = 1000 kb, so divide the given speed by 1000.
2. Convert the result to Mb per second: 20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second
3. Convert Mb per second to Mb per hour: multiply by 3600 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour)
0.02 Mb/second × 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

Let's start by calculating the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days to get the total:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Since there are 4 remaining days, we can multiply this rate by the number of days to get the total:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we must first convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the required height is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Next, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Now, we divide the difference by Adam's annual growth rate of 2 inches/year: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and he sold 10 cars. So, the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the total cost minus the amount paid by the company, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown prices. Let's denote the price of the diamond as D, the price of the gold as G, and the price of the silver as S.

We are given that the price of a diamond is $2000, so D = $2000.

We also know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond. This can be expressed as:

G = (4/5)D

Substituting the value of D, we get:

G = (4/5)($2000)
G = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can express this as:

S = G - $400

Substituting the value of G, we get:

S = $1600 - $400
S = $1200

Now, we can find the total price by adding the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of snowflake stamps as S, truck stamps as T, and rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16 (given information).

We also know that T = S + 3 (he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps).

Substituting S = 16 into the equation T = S + 3, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Additionally, we know that R = T - 9 (he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps).

Substituting T = 19 into the equation R = T - 9, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp together: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up an equation based on the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up as 't' hours.

Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, the distance Tom needs to cover to catch up is 75 miles. Tom's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 70 miles per hour. The relative speed between them is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The equation to represent the situation is:

55t = 75

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides by 55:

t = 75 / 55
t = 7/11 hours

To convert this to a more conventional time format, we can multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

t = (7/11) * 60
t = 420/11 hours
t ≈ 38.18 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 38.18 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 38.18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of fish each person caught. We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as C and the maximum cost per class as M. We know that C = $60 and M = $10. We can find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:

C / M = 60 / 10 = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for:

Maximum number of classes he can miss = Maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for - Number of classes he has already signed up for
= 6 - 10
= -4

However, since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the situation:

If Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, it means they are willing to pay for 6 classes at $10 per class, which totals $60. This leaves $0 remaining for additional classes. Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he has already exceeded the budget. Therefore, the correct answer is that he can miss all 10 classes, as his parents won't sign him up again after the initial 10 classes.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the total weekly production, we can start by determining the daily production of each individual. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5(4) = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To solve for L, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, we'll find the cost of 5 apples. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can multiply this by 1.25 (5/4) to get the cost of 5 apples: $5.20 * 1.25 = $6.50.

Next, we'll find the cost of 5 oranges. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can multiply this by 1.67 (5/3) to get the cost of 5 oranges: $3.30 * 1.67 = $5.55.

Now, we'll add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together: $6.50 + $5.55 = $12.05.

The final answer is: $12.05"
"To calculate the volume of the hole, we must multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to consider the individual costs of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and the bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $20,000. To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05.

$20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current salary to find his new monthly salary.

$20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12.

$31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits can be found by multiplying the number of suits (10) by the cost per suit ($750), which equals $7500. 

The cost of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, 1/5 of that amount is $750 * (1/5) = $150. Multiplying this by the number of pants (10) gives us 10 * $150 = $1500.

The cost of dress shirts is $60 each, and there are 10 shirts, so the total cost is 10 * $60 = $600.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7500 + $1500 + $600 = $9600.

The total cost of everything is $9600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites, we need to multiply the number of articles published per day by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 * 28 = 560.

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 * 28 = 280.

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840.

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information step by step:

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as Sn, and his son's wife's age as Sw.

Given:
1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. Sn = W / 2
4. Sw = Sn - 3

We can substitute the values to find the age of Steve's son's wife:

S = 60
W = 60 + 4 = 64
Sn = 64 / 2 = 32
Sw = 32 - 3 = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we must first calculate the amount of flour in one bag. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount in one bag by 3.

16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can calculate their individual distances and then add them together.

Alisa's distance can be calculated by multiplying her speed (12 miles per hour) by the time she biked (4.5 hours):
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley's distance can be calculated by multiplying his speed (10 miles per hour) by the time he biked (2.5 hours):
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add their distances together to find the total:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Since Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, we can divide the total distance of soil (24 feet) by his rate (4 feet/hour):

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Since Bill can dig half that fast through clay, his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. We can then divide the total distance of clay (8 feet) by his rate (2 feet/hour):

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes required, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups: Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

First, we'll calculate the number of cupcakes for each group. Since Howie wants to have 2 cupcakes for himself, his teacher will also receive 2 cupcakes. The remaining 25 classmates will receive 2 cupcakes each.

The total number of cupcakes for the classmates can be calculated by multiplying the number of classmates (25) by the number of cupcakes each will receive (2). This gives us 25 x 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we'll add the number of cupcakes for Howie (2), his teacher (2), and the total number of cupcakes for the classmates (50). The total number of cupcakes required is 2 + 2 + 50 = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can write the equation:

x + 20000 = 70x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:

20000 = 70x - x
20000 = 69x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 69 to find the value of x:

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.52

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll keep the exact value for accuracy.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes:

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 288.52 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.52

The final answer is 20128.52."
"To calculate the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to consider the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, with a $2 discount. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = (20 * $20) - $2
Total cost = $400 - $2
Total cost = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, with a 10% discount. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Original price = 20 * $30
Original price = $600

Discount = 10% of $600
Discount = $600 * 0.10
Discount = $60

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $600 - $60
Final price = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

However, since we are looking for the difference, we can express this as a positive value by taking the absolute value of the difference:

$142"
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, let's denote the amount earned from selling green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats in the first month were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can express this as:

Red = 1/2G
Red = $400

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
G = 2 x $400
G = $800

The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats:
Total = Red + G
Total = $400 + $800
Total = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Second month sales = 3/4 x Total
Second month sales = 3/4 x $1200
Second month sales = $900

The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales from both months:
Total sales = Total + Second month sales
Total sales = $1200 + $900
Total sales = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

The carriage was hired from 5 PM to 9 PM, a total of 4 hours. However, James receives 1 hour of free time, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her weekly wage and her current bank account balance.

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

Subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage: $300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This implies that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will consume.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the total number of eggs required by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

Total dozens needed: 24 / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the remaining fraction by subtracting 1/3 from 1 (the whole). To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 3 in this case. 

1 can be written as 3/3. 

Now, subtract 1/3 from 3/3:
3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3

To find the number of pages, multiply the fraction by the total number of pages:
(2/3) * 15 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can use the following calculation:

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price and the first year's costs: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, the cooking time for pork as P, and the cooking time for beans as B. We are given the following information:

1. R = 30 minutes
2. P = R + 20
3. B = (P + R) / 2

We can substitute the value of R into the equation for P:
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 minutes

Now, we can substitute the values of R and P into the equation for B:
B = (50 + 30) / 2
B = 80 / 2
B = 40 minutes

To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for all three items:
Total time = R + P + B
Total time = 30 + 50 + 40
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 2 and 3, which is 6. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = (1/2) * (3/3) * $10 = (3/6) * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * (2/2) * $15 = (2/6) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 5 and 3, which is 15. 

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = (1/5) * (3/3) * $10 = (3/15) * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * (5/5) * $15 = (5/15) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.
The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can find 'g' by substituting 's' into the equation g = 20 - s:
g = 20 - 15
g = 5

Therefore, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, which costs $5 per pound. 

To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.20, which equals $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's use A to represent the amount of money Aurelia has, K to represent the amount of money Kassidy has, and R to represent the amount of money Rayna has.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120.

We are also given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so K = (3/4)A = (3/4)(120) = 90.

Additionally, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so R = K + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150.

Now, we can find the total amount of money by adding the individual amounts: Total = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

To find the amount each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we must first calculate the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the month is:
12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve for the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating each dog requires one toy. This means he has 4 toys.

Next, 8 more dogs are added to the shelter, increasing the total number of dogs to 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys in total.

However, upon returning, the number of dogs has doubled to 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Nevertheless, 3 dogs are no longer present, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

As each dog requires one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the amount Skyler invested, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the amount Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows:

2/5 of 1200 = (2/5) * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
1200 - 480 = 720

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We can calculate this as:
(2/3) * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:
720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can start by finding the total number of signatures they have already collected. 

Let's add the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer have: 20 (Carol) + 44 (Jennifer) = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we can subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we must first establish her hourly wage. Since Karen's hourly wage is twice that of Lorie's, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 x $10 = $20.

With a daily work schedule of 3 hours, Karen's daily earnings can be calculated as $20 x 3 = $60.

To find her earnings over a two-day period, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can use the concept of ratios. We know that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns. This gives us a ratio of 6:36 or 1:6.

To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"To determine the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 individuals. 

First, we multiply the weight of one adult by 9: 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg.

Next, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight: 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cookies each person has with variables. Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as K, Max has as M, the Cookie Monster has as C, and Summer has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can use these equations to find the values of M, C, and S.

From equation (1), we can express M in terms of K:
M = K + 5

Substituting this expression for M into equation (2), we get:
C + 12 = K + 5
C = K - 7

Now, we can substitute the expression for M into equation (3):
S = (K + 5) + 23
S = K + 28

We are given that K = 68. We can substitute this value into the expressions for M and S:
M = 68 + 5
M = 73
S = 68 + 28
S = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the values of K, M, C, and S:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + (68 - 7) + 96
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can calculate the total time by adding the time taken for both modes. 

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent walking to the corner and the fire station: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total time spent walking from the total time available: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the weight of each item by its respective price per kilogram and then add the results together.

For apples, the cost is 1 kilo * $4/kilo = $4.
For bananas, the cost is 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.
For oranges, the cost is 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

The total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies baked, we must first calculate the number of cookies baked by Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten by the pair, which is 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the age of the younger triplet be x. Since there is one twin who is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet ages, as the question does not specify otherwise. 

The age of the younger triplet is 7 years old, the age of the older triplet is 14 years old, and the age of the older twin is 21 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount of time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time he has before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John has allocated for his homework. This consists of 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history, totaling 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the time John has available for a nap: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break it down into two separate calculations.

First, we'll find the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we can multiply this by 10 to get the total cost:
10 * $0.40 = $4.00

Next, we'll find the cost of 10 candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so we can find the cost of one candy by dividing $3.20 by 4:
$3.20 ÷ 4 = $0.80

Now, we can multiply the cost of one candy by 10 to get the total cost of 10 candies:
10 * $0.80 = $8.00

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 5. We can rewrite 20 as 100/5. 
So, Neil saves 28 + (2/5 * 20) = 28 + 8 = 36/5 coins per month.

Now, we can add their monthly savings: 
(100/5) + (36/5) = 136/5 coins per month.

To find the total coins Rong and Neil save in a year, we multiply their monthly savings by 12:
(136/5) * 12 = (136 * 12) / 5 = 1632 / 5 = 326.4 coins per year.

To find the total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10:
326.4 * 10 = 3264 coins.

Final answer: 3264"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To determine the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total number of squares, we can start by establishing the number of each color. We know that the comforter has 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18. Furthermore, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24. Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, making the number of white squares 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of squares by adding the number of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet."
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the total number of chairs required. 

There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Since the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of high chairs, adults, and babies:

Total number of chairs needed = 8 (high chairs) + 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 65

To find the number of chairs Mia needs to acquire, we subtract the number of chairs already available from the total number of chairs needed:

Number of chairs Mia needs to get = 65 - 8 = 57

Therefore, Mia needs to acquire 57 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we can use the concept of percentages. We know that 20% of the total number of bucks are 8-point bucks. 

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we can find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"The problem at hand involves a classic example of exponential growth. We are dealing with a situation where a set of individuals (in this case, Great Grandma Jones' children) each produce a certain number of offspring, and this process is repeated. This is a quintessential illustration of exponential growth.

To calculate the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ the concept of exponentiation. Specifically, we can use the formula for exponential growth: a^n, where 'a' represents the base (in this case, the number of children per individual) and 'n' represents the number of generations.

In this scenario, we have 3 children per individual, and we want to find the total number of great grand-babies after 3 generations. This can be represented as 3^3.

3^3 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

**Answer: 27**"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she sets aside for retirement and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 x $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 x $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she sets aside for retirement and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

$720"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the total number of pencils present. Since there are 20 spaces available and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, the correct answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can find the total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

15 boxes × 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Next, we need to find 40% of the total fireworks in the city. To do this, we'll multiply the total number of fireworks by 0.4:

300 fireworks × 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we can find the total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:

3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard:

120 fireworks (city) + 15 fireworks (backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total. Each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as x. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck capacity can be represented as x + 800.

When Gary joins, the total capacity becomes 11,600 pounds. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + (x + 800) + y = 11,600

where y represents the capacity of Gary's truck.

Combine like terms:

2x + 800 + y = 11,600

Subtract 800 from both sides:

2x + y = 11,800

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel, so x = 4,000. Substitute this value into the equation:

2(4,000) + y = 11,800

Expand and simplify:

8,000 + y = 11,800

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

y = 3,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 3,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the number of dumplings each male and female ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of money Gerald had left, we need to first determine his initial share of the $100. Since the ratio of Gerald's share to Julia's share is 3:2, we can calculate his share as follows:

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. Gerald's share is 3 parts, so his initial amount is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Next, we subtract the amount Gerald spent ($10) from his initial amount to find the amount he has left: 60 - 10 = 50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we divide the speed of the cat by 5, as the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find the remaining amount they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked (3 hours) to find the hourly amount.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we must first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 2 weeks by 7 days to obtain 14 days.

Next, we multiply the total number of days (14) by the daily rate ($12) to find the total amount charged. This calculation yields 14 * 12 = 168.

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we can set up a proportion to represent the rates of production for each type of ice cream.

Let's denote the number of quarts made in 48 hours as x. We can set up the following proportion:

(100 quarts / 2 hours) = (x quarts / 48 hours)

We can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying:

100 * 48 = 2x
4800 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 4800 / 2
x = 2400

However, this represents the number of quarts made from chocolate ice cream in 48 hours. To find the total number of quarts made, we need to add the number of quarts made from vanilla ice cream. Since the vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, we can set up another proportion:

(50 quarts / 4 hours) = (y quarts / 48 hours)

We can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying:

50 * 48 = 4y
2400 = 4y

Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 4:

y = 2400 / 4
y = 600

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is the sum of the quarts made from chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

Total quarts = 2400 + 600
Total quarts = 3000

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00 budget. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find the maximum number of scoops she can buy:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means that for every 3 scoops Erin buys, she only pays for 2. To find the total number of scoops she can get for her money, we can divide her budget by the cost of 3 scoops:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 (per 3 scoops) = 4 sets of 3 scoops

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can get a total of 4 sets × 3 scoops per set = 12 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 12 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of days in this period, which is 14 days.

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we can calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

We can convert the fraction 2/3 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 2 ÷ 3 = 0.67. 

Now, we multiply 0.67 by 36: 0.67 * 36 = 24.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is 576."
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of James' decision, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

In contrast, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the increase in price as follows:

10% of $700 = 0.1 x $700 = $70

Now, we add the increase to the original price to get the new price of each computer:

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

To find the total amount of money the company paid, we multiply the new price of each computer by the number of computers:

Total amount paid = $770 x 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we must consider the individual components. 

First, we calculate the calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories. 

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories. 

Lastly, we calculate the calories from the ham: 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we sum these values to determine the total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet has 770 calories."
"To determine the change, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3. 
The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2. 
The total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the total cost is $5 and the payment was $10, the change can be calculated as follows:
$10 - $5 = $5

The final answer is $5."
"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to calculate the percentage of people who receive a job offer and then find a third of that number.

First, we calculate 30% of 100 to find the number of people who receive interviews: 0.3 * 100 = 30.

Next, we find 20% of 30 to determine the number of people who receive a job offer: 0.2 * 30 = 6.

Finally, we calculate a third of 6 to find the number of people who accept the position: 6 / 3 = 2.

Therefore, 2 people accept the position."
"To determine the total weight of rice given away, we must first calculate the total number of sacks distributed. Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of rice given away can be calculated by multiplying the number of sacks by the weight per sack: 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

Therefore, the total weight of rice given away is 175 kilograms."
"To determine the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we can perform a simple subtraction operation.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

The difference between the two weeks is 8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs, we must consider the two distinct scenarios: when her arms are down and when they are up.

When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. This results in a combined rate of 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 5 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute, resulting in a combined rate of 400 taps per minute. She dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, so the total number of taps in this scenario is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

To find the overall total, we add the number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we must calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole is comprised of the damage to the car ($450) and the fine ($120), as well as the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt (3 * $25 = $75). Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 + $120 + $75 = $645.

To find the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of the fine: $645 (total cost) - $120 (fine) = $525.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is $525."
"To determine the total number of chairs left, we must first calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of chairs sent for repair.

The initial total number of chairs is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 170 + 23 = 193.

Next, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair, which is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total: 193 - 33 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 =  -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this indicates an error in the calculation.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can use the concept of ratios. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes the dog.

Let's denote the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages as x. We know that the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, and the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. So, we can set up the proportion:

9/30 = 9/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

9x = 30 * 9
9x = 270
x = 270/9
x = 30

Now that we know the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2:

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25

The final answer is 25."
"To solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = 100

To isolate 'x', we'll first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed for students' cars. We know that Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows. Since there are 64 students' cars, we can calculate this as:

Number of windows smashed for students' cars = (1/4) * 64
= 64/4
= 16

Next, we'll find the number of windows smashed for teachers' cars. We know that Hannah smashed three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows. Since there are 32 teachers' cars, we can calculate this as:

Number of windows smashed for teachers' cars = (3/4) * 32
= (3 * 32)/4
= 96/4
= 24

Now, we'll add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total:

Total windows smashed = 16 (students) + 24 (teachers)
= 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools. This can be achieved by adding the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing the quantities of all spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted, we can find this by multiplying 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Next, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. This can be done by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, so we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

3000 * (2/3) = 2000

Finally, we find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 days ÷ 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of smores needed. 

We have 9 kids who want 2 smores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each. The total number of smores needed is 9 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required: 24 / 8 = 3.

As there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are needed.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We know that Dora's age is 15 years, so D = 15.

We also know that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so F = 2D + 8.

Furthermore, Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so M = F - 4.

Substituting the expression for F into the equation for M, we get M = (2D + 8) - 4 = 2D + 4.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for D and M into the equation for the combined age: Combined age = D + F + M = 15 + (2D + 8) + (2D + 4).

Simplifying the expression, we get Combined age = 15 + 2D + 8 + 2D + 4 = 4D + 27.

Since D = 15, we can substitute this value into the expression for the combined age: Combined age = 4(15) + 27 = 60 + 27 = 87.

Therefore, the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we must divide the total amount of $20 by the number of siblings, which is 4.

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Therefore, each sibling received $5."
"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we must consider the weights of each book individually.

The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so their combined weight is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. The French book weighs 4 pounds, and the English book weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so its weight is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find Beck's initial number of apples by subtracting 23 from Boris's initial amount of 100 apples. This gives us 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Next, we calculate the number of apples each person has after Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the amount of water left, we must first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube.

The giant cubes use 4 ounces per cube, and Peter makes 3 of them, resulting in 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. The medium cubes use 2 ounces per cube, and Peter makes 7 of them, resulting in 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. The small cubes use 0.5 ounces per cube, and Peter makes 8 of them, resulting in 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add the total water used for each type of cube: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's total as 2x.

We are also given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total cost, we first need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Next, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first determine the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

Since the rest of the students like to play video games or music, we can subtract the students who like to bake and those who like to play basketball and music from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - (10 + 15) = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we first need to find the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the initial 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as follows:

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

Now, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds:

12 - 4 = 8

Next, we add the 20 birds that joined the backyard:

8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 ÷ 2 = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we add the initial 2 slices of cake to the 3 slices Mara added, resulting in 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, we triple the number of slices, which gives us 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Then, we subtract the 2 slices Mara ate, resulting in 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, we subtract the 5 slices her friend stole, giving us 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we must first calculate the total number of animals in need of grooming. This can be achieved by adding the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses.

The total number of animals is the sum of 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. 

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

The total value of the cards Mark found is the sum of the values of the two cards and the 30 cards worth $50 each:
$4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of each amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the family.

For the first amusement park, the cost is calculated as follows:
2 adults * $26 = $52
2 children * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the cost is calculated as follows:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

To find the amount saved by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park:
Amount saved = $76 - $48
Amount saved = $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the daily savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day. 

The original cost per day is 500 tomatoes * $0.5 = $250. 
The new cost per day is 500 tomatoes * $0.4 = $200.

Daily savings: $250 - $200 = $50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 * 7 = $350

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of marbles Carl has as C, the number of marbles Sean has as S, and the number of marbles Cal has as L.

We know that S = 56 and S = (1/2)L. We can use the second equation to express L in terms of S: L = 2S.

Substituting S = 56 into the equation L = 2S, we get L = 2(56) = 112.

We also know that C = 4S. Substituting S = 56 into this equation, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have by adding C and L: C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). However, since 54 is not divisible by 12 evenly, we can calculate the remainder.

54 ÷ 12 = 4 with a remainder of 6

This means that 54 students can be divided into 12 groups with 6 students left over. Since the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, we can conclude that 0 additional groups are required to accommodate the remaining 6 students.

The answer is: 0"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200 chairs. 
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800 chairs.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000 chairs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the banana count.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Then, Arnold stole half of them, leaving Gunther with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, bringing the total to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold then stole 12 bananas, reducing the count to 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, resulting in a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, on the third day, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity cost per roommate, we must first calculate the monthly cost per roommate. This is achieved by dividing the total monthly bill by the number of roommates.

The total monthly bill is $100, and there are 4 roommates. 

$100 ÷ 4 = $25

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost per roommate.

$25 × 12 = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we must first calculate the initial quantities and then subtract the number of broken items.

The initial number of glasses is 8 dozen, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, the initial number of plates is 4 dozen, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

We then subtract the number of broken items: 10 glasses and 6 plates. 

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of remaining items is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we must consider the information provided.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. The number of matches played on Saturday is double the number played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4.

To find the total, we add the matches played on each day: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can break down the information into parts and calculate each separately.

Let's start with the number of students needing each size:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Since twice as many students need size small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

Therefore, the total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To calculate the amount after the discount, we need to find 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

The marked price is $140. To find 5% of this amount, we multiply $140 by 0.05.

$140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

Therefore, the amount after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total number of hours the playlists will last, we can multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist: 20 * 300 = 6000.

Next, we multiply the result by the length of each song: 6000 * 10 = 60,000.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: 60,000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girls. We can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To isolate the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use the fact that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies. We can set up another equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To isolate the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To determine how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we must first calculate the amount of money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Next, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Now, we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of cases needed for the third house as x. We know that the first house needs half of the total, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we can write the equation:

x = 2 * 125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 250

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 250"
"To determine the total amount spent, we must calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila's expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the number of cucumbers (3) by the cost per cucumber ($2), resulting in 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack's expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the number of tomatoes (5) by the cost per tomato ($1), resulting in 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase's expenditure is $3 for one head of lettuce.

The total amount spent is the sum of these individual expenditures: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the number of pears, we can use the concept of percentages. If George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of bananas as B and the number of pears as P. We know that P = B + 0.45B, since George has 45% more pears than bananas.

We are given that George has 200 bananas, so B = 200. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 200 + 0.45(200)
P = 200 + 90
P = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
Total = B + P
Total = 200 + 290
Total = 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we must first calculate the remaining amount of money after purchasing the ball. This can be achieved by subtracting the cost of the ball from the initial amount of money.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Now, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars purchased.

Cost of each candy bar = $5
Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we must first calculate the amount of oranges required. Since 5 kilograms of oranges are needed for 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this quantity by 4 to find the total amount of oranges required for 4 liters of juice.

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total amount of oranges required by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, the total cost of making 4 liters of juice is $60."
"To determine the total number of books read, we must first establish the number of books read by Ahmed. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can calculate Ahmed's total by dividing Ezra's total by 2.

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

Therefore, the total number of books read is 600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her hourly wage is $15, so her total earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

Additionally, since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $300 + $5 = $305.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly wage is $15, so her total earnings for Wednesday can be calculated as:

2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Again, since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $60 + $5 = $65.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday:

$305 + $65 = $370

The final answer is: $370"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

The difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents is 4."
"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as x. Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135 and he has already made $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each, we can represent the total amount he needs to make from selling the corn as:

20 * 3 + 25x = 135

Simplifying the equation, we get:
60 + 25x = 135

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
25x = 75

Dividing both sides by 25:
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time she devotes to activities other than soccer. 

She reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. The remaining time after reading is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. 

The time spent playing video games is 1/3 of 9 hours, which is 3 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the total time spent on activities other than soccer: 3 hours (reading) + 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours.

The time spent playing soccer is the total weekend time minus the time spent on other activities: 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is 50%."
"To find the number of pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the remaining pencils after he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon and then 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

First, we'll find 1/2 of 50, which is 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, we'll find 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we must consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. We can calculate the time taken to drive to the museum as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

The total time spent driving is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time taken to drive back home:
Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total driving time = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, we get:
Total time Jack is gone from home = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the assembly of the toys. 

We know that each car requires 4 wheels and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed can be calculated as follows:

Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the total number of wheels for cars and motorcycles to find the overall number of wheels required:
Total wheels required = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Since Henry has 650 wheels in the box, we can find the number of wheels left by subtracting the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available:
Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, there will be 276 wheels left."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we can use the formula:

Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * Original Price
Discount = (20 / 100) * $1000
Discount = 0.20 * $1000
Discount = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

Therefore, the price after the discount is $800."
"To determine the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series, which is one-third of the total number of movies:
1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

Since Mike can get these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we calculate the cost of the series:
200 * $10 = $2000
Divide the cost by 6 to find the actual cost:
$2000 / 6 = $333.33

Next, we find the number of movies that are not in series. Subtract the number of series movies from the total:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies. Calculate this as:
0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

Now, we find the number of remaining movies that are not in series or older movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

These movies cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. Calculate the cost:
240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:
$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound, which equals $12.00.
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound, which equals $8.00.
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound, which equals $18.00.

The total cost is the sum of these individual costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We know that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed, so we can express the hiking speed as h = (d/2) - 5.

We are given that the driving speed is 50 mph, so d = 50. Substituting this value into the equation for the hiking speed, we get h = (50/2) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 mph.

Now, we know that the time spent driving is 6 hours, and the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. We can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance. Since the total time is the sum of the driving time and hiking time, we can express the driving time as 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance by multiplying the driving speed by the driving time:
Distance = d * (6 - 1.5)
Distance = 50 * 4.5
Distance = 225 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 225 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, while Emma's enemy points are 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on. Since Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, we can express this as:

Ava's enemy points = 10(x + 8)
Emma's enemy points = 10x

We also know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry points are 5 times the number of berries she collects, while Ava's berry points are 5 times the number of berries she collects. Since Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, we can express this as:

Ava's berry points = 5(x - 3)
Emma's berry points = 5x

Additionally, we know that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so Ava's time points are 30 times the number of seconds she finishes the level, while Emma's time points are 30 times the number of seconds she finishes the level. Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, we can express this as:

Ava's time points = 30(x + 4)
Emma's time points = 30(x - 4)

Now, we can set up the equation for the difference in scores:

A - E = (10(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) + 30(x + 4)) - (10x + 5x - 30)
A - E = 10x + 80 + 5x - 15 + 30x + 120 - 15x
A - E = 30x + 170

We also know that Ava's score is 1715, so we can set up the equation:

1715 = 30x + 170
1715 - 170 = 30x
1545 = 30x
x = 1545 / 30
x = 51.5

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the scores of Emma and Ava:

Emma's score = 10x + 5(x - 3) + 30(x - 4)
= 10(51.5) + 5(48.5) + 30(47)
= 515 + 242.5 + 1410
= 2167.5

Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) + 30(x + 4)
= 10(59.5) + 5(46.5) + 30(54)
= 595 + 232.5 + 1620
= 2147.5

The difference between their scores is 2147.5 - 2167.5 = -20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-20}$"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we must first subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 ÷ 2 = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For these 2 days, the total number of times is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try x = 4 and x = 5.

If x = 4, then 4 + x = 8, and 2(4 + x) = 2(8) = 16, which is not equal to 17.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day.

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Next, we need to convert the total miles driven to gallons of fuel consumed. We know that Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). To find the amount of fuel consumed, we can divide the total miles driven by the fuel efficiency:

Fuel consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of fuel consumed per week by multiplying the fuel consumed by the price per gallon:

Cost of fuel consumed per week = Fuel consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of fuel consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of fuel consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply 140 by $0.25 to find the total value of the quarters: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we must calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we'll calculate the total number of tomatoes. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and Ricardo has 5 plants, the total number of tomatoes is 5 * 22 = 110.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 plants, so the total number of eggplants is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we'll add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall total. 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

We know that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we must first calculate the total cost of the trip. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

Therefore, John is missing $150."
"To determine the number of logs needed to maintain a temperature of at least 32 degrees, we must first calculate the total temperature drop from day to night. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it drops by 33 degrees at night, resulting in a total temperature drop of 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log provides a 5-degree increase in temperature, we can calculate the number of logs required by dividing the total temperature drop by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

To maintain a temperature of at least 32 degrees, we must round up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot burn a fraction of a log. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups. We can do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people in each group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we can find the number of groups with seashells by multiplying the number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the final number of people on the train, we must consider the sequence of events. 

First, we start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 172. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, resulting in 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can use the following steps:

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day (10) by the number of days in the month (30) to find the total number of bottle caps collected:

10 bottle caps/day × 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Next, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap ($0.25):

300 bottle caps × $0.25 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings, we need to consider her regular and special hourly rates. 

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

Final answer: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first calculate the number of male lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over, we need to find 25% of the original price of the jeans, which is $40. 

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

Let's break it down:

- Initial number of employees: 200
- Monthly increase in employees: 20
- Total number of months: 3

The total number of employees after 3 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3, a1 = 200, and an = 200 + (20 * 3) = 260.

S = 3/2 * (200 + 260)
S = 1.5 * 460
S = 690

Now, we can calculate the total salary paid by multiplying the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid = 690 * $4000
Total salary paid = $2,760,000

The final answer is: $2,760,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to calculate the sum of the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we must first calculate their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a 2-month raise of $0.50 per hour, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received a $1.00 per hour raise, bringing his wage to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, which was $10. So, Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since Sally also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 - $10.50 * 20 = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 times the cost of one loaf, which is $2. Therefore, the total cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 times the cost of one bagel, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we must first calculate Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139.
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores together.

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we must consider the contributions of both the students and the teachers. 

First, we calculate the number of trees planted by the students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. As each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that total.

First, let's add up the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = 10.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals, then the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her progress into two distinct periods.

First, let's calculate the total hours played in the initial 2 weeks. Since Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days, we can multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Next, we'll calculate the total hours played in the subsequent week. Kris plays for 2 hours per day for 7 days, so we multiply the daily hours by the number of days: 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours played in both periods to find the total hours played so far: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will cover more distance in the same time frame as the first car.

Let's denote the speed of the first car as v1 and the speed of the second car as v2. We are given v1 = 60 miles/hour and v2 = 70 miles/hour. The time is t = 2 hours.

The distance traveled by the first car is d1 = v1 * t = 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
The distance traveled by the second car is d2 = v2 * t = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars is the difference in the distances they traveled: d = d2 - d1 = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to find 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $900. 

First, we find 30% of $900 by multiplying $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's start by finding the number of fifth-graders who passed. Since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, we can calculate it as follows:

Fifth-graders who passed = 2 * 40
= 80

Now, we can find the total number of students who passed by adding the number of students who passed in each grade:

Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders)
= 460

The total number of students in the school is the sum of students in each grade:

Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders)
= 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of square inches that can be created with the available glass chips. Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we can find the total number of square inches by dividing the total number of chips by 12.

Total number of chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips
Total square inches = Total number of chips / 12 chips/square inch = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by multiplying the number of square inches by the height.

Length = Total square inches * Height = 12 square inches * 3 inches = 36 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, resulting in 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, yielding 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea can be found by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has. 

Dale initially had 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. 

However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Since Dale wants to sell all of his candies, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x = 50, where x is the number of candies he still needs to sell.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, where the number of students doubles at the end of every month. We can model this growth using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * 2^t, where N0 is the initial number of students and t is the time in months.

Given that there are 10 students at the beginning of the year (January), we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

N(5) = 10 * 2^5
N(5) = 10 * 32
N(5) = 320

To find the additional students, we subtract the initial number from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = N(5) - N0
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we must first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

We have four types of flowers: those with 5 petals, those with 6 petals, those with 4 petals, and those with 7 petals. 

Let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we must first calculate the total number of marshmallows available for use. The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows, but 3 were dropped, leaving 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores that can be made is equal to the number of marshmallows remaining, which is 32.

John and DeSean have already made 9 S'mores each, so together they have made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we need to calculate the time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack's playing time is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is also x ounces.

Given that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. So, we can write the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we must calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 times $500, which equals $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 times $1500, which equals $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is the sum of these two amounts: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of cupcakes he already possesses. This can be achieved by adding the number of chocolate cupcakes to the number of toffee cupcakes.

Let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed to find out how many more he should purchase: 63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of cars Joe has as 'x'. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can express this as an equation: x = 2 * 20.

x = 40

Next, we need to find 20% of the total number of cars Joe has. This can be calculated as 0.2 * x.

0.2 * 40 = 8

Now, Joe sells 8 cars. To find the number of cars he has left, we subtract 8 from the total: 40 - 8 = 32.

However, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find the final number of cars Joe has, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from the number of cars he had after selling: 32 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we must first calculate the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the remaining amount, which is the total raised by the students, is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find the individual contribution. There are 20 students in total.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we must first determine the time she spent walking on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we can calculate this as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

The total time walked in two days is the sum of these two values: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

Therefore, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply the total number of cars by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35 cars.

To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

The final answer is 35."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to multiply the number of tasks he completes in a day by the number of days in a week and then multiply the result by the pay per task.

First, we find the total number of tasks completed in a week: 30 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 210 tasks/week.

Next, we multiply the total number of tasks by the pay per task: 210 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $252/week.

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $252.

The final answer is: $252"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type.

The total number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages (8) by the number of tins per package (11): 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

The total number of tins of dog food can be found by multiplying the number of packages (6) by the number of tins per package (6): 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cards each person has using variables. Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can break down the information provided:

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We know that Cindy had 5 green eggs, so G = 5.

We also know that she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so B = 2G = 2 * 5 = 10.

Additionally, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so Y = P / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is calculated as follows:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's purchase price:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Therefore, Milly will lose $8.

$8"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. She purchased two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which amounts to 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. The total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

**The final answer is 60.**"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we must first calculate the total production for the first three weeks. 

The production for the first week is 8,000 bars. The second week's production is half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week's production is three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, we add the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, we can subtract the production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider her activities and their respective durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours. 

Next, we calculate the time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting this to hours, we get 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week.

Now, we add the time spent on writing songs and doing makeup to get the total time spent on TikTok per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week.

Finally, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks) to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we subtract the standard quantities from the quantities Angela has:

- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:
- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has, we can break down the information provided. 

First, we know that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we're told that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4, which equals $12.

Finally, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total. $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to establish a chain of relationships between the heights each individual can lift.

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift 1 inch. Therefore, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we're told that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Lastly, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. Thus, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey and then sum them up.

Mason travels at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, then takes a rest, and finally travels for another 6 hours. 

The distance covered in the first 4 hours is 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles. 

The distance covered in the next 6 hours is 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in both segments: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning and rates. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the rate at which the kangaroos are traveling. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the rate of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Rate of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Rate of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Rate of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the rate of a turtle by dividing the rate of a kangaroo by 2.

Rate of a turtle = Rate of a kangaroo / 2
Rate of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Rate of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning to find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway. Since the rate of the turtles is half the rate of the kangaroos, the time it will take for the turtles to travel the same distance will be twice the time it takes for the kangaroos.

Time for turtles = 2 * Time for kangaroos
Time for turtles = 2 * 18 hours
Time for turtles = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, the number of dishes made by Rory as R, and the number of dishes made by Jada as J.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes, so K = 20.

We also know that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so R = K + 20.

Substituting K = 20 into the equation for R, we get R = 20 + 20 = 40.

Since Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, we can write J = 2R.

Substituting R = 40 into the equation for J, we get J = 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them to find the total number of dishes.

Total number of dishes = K + R + J
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we must consider the various factors that contribute to her overall savings. 

First, we know that the original price of the laptop is $600. When Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, resulting in a new price of $600 - $200 = $400. This reduction is a direct result of the trade-in, and it is essential to account for this when calculating Erika's total savings.

In addition to the trade-in, Erika has received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. These amounts are also crucial in determining her overall savings.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 230 from both sides of the equation:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total number of apple slices, we must consider the slicing capacity of both large and small apples. 

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from both types of apples: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15 slices.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the following equation:

5x = 25

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 additional cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. Multiply this fraction by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm) to find the length of the unused portion: (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Multiply this fraction by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm) to find the length of the unused portion: (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the unused portion, we can subtract the fraction of the used portion from 1: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Multiply this fraction by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm) to find the length of the unused portion: (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

To find the amount Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we must first calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of bills by the value of each bill.

Total amount paid = 4 * $20
Total amount paid = $80

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent. He acquired 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 x $2 = $12. Additionally, he purchased 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to an additional expenditure of 3 x $3 = $9. The combined total spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig initially possessed $40. To find the amount remaining, we subtract the total spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final amount Craig has left is $19."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of socks Peter has as P and the number of dishes Jack has as J.

From the problem statement, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we can write an equation:
P = 2J

We are also given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can write another equation:
J = 2P

Now, we are told that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute J = 60 into the second equation:
60 = 2P

To find the value of P, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
P = 60 / 2
P = 30

Now that we know Peter has 30 socks, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by substituting P = 30 into the first equation:
J = 2P
J = 2(30)
J = 60

Now that we know both Peter and Jack have 30 socks and 60 dishes, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total = P + J
Total = 30 + 60
Total = 90

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as U, the number of students good at math as M, and the number of students good at English as E.

We are given that there are 20 students in total (U = 20), 5 students good at math only, and 8 students good at English only. We need to find the number of students good at both math and English.

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can set up the following equation:

U = M + E - x

Substituting the given values, we get:

20 = M + 8 - x

We also know that M = 5 + x (since the number of students good at math is the sum of those good at math only and those good at both math and English).

Substituting M = 5 + x into the previous equation, we get:

20 = (5 + x) + 8 - x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 13

This implies that x = 7.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M = 5 + x
= 5 + 7
= 12

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is: 12"

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we need to calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount for each year:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = $750 + $225 = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

Let's perform the calculation:

Total number of eggs: 900
Number of eggs per tray: 30
Number of trays: 900 ÷ 30 = 30 trays

Now, multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray:
30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of goats left in each farm. 

Farm X initially had 55 goats and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Farm Y initially had 45 goats and twice as many were sold, which means 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we must first calculate the total number of pairs purchased in a year. Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can multiply this rate by 12 to find the total number of pairs purchased in a year.

Total pairs per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the total number of pairs purchased to find the average cost per pair.

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Total pairs per year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we have 3 baskets, but we get $2 off for each basket. So, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. The cost of the red food after the discount is $18 - $2 = $16. Then, the total cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $16 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of homes built in the first year, which is given as 12.

Next, we calculate the number of homes built in the second year, which is three times the number built in the first year: 3 * 12 = 36.

Then, we calculate the number of homes built in the third year, which is double the sum of the first two years: 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96.

Finally, we add the number of homes built in each year to find the total: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the unknowns as variables. Let's represent your age as 'x', your brother's age as 'b', your sister's age as 's', and your mom's age as 'm'.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. x = b - 3 (You are 3 years younger than your brother)
2. x = s + 2 (You are 2 years older than your sister)
3. m = 3b - 1 (Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
4. x + b + s + m = 87 (The sum of your ages is 87)

We can use substitution to solve for the unknowns. From equation (1), we can express b in terms of x: b = x + 3.

Substituting b into equation (3), we get m = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, substitute b and m into equation (4): x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the solution as a decimal, which is a valid answer.

The final answer is 15.6."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs, we can divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). 

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The correct answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day. This means the amount of water on the second day is 2 times the amount on the first day. 

The amount of water on the first day is 4000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water on the second day is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water on the third day, we add 6000 to the amount on the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"The problem at hand is a quintessential example of exponential growth. We have an initial population of 10 individuals, and each infected person contributes to the growth of the population by infecting six others. This creates a snowball effect, where the number of new infections multiplies rapidly.

To model this growth, we can use the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * (r^t), where N0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time period.

In this case, N0 = 10 and r = 6 (since each infected person infects 6 others). We want to find the total number of people infected after 3 days, so t = 3.

Plugging in the values, we get: N(3) = 10 * (6^3) = 10 * 216 = 2160.

However, this calculation only accounts for the new infections. To find the total number of people infected after 3 days, we need to add the initial 10 individuals to the result: 2160 + 10 = 2170.

Therefore, the total number of people infected after 3 days is 2170.

The final answer is: 2170"
"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the total amount of tips received by Rafaela. Since each of the 40 customers gave a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount: 40 * $20 = $800.

Next, we need to find 10% of the amount received by Rafaela, which is the amount received by Julieta. To do this, we multiply $800 by 0.1 (since 10% is equivalent to 0.1 as a decimal): $800 * 0.1 = $80.

Now, we subtract the amount received by Julieta from the amount received by Rafaela to find the amount received by Rafaela: $800 - $80 = $720.

Finally, we add the amounts received by both Julieta and Rafaela to find the total: $720 + $80 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges.

Next, we add the oranges given to her son: 6 oranges (given to daughters) + 3 oranges (given to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to consider the number of slices sold and the price per slice. Since Paige baked 2 loaves per hour and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices sold can be found by multiplying the number of loaves by 8.

Number of loaves baked = 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves
Number of slices = 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we can find the total amount raised by multiplying the number of slices by the price per slice.

Total amount raised = 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

Therefore, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a straightforward approach. We know that the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Consequently, the number of gold coins can be expressed as 'x + 30'. Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation: 

x + 30 = 70

Solving for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation, yielding:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins to be 40, we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we must first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
Total burritos eaten = 20

Now, we subtract the total burritos eaten from the total burritos given to the students to find the leftover burritos.
Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's use R for the number of red cars, G for the number of green cars, and Y for the number of yellow cars.

We are given the following information:

1. The rink has 12 red cars: R = 12
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars: G = R - 2
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars: B = 3G
4. The total number of cars is 75: R + G + B + Y = 75

We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the equation for B:

B = 3(R - 2)
B = 3(12 - 2)
B = 3(10)
B = 30

Now we can substitute the values for R, G, and B into the equation for the total number of cars:

12 + (12 - 2) + 30 + Y = 75
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75

To find the value of Y, we can subtract 52 from both sides:

Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables. Let Fawn have x books, Anne have y books, and Sofie have z books.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

The total number of books is 85, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, we can substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required to meet the demand. 

First, we find the total number of cups needed by multiplying the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will receive: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since each box yields 10 cups, we divide the total cups needed by 10 to find the number of boxes required: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's birthday party.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given.

The total cost of the phones is found by multiplying the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we need to calculate 40% of the total monthly expenditure. 

40% of $400 is calculated as 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find Keenan's weekly expenditure. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, we'll find 2/5 of 60 pieces. To do this, we'll multiply 2/5 by 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

Next, we'll subtract 10 pieces from the total. 
60 - 10 = 50 pieces

Now, we'll find 7/13 of the remaining 50 pieces. To do this, we'll multiply 7/13 by 50. 

7/13 * 50 = (7 * 50) / 13 = 350 / 13 = 26.92 (approximately)

Since we can't eat a fraction of a piece, we'll round down to 26 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 26 = 60 pieces

However, we need to consider that the total number of pieces is 60, and he ate all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 times $21.00, which equals $63.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 times $8.00, which equals $16.00.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we must first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we must first calculate her hourly rate. This can be achieved by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours worked: $33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Next, we multiply the hourly rate by the total number of hours worked: $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

Therefore, Ella's total earnings after 12 hours of dog walking would be $132."
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend. This is done by adding 52 (initial marbles) and 28 (marbles received), resulting in 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. This is calculated as 1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles lost (20) from the total number of marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend (80). This gives us 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, and Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 questions, we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.8 * 10 = 8. Since each correct answer is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is 8.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, and Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 questions, we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.9 * 20 = 18. Since each correct answer is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is 18.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Since each question is worth 5 points, and Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 questions, we can find the number of correct answers by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 0.6 * 5 = 3. Since each correct answer is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question to find the total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the cost of each chicken, we first need to calculate the total number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can find the number of chickens he plans to sell by multiplying 300 by 3/5.

(3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias sells each chicken for $50. To find the total amount of money he makes from selling 180 chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * $50 = $9000

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens he sold, we subtract the desired profit from the total amount of money he made:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, to find the cost of each chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold:

$7000 ÷ 180 = $38.89

Therefore, Isaias bought each chicken for $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to find out how many glasses Micah sold. Since the total number of glasses sold is 32 and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 3 to find the number of glasses each person sold.

32 glasses ÷ 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah is 3.33 glasses.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, so we can write the equation: x + 10 = 18.

Solving for x, we get x = 18 - 10 = 8.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. This can be represented as 3x.

We want to find the value of 'n' such that 3x = 24. 

Substituting x = 8, we get 3(8) = 24, which is true.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. Since her current age is 8, we can set up the equation: x + n = 24.

Substituting x = 8, we get 8 + n = 24.

Solving for n, we get n = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as x. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the equation can be set up as follows:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the current number of toys Argo has, we need to subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

The initial number of toys Argo had is 200. He gave away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

To find the current number of toys, we subtract the total given away from the initial number: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Argo now has 50 toys.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we can break it down as follows:

The shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. This gives us a total of 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas for these two days.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, which is 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs.

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

So, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"To determine the total number of birds, we must calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead: 2/3 * 6 = 4.

Next, we calculate the number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of birds is 34."
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies. This can be achieved by subtracting 5 from the initial total of 55 cookies.

55 - 5 = 50

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars, which is 5, to find the number of cookies in each jar.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

Therefore, each jar contains 10 cookies."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be found by multiplying the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

The total number of petals on the daisies can be found by multiplying the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to find the number of flowering plants. 

We know that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so the remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * 2/3 = 50. 

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x meters per second. We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Setting up the equation: 11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 121 / 11 = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

"To find the cost of one carrot, let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. We know that Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it costs $6/2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2x + 9 = 11, where 2x is the cost of two carrots.

Solving for x, we subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 11 - 9, which simplifies to 2x = 2.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2/2 = 1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to first determine his new hourly wage. 

The original hourly wage was $10, and it was increased by $2. 

$10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week.

$12 * 8 * 5 = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. Similarly, since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we can represent the total amount she earned from mowing lawns as 6x. We also know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x + 80 = 80

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that Tasha earned $80 from mowing lawns and then gave it back. Let's re-examine the problem.

Since Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, we can represent the total amount she earned from mowing lawns as:

6x + 3x + 5x = 80

Combine like terms:

14x = 80

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 80 / 14
x = 5.71 (round down to 5, as we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time)

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 5 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 5 = 15 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 5 = 25 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 5 + 15 + 25 = 30 + 15 + 25 = 70

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
80 - 70 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can analyze the given information step by step:

Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as X, and Harry's weight as H.

Given:
1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. X = C + 8
4. H = X - 5

Substituting the values, we get:
C = 55 + 16 = 71 kg
X = 71 + 8 = 79 kg
H = 79 - 5 = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit, we must first calculate his total earnings from renting his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours worked per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. Given that he earns $25 per hour, his total earnings per month are 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Next, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit. Therefore, his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's represent the number of notebooks Joseph had initially as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's initial number of notebooks as 3x.

We are told that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2 / 3
x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph had 2/3 notebooks initially, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2/3 = 7 - 0.67
= 6.33

Therefore, Martha has 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is 6.33."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by Susan's husband. 

We start with the total number of cookies: 100. Then, we subtract the cookies taken by the husband: 100 - 4 = 96.

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies."
"To determine the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate the pages read by each of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine the total amount spent by William, we must calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks can be found by multiplying the number of notebooks (5) by the cost per notebook ($1.50), resulting in 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. 

The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen, which is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

Therefore, William spent $8 in total."
"To determine the total material needed, we must calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the material needed for the small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 20 small masks:

4 small masks / 2 yards = 20 small masks / x yards

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

4x = 20 * 2
4x = 40
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

Now, let's find the material needed for the large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 8 large masks:

3 large masks / 2.25 yards = 8 large masks / y yards

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply and divide:

3y = 8 * 2.25
3y = 18
y = 18 / 3
y = 6 yards

Now, we can add the material needed for small and large masks to find the total material needed:

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can use the formula:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

Given that Deepa has spent $216 on 27 tickets, we can calculate the average price per ticket as follows:

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day, which is 24. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

The total hours spent on these activities is 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to calculate twice the number of books Sarah has and then subtract the number of books he lost.

Since Sarah has 9 books, we multiply this number by 2 to find the initial number of books Joseph had: 9 * 2 = 18.

Next, we subtract the number of books Joseph lost, which is 2, from the initial number of books he had: 18 - 2 = 16.

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find 1/5 of 30, which is the number of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. 

1/5 * 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald.

6 (marbles given to Jamie) + 10 (marbles given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total.

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get:

60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 per hour, we can find this by subtracting 10 from 50, which equals 40 packages per hour.

Next, we multiply the number of packages completed per hour by the number of hours worked, which is 8. This gives us 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Finally, we multiply the total number of packages completed by the payment per package, which is $0.20. This yields 320 * 0.20 = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday."
"To determine the total time John spends on sudoku, we must first calculate the time for the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

The normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and the extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that duration. Therefore, the time for the extreme sudoku puzzle is 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of the time for the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by 30 minutes.

Number of bottles of water = Total time / 30 minutes = 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. We can substitute this value into the equation:
2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we must first calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles per day, so in 30 days, he drives a total of 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since his car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works in three days, we can break down his work hours for each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

First, we calculate the total amount spent on the cake and ice cream: $11 + $7 = $18.

Next, we calculate the total amount spent on balloons: 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons, and each balloon costs $0.5, so the total amount spent on balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially.

$24 / 2 = $12.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12."
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira bought, we must add the quantities of each type of fruit.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we must subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To determine the total number of students, we must calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of students playing volleyball, which is twice the number playing tennis. Since there are 6 students playing tennis, there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is 16 boys and 22 girls, for a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we add the number of students playing each sport together: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to determine the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

First, we find the total number of lollipops sold by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Next, we calculate the profit per lollipop by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $0.8 (selling price) - $0.5 (cost price) = $0.3 (profit per lollipop).

Finally, we find the total profit by multiplying the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 lollipops * $0.3 (profit per lollipop) = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate equations for each type of pet.

Let's denote the number of cats as C, dogs as D, rabbits as R, fish as F, and gerbils as G.

We know that Larry has 3 cats, so C = 3.

We also know that he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so D = 3C = 3 * 3 = 9.

Additionally, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so R = D - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7.

Furthermore, he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so F = 3R = 3 * 7 = 21.

Lastly, his collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so G = 1/3F = 1/3 * 21 = 7.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: C + D + R + F + G = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we must first calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh. Abby consumes 2 slices per day, while Josh consumes twice as much, which equates to 4 slices per day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of their individual daily consumption: 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6) to find the number of days the loaf will last: 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha has collected 60 shells."
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first calculate the total number of mint tea cups. This can be found by subtracting the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups: 27 - 15 = 12.

Since the cups are divided into 3 rows, we can then divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the total time available and the time required for each trip. The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries and each round trip (down and back up the tree) takes 4 hours.

First, we calculate the total number of round trips the sloth can make in 8 hours: 8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips.

Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of round trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per round trip.

24 berries / 2 round trips = 12 berries per round trip.

However, this calculation assumes the sloth picks berries on both the way down and the way up. To find the number of berries picked per trip (down and up), we need to multiply the berries per round trip by 2.

12 berries per round trip * 2 = 24 berries per trip.

The final answer is 24."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we must first calculate the initial volume of water transferred from the pool. Since the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, the initial volume of water in the tank is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the remaining volume after 6 days, we subtract the total amount emptied from the initial volume:

5,000 - (500 * 6) = 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for his popcorn and candy expenses.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so his remaining budget is $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to determine the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

The bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can calculate the distance traveled by the bus as follows:

Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car, on the other hand, traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance traveled by the car as follows:

Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we must first calculate the total number of toys Sophie already possessed. This can be achieved by adding the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings.

The number of blocks is 31, the number of stuffed animals is 8, and the number of stacking rings is 9. 

Total number of toys Sophie already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we need to find the number of bouncy balls. We know that the total number of toys Sophie now has is 62. 

Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's start by writing the given information as equations:

Let P be Peter's age, P + 10 be Paul's age, and J be Jean's age.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

P = P + 10 + J

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = 10 + J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10 = J

Now that we have found Jean's age, we can substitute J = -10 into the first equation:

P + (P + 10) + (-10) = 100

Combine like terms:

2P = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

P = 50

Therefore, Peter's age is 50 years.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of balloons, we must first calculate the initial number of balloons. Since Maria and her 4 friends each received 2 balloons, we can calculate the total as follows:

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Additionally, Maria had 1 balloon for herself. Therefore, the total number of balloons is:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we can find the total number of balloons by adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. 

The charity group received 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To determine the average total distance spat, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each individual. 

Zoey's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (40) by the distance each seed is spat (10 feet): 
40 * 10 = 400 feet

Sydney's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (35) by the distance each seed is spat (12 feet): 
35 * 12 = 420 feet

The total distance spat by both is the sum of their individual distances: 
400 + 420 = 820 feet

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it produces 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will produce 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it produces 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will produce 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6 = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6 = $192,000

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we first calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay, which is 1000 pesos. 

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we compare the cost of the extended stay to the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first establish the amount of hay each animal requires. 

Let's denote the amount of hay each goat needs as 'g' and the amount each sheep needs as 's'. We are given that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so g = 5. 

We are also given that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so s = 2g - 3. 

Substituting g = 5 into the equation for s, we get s = 2(5) - 3 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for each type of animal. The total amount of hay needed for goats is 15g, and the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12s.

15g = 15(5) = 75 pounds
12s = 12(7) = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we must first calculate his total earnings. 

John's hourly wage is $50, and he worked for 6 hours, resulting in a total of $50 * 6 = $300.

He then spends $50 on gas, leaving him with $300 - $50 = $250.

Next, he purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, totaling $5 * 5 = $25. After this purchase, he has $250 - $25 = $225.

John aims to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with $225 - $100 = $125.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25: $125 ÷ 25 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we can multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Let's denote the number of words spelled by Craig as 'C' and the number of letters in each word as 'L'. We are given that C = 20 and L = 15. 

The total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig is C * L = 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Let's denote the number of words spelled by Craig's brother as 'B'. We are given that B = C + 10 (since they take turns and Craig has already spelled 20 words). 

The total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig's brother is B * L = (C + 10) * 15 = (20 + 10) * 15 = 30 * 15 = 450.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total letters spelled by Craig and Craig's brother: 300 + 450 = 750.

The final answer is 750."
"To determine the total number of children, we can multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows. 

The number of children in each row is 8, and there are 7 rows. 

The total number of children can be calculated as follows:

8 (children in each row) * 7 (number of rows) = 56

Therefore, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

The final answer is: 842"
"To determine the total cost, we must calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). This results in $78.75.

The total fixed charge is $40.

The cost of parts is $60.

Now, we add these values together to find the total cost: $78.75 + $40 + $60 = $178.75.

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount, we can multiply the number of CDs by the original price per CD.

10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. Since James received 40% off, we can find the discount amount by multiplying the total cost by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final cost after the discount.

Final cost = Total cost - Discount amount
= $150 - $60
= $90

To determine how much money James made from selling the CDs, we can multiply the number of CDs sold by the selling price per CD.

5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the amount James made to find out how much money James was out.

Money James was out = Amount made - Final cost
= $200 - $90
= $110

The correct answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total value of each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, we'll calculate the value of the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the value of the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20.

Then, we'll calculate the value of the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Let's denote the total time as T, the initial swimming time as S, the rest time as R, and the remaining swimming time as M.

We know that James swims 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour. This means he covers 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles at 2 miles per hour. We can calculate the time spent swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour as:

S = Distance / Speed
S = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
S = 6 hours

Next, James rests on the island for half the time he spent swimming, which is R = S/2 = 6/2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles, and James swims this at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. We can calculate the time spent swimming 8 miles at 1 mile per hour as:

M = Distance / Speed
M = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
M = 8 hours

The total time is the sum of the initial swimming time, rest time, and remaining swimming time:

T = S + R + M
T = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
T = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a straightforward approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be expressed as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a loaf, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sam had approximately 15 loaves of bread last Friday.

Now, we can find the number of loaves the bakery has by multiplying 7 by the number of loaves Sam had and subtracting 40:

7 * 15 - 40
105 - 40
65

The bakery has 65 loaves of bread."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has, we need to consider the sequence of events. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. This results in a net change of 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

Subsequently, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for her efforts. To find the final total, we add these 5 stickers to the net change: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

Therefore, Jasmine now possesses 13 stickers."
"To calculate the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times. The commission rate is 10% and the cost of each copy is $5. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies by the commission rate and the cost of each copy.

Commission for the New York Times = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal. The commission rate is 8% and the cost of each copy is $15. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies by the commission rate and the cost of each copy.

Commission for the Wall Street Journal = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Now, let's add the commissions together to find the total commission.

Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Deanna's age as D, and Marcus's age as M.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21.

Additionally, we are told that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = L/2.

Substituting the value of M into the second equation, we get 21 = L/2.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in L = 2 * 21 = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Dinar's score be x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score is x + 10. We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's score can be represented as (x + 10) - 20.

The total score of the three individuals is 45, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3

x = 18.33

However, since scores are typically whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Let's assume Dinar scored 18 points.

Now, we can find Azibo's score:

Azibo's score = (x + 10) - 20
= (18 + 10) - 20
= 28 - 20
= 8

Therefore, Azibo scored 8 points.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled, we need to determine the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, we calculate the minutes from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, which is 4 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 4 hours by 60 to get 240 minutes.

Next, we calculate the minutes from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 11 hours. We multiply 11 hours by 60 to get 660 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes from both time periods: 240 + 660 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

Therefore, Vince stapled 60 reports in total."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim's usual sleep period is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her total sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. We need to subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time.

Next, we need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and she usually wakes up at 6 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time.

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:45 a.m.

Now, we need to subtract the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time to find the time she was sleepwalking. 

10 p.m. - 3:45 a.m. = 6:15 p.m.

However, we are only interested in the time she was sleepwalking, which is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to her total sleep time.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she was sleepwalking: 
2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Now, we can calculate her total sleep time by adding the minutes she was sleepwalking to her usual sleep time.

480 minutes + 23 minutes = 503 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{503}$"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

Next, we need to consider the daily increase in occupied beds. 50 patients are admitted each day. 

Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700. 

The total number of occupied beds will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the beds admitted over 2 weeks, which is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we must first calculate the number of non-work emails. 

We know that Robyn sends a total of 16 emails per day, and 7 of those are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9

Next, we are told that two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. To find the number of emails sent to her family, we can multiply the number of non-work emails by 2/3:

(2/3) * 9 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her boyfriend. We know that one-third of the non-work emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find the number of emails sent to her boyfriend, we can multiply the number of non-work emails by 1/3:

(1/3) * 9 = 3

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails to her boyfriend per day.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can use the given information. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. 

First, we find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3: 
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported and subtract it from the reported number.

20% of a number can be calculated by multiplying the number by 0.20. 

Let's denote the number of people as x. The equation becomes: 
0.20x = 0.20 * 48
0.20x = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from x:
x - 9.6 = 38.4

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 0.20:
x = 9.6 / 0.20
x = 48

However, this is the number reported by Courtney. To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we can express Jason's balls as 2x. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, we can express Jordan's balls as 2(2x) = 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation 2x = 2. Solving for x, we find that x = 1.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of balls carried by each individual:
Jeffrey's balls = x = 1
Jason's balls = 2x = 2
Jordan's balls = 4x = 4

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = 1 + 2 + 4
Total balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. 

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29 (10 + 13 + 6). Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation:

10 + 13 + 6 + x = 4 * 29

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

29 + x = 4 * 29

Simplify the right side of the equation:

29 + x = 116

Subtract 29 from both sides of the equation:

x = 116 - 29

x = 87

Therefore, the pirates dug 87 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 87"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of corn chips each of the first two people (Amora and Lainey) got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

3x + 15 = total number of corn chips

We also know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so the total number of corn chips is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we can set up the equation:

3x + 15 = 140

Subtract 15 from both sides:

3x = 125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 41.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can find the exact total number of corn chips by multiplying x by 3 and adding 15.

Total number of corn chips = 3x + 15
= 3(41.67) + 15
= 125 + 15
= 140

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 140.

The final answer is 140."
"To determine the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

First, we find 50% of $400 by multiplying 400 by 0.5, which equals $200. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

Additionally, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now, we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we must first establish the total number of episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes by dividing the total minutes per episode by 2.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can calculate the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the journey into three segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

The bird travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 10 hours in the southerly direction. Using the formula: distance = rate * time, we can calculate the distance traveled in the first segment as follows:

distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird changes direction and travels at a speed of 18 miles per hour for 2 hours in the northerly direction. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance traveled in the second segment as follows:

distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird changes direction again and travels at a speed of 22 miles per hour for 5 hours in the southerly direction. Using the formula once more, we can calculate the distance traveled in the third segment as follows:

distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is the sum of the distances traveled in the first and third segments minus the distance traveled in the second segment:

net distance = (300 miles + 110 miles) - 36 miles
net distance = 374 miles - 36 miles
net distance = 338 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 338 miles."
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had, we must consider the individual quantities of brownies she received and made. 

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, this is the base amount.

At the office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1/2 by 12, which equals 6. Therefore, she received 6 brownies at the office party.

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we multiply 4 by 12 to find the total number of brownies her friends brought. This equals 48.

Now, we add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

Total brownies = 12 (made) + 6 (office party) + 48 (friends' contribution)
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 to a whole number, we multiply 1 by 12 and add 1/2. This equals 12 + 6, which is 18. Therefore, 18 brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To determine the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of racquet:

- Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add the time for each type of racquet: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, the cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total cost of the phones is $2100."
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. 

We are given that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. This can be expressed as an equation: 

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7

Substituting the given value, we get:

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7
= 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in both teams:

Total number of players = Number of players in Carlton's team + Number of players in Zeke's team
= 13 + 20
= 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is 100."
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she initially had. Since each box contains 20 oranges and she purchased 12 boxes, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave to her mom and sister. Since they each received 2 boxes, the total number of oranges given away is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we calculate the number of oranges she kept for herself, which is 1/4 of the total. To find 1/4 of 240, we can multiply 240 by 1/4 or divide 240 by 4. The latter method is more efficient in this case. 240 ÷ 4 = 60.

Finally, to determine the number of oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept and the number given away from the total. So, 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

The final answer is 140."
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we must first establish the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Next, we calculate half of 50, which is 25. Since India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states for India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8
Total cost = $39

Tyler has saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount saved from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14
Amount needed = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work:

Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $25 / $5
Number of hours = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'x'. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can express Robert's cherries as 'x + 10'. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 cherries. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) = 60

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 60

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 25

Now that we know Richard has 25 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's and Robert's cherries from the total:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 25
Jerry's cherries = 5

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 5
Robert has 25 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total earnings for the two days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of gingerbread and apple pie sold, and the cost of each item.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that G = 10 and A = G - 4.

On Sunday, the number of gingerbread boxes sold is G + 5, and the number of apple pie boxes sold is A - 4.

The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box. The total earnings for each day can be calculated as follows:

Saturday's earnings = (G * 6) + (A * 15)
= (10 * 6) + ((10 - 4) * 15)
= 60 + (6 * 15)
= 60 + 90
= $150

Sunday's earnings = ((G + 5) * 6) + ((A - 4) * 15)
= ((10 + 5) * 6) + ((10 - 4) * 15)
= (15 * 6) + (6 * 15)
= 90 + 90
= $180

The total earnings for the two days = $150 + $180
= $330

The final answer is: $330"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total number of hours she will be outside. Since she will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, the total number of hours is:

4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

As her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles needed by dividing the total number of hours by the number of ounces per bottle:

32 hours / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
= $100 - $40
= $60

The price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation: 24 = D/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 48 = D.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation: 24 = 2B.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 12 = B.

Now we have the current ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12).

To find the sum of their ages, we add the three ages together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the sum of the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Let's start by adding the beads given by her mother, which is 20.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so we can express this as 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which can be calculated as 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we must calculate the amount he caught each day.

First, we calculate the amount caught on Friday, which is 4 times the amount caught on Thursday. This is equivalent to 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount caught on Saturday, which is half the amount caught on Friday. This is equivalent to 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught:
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we must first convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to account for the space between each plant. Pat requires 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is equivalent to 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches. 

Now, we subtract the space between plants from the total length of the bed: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches): 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5.

Since Pat cannot fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to purchase 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is $552."
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can start by finding the daily consumption of his brother. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this by multiplying Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2.

18 pretzels/day * 1/2 = 9 pretzels/day

Next, we multiply the daily pretzel consumption of Edgar's brother by 7 to find the weekly consumption.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of petunias per basket (3) and the cost per petunia ($3.00). This gives us 5 * 3 * 3 = 45.

The cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of vines per basket (2) and the cost per vine ($2.50). This gives us 5 * 2 * 2.50 = 25.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: 45 + 25 = 70.

Therefore, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70."
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, we can subtract the amount used from the total to find the amount remaining: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide that by the cost of each pair of shoes.

First, we find 25% of her monthly income: 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12: $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of each pair of shoes: $6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the process into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, let's analyze the peeling process. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6, which equals 15 minutes.

Next, we need to consider the cooking process. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 30, which equals 3 minutes.

Since these two processes are independent, we can add the times together to find the total time: 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the final temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

Let's denote the initial temperature as T. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so the total cooling effect is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it ran on high for 4 hours, resulting in an additional cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room also warmed up during the 2 hours the air conditioner was off, resulting in a warming effect of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. This can be represented as:

Bill's age = 3 * (30 + x)

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up an equation to represent the time elapsed since Bill's dad saw the comet:

x + 75 = Bill's age

We can substitute the expression for Bill's age from the first equation into the second equation:

x + 75 = 3 * (30 + x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 90 + 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

75 = 90 + 2x

Subtracting 90 from both sides gives us:

-15 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = -15/2

75 = 90 + 2x

Subtracting 90 from both sides gives us:

-15 = 2x

However, we made the same mistake again. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. This can be represented as:

Bill's age = 3 * (30 + x)

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up an equation to represent the time elapsed since Bill's dad saw the comet:

x + 75 = Bill's age

We can substitute the expression for Bill's age from the first equation into the second equation:

x + 75 = 3 * (30 + x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 90 + 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

75 = 90 + 2x

Subtracting 90 from both sides gives us:

-15 = 2x

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each check type.

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, a check for the gas bill once per month, and two checks per month for the church. Additionally, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which translates to 4 checks per year.

We can calculate the total number of checks per month by adding the frequency of each type of check: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

To find the total number of checks per year, we multiply the monthly total by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year.

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation: x = 44 * 2.

Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is 88 * 3/4 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is (88 - 66) / 2 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To determine the combined length of time, we must first calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve for the age of Wilfred, we can start by denoting the unknown age as W. We know the total age of the children is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4, respectively. Let's denote Helene's age as H.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

H + 3 + 4 + W = 20

Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can express this as:

H = 2 * (3 + 4 + W) / 4

Substituting the expression for H into the first equation, we get:

2 * (3 + 4 + W) / 4 + 3 + 4 + W = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(6 + 2W) / 2 + 7 + W = 20

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

6 + 2W + 14 + 2W = 40

Combine like terms:

4W + 20 = 40

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4W = 20

Divide both sides by 4:

W = 5

The age of Wilfred is 5."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. The total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, reducing the total amount to $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the new total amount, which is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies given away. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

Half of the cookies were given to the church, so we divide the total number of cookies by 2: 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given away by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15 = 50.

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To divide the watermelon among the family members, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x and the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

Since there are 6 family members in total, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Now, let's consider the size of the slices. Let's assume the size of a kid's slice is y. Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, the total size is:

2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y

We want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total size of the adult slices is 2(2y) = 4y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, divide the size of the adult slices by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the time left for updating records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Inpatient rounds: 9 patients * 20 minutes per patient = 180 minutes
Appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, subtracting the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to make the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process.

The time needed for each step is as follows:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Final answer: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. This can be represented by the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

7x = 64

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to isolate x:

x = 64 / 7
x = 9.14 (approximately)

However, since we're dealing with whole boxes of chocolate bars, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 9 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons for a month.

Let's break it down:

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75. To find the monthly cost, we multiply this by 4: $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Multiplying this by 4 gives us the monthly cost: $15 * 4 = $60.

Now, we add the monthly cost of renting the studio ($300) and the monthly cost of the students' lessons ($60) to find the total expected earnings: $300 + $60 = $360.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. This can be represented as 7x = 56.

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of each equation by the number of boxes:

x = 64 / 4
x = 56 / 7

x = 16
x = 8

Since we want to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of female porcupines, we can calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. Since the pool is a rectangular prism, we can use the formula:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 7.33 (not 5.9) to calculate the total gallons of water needed, as 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.33 gallons.

Total gallons = Volume x 7.33
Total gallons = 1400 x 7.33
Total gallons ≈ 10300 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 10300 x 0.10
Cost ≈ $1030

The cost to fill the pool is approximately $1030."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we must first calculate the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

The number of blue sticks is 9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so it is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can calculate the distance each of them covered.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is 230."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into two groups: students over 16 years old and students under 16 years old.

First, we calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the total students are over 16, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this age group.

Now, we find the number of male students over 16. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so we calculate 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. Half of these students are male, so we calculate 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Next, we find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the number of laps each individual can run.

First, we establish the number of laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we can find 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He purchased 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He purchased 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He purchased 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He purchased 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we can subtract the total amount spent on other fruits from his total earnings to find the amount left: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this result is not possible, as Jamaar cannot spend a negative amount. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Jamaar actually spent $10.25, which exceeds his initial $10. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To determine the number of pieces each of Anne's friends received, we must first calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of pieces in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 900 pieces. 

To find the number of pieces given away, we subtract the number of pieces kept from the total: 900 - 120 = 780 pieces.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and n is the number of years.

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $120, the annual interest rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years (n) is 3.

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 × 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 × 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use a simple proportion. We know that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can break down the information as follows:

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91 guests.

After 7 more guests checked in after dinner, the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can break down the problem into three parts:

1. On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To determine the number of easy questions, we multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of easy questions (40% or 0.4):
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2:
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 3x * y, and the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y. We can set up the equation:

3x * y + 8y = 120

Since we know the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, we can substitute 3x with 3 * 4 = 12:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Now that we have found the value of y, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold, which is 2y:

2y = 2 * 6
2y = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption of the family. 

The man consumes 5 sandwiches per day, his wife consumes 4 sandwiches per day, and their son consumes 2 sandwiches per day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of these individual amounts: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

To find the total consumption for the week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total earnings from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

The total earnings from cookies can be found by multiplying the number of cookies sold (80) by the price per cookie ($1), which equals $80. 

Next, we calculate the total earnings from cupcakes by multiplying the number of cupcakes sold (60) by the price per cupcake ($4), resulting in $240.

Now, we add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne then gave her two sisters $10 each, for a total of $20. To find her remaining earnings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by the twins. Since there are two twins, each finding 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 30 + 30 = 60.

Next, we need to subtract the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs. The problem states that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Therefore, the number of eggs not found by the friends is 10.

Now, we can calculate the number of eggs found by the friends by subtracting the number of eggs not found by the friends from the total number of eggs: 100 - 10 = 90.

However, we must also account for the eggs found by the twins, as they are not part of the friends. Therefore, the correct calculation is 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe.

First, we establish the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. Since a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe, and an iron pickaxe enables a dwarf to mine twice as much as with bare hands, we can calculate the daily ore mining capacity as follows:

- A dwarf with bare hands mines 12 pounds per day.
- An iron pickaxe doubles this amount to 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
- A steel pickaxe increases this amount by 50%, making it 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we calculate the total daily ore mining capacity of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply this daily capacity by the number of days in a month (30): 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's analyze the given information:

We have three packages with different quantities of sandwiches: 2, 4, and 8. The prices are $3, $6, and an unknown price for the 8-sandwich package, respectively.

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to relate the quantities and prices of the packages. Let's denote the unknown price as x.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 3 * 8
2x = 24
x = 24/2
x = 12

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount owed after Tom uses the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

The remaining amount owed is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to consider the changes in the number of balloons at each stage.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10. Therefore, 10 red balloons burst.

Next, we find the number of red balloons remaining: 25 - 10 = 15.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released: half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released.

Now, we determine the number of yellow balloons remaining: 12 - 6 = 6.

We also find the number of blue balloons added: 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6. Thus, 6 blue balloons were added.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: $\boxed{80\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty. 

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000. Subtracting the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we get:

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

Now, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates, which is 950. 

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We also know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = M/3.

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for S: S = 150/3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we must first determine her daily income after expenses. 

Daily income after expenses = Daily income - Daily expenses
Daily income after expenses = $15 - $3
Daily income after expenses = $12

Next, we calculate the total hours worked:
Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 3 days
Total hours worked = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate Melissa's hourly wage:
Hourly wage = Total hours worked / Total hours worked per day
Hourly wage = 18 hours / 6 hours/day
Hourly wage = 3

Therefore, Melissa's hourly wage after expenses is $3."
"To determine the total amount spent by Ted, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ted is 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can use the formula for calculating the total time for a series of discrete events. 

First, we need to find the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway. The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

Number of bottles = Total width / Width per bottle
= 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle
= 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

Total time = Number of moves * Time per move
= 7 * 5 seconds
= 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

The total number of apples is 2 boxes * 40 apples per box = 80 apples. 

Dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack (8) gives us:

80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

The total amount of money Jim lost while in school is $200,000, which is the sum of the annual loan amount ($50,000) and the lost income ($150,000, calculated as $25,000 x 4 years). 

The total amount of money Jim earned after graduating is $300,000, which is his new income ($75,000) multiplied by the number of years he worked (4).

To find the break-even point, we can set up an equation:

Total amount lost + Total amount earned = Total amount needed

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

Now, we can calculate the break-even point by dividing the total amount needed by Jim's new income:

$500,000 / $75,000 = 6.67 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we must calculate the area of the comforter. The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we can calculate the dimensions of the fabric as follows:

Length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
Width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. Then, we add 17 to this result, which gives us 85 + 17 = 102 letters delivered on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. Then, we add 5 to this result, which gives us 204 + 5 = 209 letters delivered on Wednesday.

Now, we add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad can be found by multiplying the number of people who want it (10) by the cost per person ($6.50). This gives us 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is found by multiplying the number of people who want it (6) by the cost per person ($6). This gives us 6 * $6 = $36.

To find the total amount Molly will pay, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To calculate the average amount lost, we need to determine the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, the amount lost is $5.

In the second race, the amount won is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race, which is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, the amount lost is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To calculate the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. 

We start by multiplying the number of countries (26) by the number of cities in each country (5), which yields 130. Then, we multiply this result by the population of each city (1000), resulting in a total population of 130,000.

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000."
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we must first convert their heights to a common unit. Since Xavier's height is given in feet and inches, we can convert it to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's height is already given in inches, so we can proceed with the calculation. 

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

We are given that the second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

The first person's share is $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can start by converting 3/8 of a day into hours.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Next, we multiply the daily hours by 7 days to account for the 3-week period:
9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
63 hours ÷ 4 painters = 15.75 hours

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. 

We can write the equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the value of an object (in this case, a car) that depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This is a classic example of exponential decay.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- A(t) is the value of the object at time t
- A0 is the initial value of the object (in this case, $20,000)
- r is the rate of depreciation (in this case, 21% or 0.21)
- t is the time in years

We want to find the value of the car in 2010, which is 3 years after the initial purchase. Plugging in the values, we get:

A(3) = 20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * (0.79)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * 0.631519
A(3) = 12,638.38

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,638.38.

$12,638.38"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the books are written in German, so there are 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can subtract the distance she has already covered (325 kilometers) from the total distance to New York City (1955 kilometers).

Let's perform the calculation:

1955 (total distance) - 325 (distance driven) = 1630

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To determine the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can start by multiplying the number of cups she drinks per day (8) by the number of days (30). This gives us a total of 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can then divide the total cups by 16 to find the total gallons. 

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. This results in a net increase of 100 - 50 = 50 people. Adding this to the previous total, we get 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, reducing the total to 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes are on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total cost of the athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate the total yearly cost, we need to first find the increased monthly cost. 

The normal cost is $120, and the increase is 60% of this amount. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased monthly cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$192 x 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we must first calculate the number of loads per week. 

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, which means he needs to wash 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we know that two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Then, last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. 

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. 

Now, we can add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams).

This can be calculated as follows:

720 grams ÷ 60 grams per day = 12 days

Therefore, the cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'x'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as 'x + 3'. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia's slices can be represented as '2x'.

We know that the total number of slices is 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 32. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) + 2x = 32

Combine like terms:

4x + 3 = 32

Subtract 3 from both sides:

4x = 29

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 29/4
x = 7.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the total number of slices.

Becky's slices = x + 3 = 7.25 + 3 = 10.25
Silvia's slices = 2x = 2 * 7.25 = 14.5

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10.25 + 7.25 + 14.5
Total slices = 31.75

However, since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: 31.75"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Donovan's part be represented as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the various charges incurred. 

First, we have the cost of the cast, which is a fixed amount of $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the visit, which is calculated as $300 per hour multiplied by the duration of the visit, which is 0.5 hours (since the visit is 30 minutes). This gives us $300 * 0.5 = $150.

We also need to account for the cost of painkillers, which is $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills. Therefore, the total cost of painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, there's the cost of parking, which is $6 per hour, and the visit requires a minimum of 2 hours of parking. So, the total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the number of emails that require a response first. 

We know that 20% of the emails don't require a response. To find the number of emails that do require a response, we can calculate 80% of 80 emails. 

80% of 80 emails is 0.8 * 80 = 64 emails that require a response.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by the number of days in a work week (5) to find the total number of emails he responds to in a week.

64 * 5 = 320

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can break down the information as follows:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 x 32 = 64 classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 x 32 = 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

The scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, we add the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95

Therefore, the average score is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. Twice as many pizzas as the glee club is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we must first calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S.

The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost of mailing a big coupon is 15 cents. Therefore, the total cost of postage can be expressed as:

Total Cost = (S * 5) + (B * 15)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total Cost = (700 * 5) + (2 * 700 * 15)
Total Cost = 3500 + 21000
Total Cost = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
Total Cost = 245 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we must first calculate the initial number of sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which can be calculated as 10 - 3 = 7. 

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. 

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser. 

A quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched is 1/4 * 20 = 5. Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 * 20 = 100 tons.

The remaining trucks that could deliver the fertiliser are 20 - 5 = 15. The total amount of fertiliser delivered is then 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we must first calculate the total amount of butter required. Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, which equals 3. This indicates that Dennis will need to purchase 3 sets of the promotional offer.

Since each set costs $4.00, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people declined the invitation.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. To find the cost for the additional guests, we subtract the base number of guests from the total number of guests.

Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of x, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of x. The total amount they spent is 1/4x + 1/3x. We can set up the equation 2x - (1/4x + 1/3x) = 60.

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 1/4 and 1/3, which is 12. Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions: 24x - 3x - 4x = 720. Combine like terms: 17x = 720. Divide both sides by 17: x = 42.2.

Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had initially is 2x = 2 * 42.2 = 84.4.

Now, let's find the amount of money they have left. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 1/4 * 42.2 = 10.55. Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 1/3 * 42.2 = 14.07. The total amount they spent is 10.55 + 14.07 = 24.62. To find the amount of money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had: 84.4 - 24.62 = 59.78.

The two of them have $59.78 left."
"To determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey, we must first calculate the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and since there are 7 days in a week, the first monkey's weekly consumption is 10 * 7 = 70 bananas.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey's daily consumption is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas. The second monkey's weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 bananas.

The combined weekly consumption of the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey's weekly consumption is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

First, we calculate the number of pieces in the first half of the 500-piece puzzle: 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Next, we add the number of pieces in the second puzzle: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, if we assume she has enough money, we can calculate the change:
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses.

The correct answer is: She will leave 0 quarters."
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, we'll calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 * $5.50 = $33
Next, we'll calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 * $11 = $99
Lastly, we'll calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 * $1.50 = $30

Now, we'll add the total sales from each item: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to analyze the train schedule.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means the time from its arrival to departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. Since the third train leaves immediately after its arrival, its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can divide the total number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the watch, we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can set up the equation:

Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

Since the percentage discount is negative, it means the sale price is higher than the original price. However, the question asks for the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, which is the percentage decrease from the original price to the sale price. To find this, we can calculate the percentage decrease:

Percentage decrease = (Original price - Sale price) / Original price * 100
Percentage decrease = ($2666.67 - $3200) / $2666.67 * 100
Percentage decrease = -22.67%

The correct answer is 22.67%."
"To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to first determine the rate at which each spring produces jellyfish. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, it produces 60 jellyfish per hour (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second).

In 4 hours, a single spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 times the number created by one spring in 4 hours, which is 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 1200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To solve this problem, we can represent Binkie's score as 'x'. Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = Frankie's score

We are given that Binkie's score is 90, so we can substitute x = 90 into the equation:

2(90) + 15 = Frankie's score
180 + 15 = Frankie's score
195 = Frankie's score

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we must first calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of buying bananas individually is calculated as follows: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying bananas in bunches is $3.00 per bunch, and Jenny purchased 10 bunches, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as x. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam's share, we can find out how much is left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, Sam is left with 80 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. 

First, we establish the rate of growth per year, which is 8 inches divided by 4 years, resulting in a rate of 2 inches per year. 

Next, we multiply this rate by the total number of years, 13, to calculate the total growth. 

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, we can calculate this as:

Number of Trekking bikes = 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, we find the number of BMX bikes sold, which accounts for 15% of the total bikes sold:

Number of BMX bikes = 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:

Number of MTB bikes = 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

To calculate the total earnings, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its respective price and add the results:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500
= $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we must consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck operate.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. To find the net change in the number of bales per hour, we subtract the number of bales collected from the number of bales produced: 5 - 3 = 2.

Since the farmer and the truck work for 6 hours, we multiply the net change in bales per hour by the number of hours worked: 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

**The final answer is 12.**"
"To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we calculate the total minutes John spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we must first calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. 

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

Since the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, we can calculate the height after the first bounce by multiplying 72 by 2/3, which yields 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce. To find this, we multiply 48 by 2/3, resulting in 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we must first convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. Let's start with the Allosaurus, who ate 270 kilograms of the remaining meat. Since the Allosaurus ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, we can represent the amount left after the T-Rex ate as ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

Now, we need to find the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. Since the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms, the T-Rex must have eaten 540 + 270 = 810 kilograms.

To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount the velociraptors ate: 810 + 540 = 1350 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1350}$"
"To determine the total area of the walls, we must calculate the area of each wall and add them together. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, 3 sodas were shaken, and 1 unshaken soda was taken by Ellen. This leaves 2 shaken sodas. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (1) by the total number of outcomes (10) and multiply by 100:

(1/10) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we can use the formula: Distance = Rate x Time.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we can add their speeds to find their relative speed: 60 mph + 30 mph = 90 mph.

Now, we can multiply their relative speed by the time they have traveled (3 hours) to find the total distance between them: 90 mph * 3 hours = 270 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we must first calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. 

20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we round down to 6 days off.

Billy is available to volunteer for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to volunteer by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we must consider the capacity of both the buses and the cars. 

First, we calculate the total number of people in the buses. There are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people. Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the total number of people in the cars. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars. This gives us 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike with variables: J for Jeff, M for Martha, and M for Mike.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: J = M + 10
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: M = M - 4

We are also given that Mike is 24 years old: M = 24

We can substitute the value of M into the second equation to find Martha's age: M = 24 - 4 = 20

Now, we can substitute Martha's age into the first equation to find Jeff's age: J = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we first need to find the distance run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
= 3.5 * 8
= 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, we calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, we calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
$15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be:
$85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00
$70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."
"To determine Caroline's age, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

We are given that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We are also given that Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C = 2 * 4 = 8.

Lastly, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B = 3 * 8 = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary of $100,000, which is $20,000 per year. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

$20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save the same amount each year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for 20 years, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

However, we need to know how much she needs to save for 20 years. Assuming she wants to save the same amount each year, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need 20 years to save $400,000.

However, this is the amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount.

To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the annual increase in her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, her annual income will increase by 20% each year. 

Let's assume her annual income is x. Then, her annual income for the next year will be 1.2x.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

$20,000 = 0.2x

Solving for x, we get:

x = $100,000 / 0.2
x = $500,000

Since her annual income is $500,000, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $400,000.

$400,000 / $500,000 = 0.8

To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide 20 years by 0.8.

20 years / 0.8 = 25 years

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save $400,000, not the number of years she needs to work to save for 20 years. To find the correct answer, we need to find the number of years she needs to work to save 20 years' worth of expenses.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for 20 years to save 20 years' worth of expenses.

The correct answer is 20 years.

Final Answer: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This yields 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This calculation results in 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the concept of percentages. We know that 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this situation. If 40% of the total number of students is 240, we can express this as:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total number of students. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600, and the number of girls is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the soil is $26. Adding these two amounts together gives us $19 + $26 = $45. 

However, we need to account for the $7 discount. To do this, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

We have two groups of heels: 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. 

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.

The total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of women, which is 6.

18 / 6 = 3

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we can find the additional miles she needs to hike per day by subtracting 125 from 310.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To determine the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

The cost of red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.
The cost of blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.
The cost of green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

The total amount received is the sum of these individual costs: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we first need to calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre wants a quarter of the total, which is 1/4 of 12 kg. To find this, we can multiply 12 by 1/4, which is equivalent to 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of the total, which is 1/3 of 12 kg. To find this, we can multiply 12 by 1/3, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially was 12 kg, we can subtract the amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total to find the amount left for Jacques. 

12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we must consider the changes in temperature over the specified period. 

The temperature initially was 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight, resulting in a temperature of 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. 

In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the temperature in the morning can be calculated as follows:

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Drop in temperature + Increase in temperature
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we need to consider the sequence of events that affected his initial $21.

First, he saved $11 from his allowance, increasing his total to $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book, reducing his total to $32 - $5 = $27.

Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, resulting in a final total of $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

$8"
"To determine the cost of each book, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the books. Anna's initial budget was $16, and she had $2 left after making the purchase. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent ($14) by 2.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

Therefore, each book cost $7.

The final answer is $7."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled this year, we need to find 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 can be calculated as 0.20 x 50 = 10.

The total number of students this year is the original number (50) plus the increase (10), which equals 60.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. 

Let's denote the unknown time as 'x'. We know that 255 blinks occur in 5 minutes. We can set up the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

255x = 459 * 5

Simplifying, we get:

255x = 2295

Dividing both sides by 255, we get:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9.05 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is 9.05."
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fish, we must first calculate the total number of each type of fish.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquired 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6.
The total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.
The total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5.
The total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11.
The total number of female fish is 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, we subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia's time to mow the lawn is given as 4 hours. 

Megan's time to walk the dog is 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior's time to do laundry is over 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To determine the total distance driven in a month, we must first calculate the round-trip distance. The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can set up a proportion based on the information provided. Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as x. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can express this relationship as:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance
10 * 7 = 2x
70 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 70 / 2
x = 35

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as x. Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 10x.

The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 200 + 10x. Since the total number of toys needed is 220, we can set up the equation:

200 + 10x = 220

Subtracting 200 from both sides gives us:

10x = 20

Dividing both sides by 10 gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. 

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Luis received x/2 stickers. After giving half to Luis, Seth was left with x - x/2 = x/2 stickers.

Luis then gave half of his stickers to Kris, so Kris received (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. We know Kris kept 9 stickers, so we can set up the equation x/4 = 9.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, resulting in x = 36.

Therefore, Seth initially had 36 stickers.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of M&M's John has, we must first calculate the total weight of the M&M's in the large bags. Since each bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can calculate the total number of M&M's as follows:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find the number of small bags John can make with 900 M&M's, given that each small bag contains 10 M&M's. To do this, we can divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

900 M&M's ÷ 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we must first calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Next, we divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we can use the given information to set up a ratio. Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C.

We know that B = 5A and C = 1.25B. We also know that A = 120 Miles per hour.

First, we can find the speed of the 2nd fastest car by multiplying the speed of the average car by 5: B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Next, we can find the speed of the faster car by multiplying the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent Vince's current age as 'x'. Since Liam's age is twice Vince's age two years ago, we can set up the equation:

Liam's current age = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

We know Liam is 16 years old now, so we can substitute 16 for his current age:

16 = 2 * (x - 2)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:

8 = x - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate x:

x = 10

Therefore, Vince's current age is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M, so we can write this as an equation: A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This gives us two equations:

C + S = 30 ... (Equation 1)
C = S + 12 ... (Equation 2)

We can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for S:

(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into Equation 2:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get:

A + A + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
2A + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2A = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
A = 13

Now that we know A, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately.

First, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:

Weight of crayons in pounds = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 ounces / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the total length of wood that can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs from 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, the number of logs John can make is:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we determine the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5, as each log is cut into 5 planks.
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the selling price of each plank, which is $1.2.
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John's total earnings are $96."
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can represent her brother's salary as 2x. Therefore, Valerie's salary is x. We know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, so we can set up the equation:

x = $5000

To find the value of x, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by $5000:

x = $5000 / $5000
x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the brother's salary by multiplying x by 2:

Brother's salary = 2x
Brother's salary = 2 * $5000
Brother's salary = $10,000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we need to find their combined salary first. Valerie's salary is $5000 and her brother's salary is $10,000, so their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start by finding the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 40 minutes is spent on the beach. 

Time = Distance / Speed
We don't know the speed, but we know that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach. Let's call the speed on the beach 'x'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

We know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We also know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 3 miles:

40 + 30/x = total time

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by x:

40x + 30 = x * total time

Since the total time is equal to the time it takes to walk 3 miles, we can set up an equation:

40x + 30 = 3x

Subtract 40x from both sides:

30 = -37x

Divide both sides by -37:

x = -30/37

Since speed cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. We need to re-examine our previous steps.

Since speed cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. We need to re-examine our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk. We know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We also know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 3 miles:

40 + 30/x = total time

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by x:

40x + 30 = x * total time

Since the total time is equal to the time it takes to walk 3 miles, we can set up an equation:

40x + 30 = 3x

Subtract 40x from both sides:

30 = -37x

Divide both sides by -37:

x = -30/37

Since speed cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. We need to re-examine our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk. We know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We also know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 3 miles:

40 + 30/x = total time

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by x:

40x + 30 ="
"To determine the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of additional weeks as 'x'. Since she saves $4 per week, the total amount she will have saved after 'x' weeks is $4x.

We know that the total amount she wants to save is $60, so we can set up the equation:

$4x = $60

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by $4:

x = $60 ÷ $4
x = 15

Therefore, it will take Jane 15 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. This gives us a total of 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, contributing a total of 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

Lastly, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add these totals together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of marbles Bob has initially as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, the equation can be set up as:

x + 24 = 60

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce.

We can set up the equation:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 5:

4 * 33 + x = 200

Expanding the left side:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we must calculate the cumulative additions of cows and chickens over the specified period.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Each day, 20 cows and 10 chickens are added. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we can calculate the total additions as follows:

Cows: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Chickens: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total additions:

Total cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is:

Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Next, we calculate the discount amount by finding 10% of the total cost:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell pays:

Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel:

Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

Therefore, the cost of each bagel after the discount is $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let's say x represents the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, and y represents the number of potatoes needed for each scoop.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes: x = 23 - 5
x = 18

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can represent this as a ratio: 6 - 3 = 3 scoops, and 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. This means that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops. We can write this as a ratio: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops.

Now, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of scoops to the number of potatoes:

(3 potatoes / 2 scoops) = (y potatoes / x scoops)

We know that x = 18 scoops, so we can substitute this value into the proportion:

(3 potatoes / 2 scoops) = (y potatoes / 18 scoops)

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 18 = 2y
54 = 2y

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to find y:

y = 54 / 2
y = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester's egg consumption can be calculated by multiplying the number of days (30) by the daily egg consumption (3 eggs). This gives us 30 * 3 = 90 eggs.

For the next 30 days, we multiply the number of days (30) by the increased daily egg consumption (5 eggs), resulting in 30 * 5 = 150 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days, we add the eggs from the first 30 days (90) to the eggs from the next 30 days (150), giving us a total of 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can find the number of dozens of eggs needed by dividing the total number of eggs (240) by 12. This calculation yields 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 x 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we can use the formula:

Total lemons = Number of trees × Number of lemons per tree × Number of years

Given:
Number of trees = 5
Number of lemons per tree = 6
Number of years = 10

Total lemons = 5 × 6 × 10
Total lemons = 300

Therefore, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is 300."
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the number of men is 5 parts, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 84

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 16.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16.8 to 16 (as you can't have 0.8 of a person). 

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 16 = 80. 

The number of women is 9x = 9 * 16 = 144, but we know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation:

9x + 5x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now we know that the number of women is 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold as 'x'. Since each sunflower costs $2, the total revenue from sunflowers is 2x. We know that Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 26

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 26/2
x = 13

This means Faraday sold 13 sunflowers.

However, we also know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets. Since Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets is 7 * 12 = 84.

The total number of sunflowers sold is the sum of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquets. Since we already know that 13 sunflowers were sold individually, the total number of sunflowers sold is 13 + 84 = 97.

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Next, we need to find 60% of the total cost, which represents the amount he spends on rocks. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.6:
$500 * 0.6 = $300

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory. He sells 60% of 100 rocks, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount he earns is:
60 * 7 = $420

Finally, we can calculate the amount of money he loses by subtracting the total amount he spends from the total amount he earns:
$500 - $420 = $80

Therefore, Adam loses $80."
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 5, 6, and 7 is 210. 

Now, we can divide the total number of each type of scene by the LCM to find the number of days required for each type of scene:

45 large-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.2143 (round up to 1 day, since we can't have a fraction of a day)
36 medium-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.1714 (round up to 1 day)
49 small-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.2336 (round up to 1 day)

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up the number of days for each type of scene. However, we can see that the LCM is not the correct answer. We need to find the maximum number of days required for any type of scene.

The maximum number of days required is 9 days for large-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we must divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

There are 4 children. 

Dividing the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) yields 36 ÷ 4 = 9 eggs per child.

The correct answer is 9."
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we must first calculate the daily cost of food for all three fish. Each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, so the total daily cost is:

3 fish * $1/day = $3/day

Since May has 31 days, we can multiply the daily cost by the number of days to find the total monthly cost:

$3/day * 31 days = $93

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we must consider the sequence of events that have transpired.

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She then gave 24 roses to her mother, which results in a reduction of 24 roses. This can be expressed as 30 - 24 = 6.

Following this, Patricia acquired 15 additional roses, which increases the total by 15. Therefore, we add 15 to the result from the previous step: 6 + 15 = 21.

Thus, Patricia now possesses 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial distance and the additional distance, which is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial time and the additional time, which is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. Therefore, the average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"When two independent events are involved, the probability of both occurring is found by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event. In this case, we have two independent events: the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning (since it's three times more likely to win).

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:

0.2 (first ticket) * 0.6 (second ticket) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the number of seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can express the number of seashells Carlos collected as 2x. 

We are also given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as the equation:

2x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 22

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected:

2x = 2(11) = 22

We can now find the total number of seashells by adding the number of seashells each person collected:

Total seashells = 11 (Carrey) + 22 (Carlos) + 27 (Jim) = 60

Since the seashells are divided equally among the three people, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we must consider the carrots he consumes on weekdays and the weekend.

Mason's daily carrot intake on weekdays is 4 carrots, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On the weekend, Mason consumes 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, resulting in a total of 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find the total weekly carrot consumption, we add the weekday and weekend carrot intake: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we must first calculate the length of the second song. Since it is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is $40, and the cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is $80. Therefore, the total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

Since Linus sells each device for twice the cost, the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40. With 6 devices sold, the total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit earned by Linus is $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, making him 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet. 

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

However, this represents 100% of the energy demand for 2300 people. To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet this demand, we can simply use the total energy demand as the answer.

The final answer is 460."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups. 

Let's denote the total number of babies as 8. The number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 of 8, which is 6. The number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 of 8, which is 2. 

The number of babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers (6) plus the number of blue wearers (2), which equals 4.

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated by considering the number of purple bow wearers and the total number of bow wearers.

The number of purple bow wearers is 1/3 of 6, which is 2. 

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is then 2 out of the total number of bow wearers, which is 4. 

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 2 / 4
= 1/2
= 0.5
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize a straightforward approach. 

Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, Thursday as Th, and Friday as F. We are given the following information:

M + T = 1907
Th + F = 2136
Total reports received = M + T + W + Th + F = 5168

We can start by adding the first two equations:
M + T + Th + F = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we can subtract this sum from the total number of reports received:
5168 - (M + T + Th + F) = 5168 - 4043
W = 5168 - 4043
W = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50. This leaves him with 80 - 40 = 40 square meters.

He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. To find 1/4 of 40, we can multiply 40 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 40 by 4. 40 / 4 = 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount he earns from this sale, we multiply the number of square meters by the price per square meter: 30 * 3 = $90.

Abraham initially earned $50 from the first sale and $30 from the second sale. He then earned an additional $90 from the last sale. In total, he earned $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the relationship between Geb's and Haley's ages. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G.

We are given that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, so we can write an equation:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are also given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we must first calculate his daily usage. Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can multiply these two values to find the total daily usage.

Daily usage = 2 face masks/day * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2.

Total usage every 2 days = 6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up the total number of eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we convert 3 dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Let's break it down step by step:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 times the amount from Year 2, so 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 times the amount from Year 3, so 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 times the amount from Year 4, so 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 times the amount from Year 5, so 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 times the amount from Year 6 minus 200, so 10 * 7350 - 200 = 73500 - 200 = 73400 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 73400 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of the initial $100 that Sophia gave him.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 

When added to the initial $100, the total becomes $100 + $20 = $120.

The final amount Jack has is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this relationship as an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be written as:
R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, she was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x - (1/5)(3x) = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - 3x/5 = 12x/5

Combine like terms:

(15x - 3x)/5 = 12x/5

Simplify further:

12x/5 = 12x/5

Now, we can see that the equation is an identity, which means that the initial assumption that Rissa gave 1/5 of her money to her sister is not correct. However, we can still find the value of x.

Since Rissa was given 3x dollars and she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up another equation:

3x - (1/5)(3x) = (4/5)(3x)

This equation is the same as the previous one, which means that the initial assumption is correct. Let's try a different approach.

Let's say Rissa gave y dollars to her sister. Then, Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars. Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtract 12x from both sides:

3x - 5y = 0

Add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Divide both sides by 3:

x = (5/3)y

Now, we know that Rissa was given 3x dollars. Since she gave y dollars to her sister, she is left with 3x - y dollars. We are given that she is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Substitute x = (5/3)y:

3((5/3)y) - y = (4/5)(3((5/3)y))

Simplify the equation:

5y - y = (4/5)(5y)

Combine like terms:

4y = 4y

This equation is an identity, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we still need to find the value of y.

Since Rissa was given 3x dollars and she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

3x = 3y

Divide both sides by 3:

x = y

Now that we know x = y, we can find the value of x. Since Rissa was given 3x dollars, we can substitute x = y into the equation:

3x = 3y

Substitute x = y:

3y = 3y

This equation is an identity, which means that we need to use a different approach.

Let's go back to the original equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Substitute x = y:

3y - y = (4/5)(3y)

Combine like terms:

2y = 12y/5

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

10y = 12y

Subtract 10y from both sides:

0 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

0 = y

This means that y = 0, which is not possible since Rissa gave some amount of money to her sister. However, we can try to find the value of x.

Since Rissa was given 3x dollars and she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

Subtract 12x from both sides:

3x = 0

x = 0

This means that x = 0, which is not possible since Ronnie was given some amount of money. However, we can try to find the value of x.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the amount of each color paint be represented by a variable, say 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

Now, we know that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors. So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each room. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. 

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can utilize the concept of a geometric sequence. The number of clouds doubles each day, which indicates a common ratio of 2. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3 (the initial number of clouds on Monday), r = 2 (the common ratio), and n = 5 (the number of days). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we need to first calculate the cost of one pod in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

The cost of one pod in the new box is $12 / 120 = $0.10.

Now, we can find the number of cycles we can run with $1 by dividing $1 by the cost of one pod:

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as x. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, the number of goals scored by team B in the first half is x - 2.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored x - 2 goals in the first half, team A scores (1/4)(x - 2) goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4(x - 2) goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: x (first half) + (1/4)(x - 2) (second half) = (5/4)x - 1
Team B: (x - 2) (first half) + 4(x - 2) (second half) = 5x - 10

Since the total number of goals scored by both teams is the sum of their individual scores, we can set up the equation:

(5/4)x - 1 + 5x - 10 = total goals

Combine like terms:

(9/4)x - 11 = total goals

To find the total number of goals, we need to know the value of x. However, we can express the total goals in terms of x.

The total number of goals scored in the match is (9/4)x - 11.

However, we can also express the total goals in terms of the number of goals scored by team B in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, we can write x = (2 + 2) = 4. 

Substituting x = 4 into the equation for the total goals, we get:

(9/4)(4) - 11 = 9 - 11 = -2

However, this is not a valid answer since the number of goals cannot be negative. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that team A scores 4 goals in the first half and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is (1/4)(2) = 0.5 goals. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4(2) = 8 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is 14.5."
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can start by finding the amount of chalk used on Monday. 

45% of the 5-inch piece of chalk is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day. Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

0.20 * (2.25 - 0.20x) = 0.45

Simplifying the equation:

0.45 - 0.04x = 0.45

Subtracting 0.45 from both sides:

-0.04x = 0

Dividing both sides by -0.04:

x = 5

Therefore, the teacher will have 5 days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we must first calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

The number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, thrice that amount would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we add 2 to this result to find the total number of face masks Johnny bought. Therefore, 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and divide it by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 11 teeth (7 more than the number drilled). 

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15

Total number of teeth James has = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the amount of milk Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

First, we can convert the fraction 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4. 

Now, we multiply 0.4 by 4000 gallons: 0.4 * 4000 = 1600 gallons.

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let W represent Wendy's current age and C represent Colin's current age. From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute W = 5C + 35 into the second equation to get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

Next, we divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get: 54 sets ÷ 3 = 18 sets per school.

Since each set contains 100 books, we multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books each school can get: 18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school.

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps. 

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he put 6 apples in his pocket and threw 1 apple back into the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

The final answer is 13."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we must first calculate the number of 50 kg bags in the 850 kg shipment. This can be achieved by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg).

850 kg ÷ 50 kg = 17

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

17 bags × $18 per bag = $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each friend consumes. Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

With 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 

60 slices / 12 slices per cheese pizza = 5
60 slices / 8 slices per pepperoni pizza = 7.5

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can break down the information into two parts: the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Let's calculate the total miles for each part:

- Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles
- Miles on Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from both parts to find the total miles Sam ran this week: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of net change. Let's denote the time it takes Jay to build 60 snowballs as 't' hours.

Since Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, his net gain per hour is 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

We can set up the equation: 18t = 60

To solve for 't', we can divide both sides by 18:

t = 60 / 18
t = 10/3
t = 3.33 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is 3.33."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent John's age as J and Jim's age as x. We are given that John is twice as old as Jim, so we can write the equation:

J = 2x

We are also given that John's current age is 28, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, Jim's age is 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can analyze the information provided. 

Doxa initially sliced the apple into 8 pieces. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, and her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Then, her sister ate x + 1 slices, and her brother ate (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2 slices.

Since the total number of slices is 8, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 8

Combine like terms: 3x + 3 = 8

Subtract 3 from both sides: 3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 15 = 63.

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the length of her hair and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

First, we calculate the total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 7.5 hours a day, we can multiply the number of hours she works per day by the number of days she works per week and then by the number of weeks in April.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate. We multiply the total hours worked by her hourly rate of $1.5.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Therefore, we add this amount to her total earnings from her hourly rate.

Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to consider the amount he earned from each activity and then sum them up.

Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

For the dishwasher, he emptied it 6 times, so the total amount earned from this activity is 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

He also did his laundry once, which earned him $3.00.

Additionally, he took the trash out twice, resulting in 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.

Lastly, he cleaned his room once, earning him $1.50.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

Therefore, Jason's total earnings for the two-week period are $8.00."
"To calculate the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we must first determine the amount of blood a single shark possesses. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the shark's blood by multiplying 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Next, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have.

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups.

First, we have the initial 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, bringing the total to 50 + 40 = 90.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290.

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we must first calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since each pack contains 5 pens, and Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it is 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red pens and black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the quantity.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then, on the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, resulting in 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining. The next day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. Finally, on the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, leaving 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

To find the amount each person received, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve the equation 4x + 8 = 40, we can start by subtracting 8 from both sides:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to determine one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 can be calculated as 66 ÷ 3 = 22.

This means that 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 can be calculated as (5/11) × 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to break down the information provided.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, adding 3 * 6 = 18 colors to her collection.

Combining these, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister then stole one palette, which contained 4 colors. This reduces Amy's total to 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Lastly, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors, leaving her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second floor. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we must first determine the total weight of the tunas caught. This can be achieved by adding the weights of the three tunas: 56 kilograms + 46 kilograms + 26 kilograms = 128 kilograms.

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram, which is $0.50. This results in a total of 128 * 0.50 = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we must first calculate the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. Given that the cost price is $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has 2 classes.

First, we'll find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity: 1/8 * 120 = 15

Since John has 2 classes, we'll multiply the result by 2: 15 * 2 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial loan amount of $300. 

The interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02. 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
= $300 * 0.02 * 1 (since the interest is for 1 year)
= $6

The monthly payment for 11 months is $25. To find the total amount paid in 11 months, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
= $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month:

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the volume of the jar. Given its square base and height, the volume can be calculated as the area of the base multiplied by the height. The area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches yields a volume of 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we must divide the volume by 0.8 to account for this. This results in 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Next, we must consider that 30% of the jelly beans are red. To find the number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3, which gives us 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{697.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop boarded the bus. This is equivalent to (3/4) * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing 60, we get 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to consider the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated by multiplying the number of tables by the cost per table: 4 * $20 = $80.

The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated by multiplying the number of roof frames by the cost per frame: 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we can start by establishing the ratio of meatballs to pounds of meat. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can express this as a ratio: 16 meatballs : 1 pound.

We are given that Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. To find the number of pounds of meat needed, we can set up a proportion using the ratio:

16 meatballs : 1 pound = 80 meatballs : x pounds

Cross-multiplying, we get:

16x = 80

Dividing both sides by 16, we find:

x = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the amount of seasoning required. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must first calculate the total width of the windows. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * 0.25 = $4.00.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * 0.20 = $4.00.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we must first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Next, we add 1 more inch to this amount, resulting in a total of 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of cupcakes be represented as 'x'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets two treats. So, the total number of cupcakes and brownies is 10. We can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to find the combined price of both services. 

The basic manicure starts at $35, and the basic pedicure starts at $40. To find the combined price, we add these two amounts: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we need to calculate the discount for getting both services. The discount is 20% of the combined price. To find 20% of $75, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which equals $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the combined price to find the discounted price: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

To find the total cost, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

First, we'll calculate the total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues each. This can be done by multiplying 3 by 12, which equals 36.

Next, we'll calculate the number of issues from the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year. This is a straightforward calculation, resulting in 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. To find this, we multiply 6 by 4, which equals 24.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x, the number of paintings Shelley has as y, and the number of paintings Samantha has as z.

We are given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can write the equation:

z = y - 12

We are also given that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can write another equation:

y = x + 8

Finally, we are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write the third equation:

z = 27

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:

y - 12 = 27

Adding 12 to both sides, we get:

y = 39

Now, substituting the value of y into the second equation, we get:

39 = x + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is 31."
"To calculate the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we calculate the price after the 80% increase in December:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount earned from the standard lessons is:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25%, which is equivalent to subtracting 25% of $80 from the standard rate. This can be calculated as:

$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount earned from the lessons with veterans:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the total amount earned from the standard lessons and the total amount earned from the lessons with veterans to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total score by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of pomelos she gave away as x. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can express this as:

20 - x = 1/4 * 20

To solve for x, we can first simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

20 - x = 5

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we can calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Walter ate 24 apples, so the remaining number of apples is:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

The remaining number of apples is:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each:
27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of novels written this year as x. Since 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year, we can write the equation:

3/4 * x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To calculate the distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he is traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that the mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

We also know that Madeline and her brother used a total of 36 grapes. 

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total number of grapes used by the family is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother, and the grapes used by the mother. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 6 - 30 = 48

Combine like terms:

x - 36 = 48

Add 36 to both sides:

x = 84

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

The number of sick teachers is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. 

Let's perform the addition: 13 + 9 = 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at the school that day is 22."
"To determine the total amount Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 52.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. 

The total weekly cost is the sum of the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning. 

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. Therefore, the total time spent cleaning is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning (20 hours) by the total hours worked (8 hours) and multiply by 100: (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 / 45 = 2.44

To accommodate all the books, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we must first determine the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs. To find the total selling price, we multiply the number of eggs by the selling price per egg: 60 * $1 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price: $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since half of 100 hats is 50, we can subtract this from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining hats, which are blue. To do this, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which gives us (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as 'x'. 

We know that she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, which is 70% of (70 + 40) questions. 

The equation can be set up as follows: 
0.7 * (70 + 40) + 42 = 77

First, calculate the total number of questions: 
70 + 40 = 110

Now, multiply 0.7 by 110: 
0.7 * 110 = 77

Now, we have: 
77 + 42 = 119

However, we know that she already got 42 questions correct on the first test. We need to find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test. So, we subtract 42 from 77:
77 - 42 = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the number of strawberry cubes. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can express the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can use the formula for multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of games played per year (40) by the number of years (4), which gives us 40 * 4 = 160. 

Next, we multiply the result by the number of points scored per game (21), which gives us 160 * 21 = 3360.

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which means he lost 5 marbles. This leaves him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

However, he then found 3 more marbles, bringing his total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

Finally, he discovered a non-marble object, which doesn't affect the count of marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to break down the information into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, the total number of flashlights is 4 x 2 = 8.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16.
The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the number of chips each person receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips. Since Mitchell purchases two bags, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find the number of chips each person receives.

110 ÷ 5 = 22

Therefore, each person receives 22 chips."
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to break down the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that there are half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
= 20 / 2
= 10

Next, we know that there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
= 40

Now that we have the number of robots, helmets, and footballs, we can find the total number of items by adding them together:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
= 10 + 20 + 40
= 70

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to calculate the number of calls he handles in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

First, we find the number of calls he handles in an hour by dividing the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes to handle a call (15 minutes).

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Since Tim works 6 hours a day, we can multiply the number of calls he handles per hour by the number of hours he works per day.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

As Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls he handles per day by the number of days he works per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must first identify the number of plants in each category and their corresponding water requirements.

We know that 4 plants require half a cup of water, which can be expressed as 0.5 cups. Multiplying this by the number of plants yields 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we are informed that 8 plants require 1 cup of water. Multiplying this by the number of plants gives us 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants require a quarter of a cup of water, which can be expressed as 0.25 cups. Multiplying this by the number of plants yields 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water required by adding the amounts for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the time spent hopping on land and swimming through water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time for each segment separately.

The total distance is 200 yards, with 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. 

The time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards divided by the land speed of 20 yards per minute, which equals 5 minutes.

The time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards divided by the water speed of 10 yards per minute, which equals 10 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of the land and water times, which is 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we must first calculate the number of boxes required. We can do this by dividing the total number of sticks needed (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we must first establish the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Given that the main phone costs $20, we can deduce that each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

With four additional phones, the total cost for these phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones, we get $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is $60."
"To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we must first determine the daily production of doughnuts. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, Derrick produces 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in June, which is 30. This yields 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Finally, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the selling price per doughnut, which is $2. Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are 3600 * 2 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To determine the number of days required to upload all the photos, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Therefore, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To determine the total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning, we must calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00.

Finally, we add the costs together: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

The final answer is: $47"
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Next, we need to find John's new speaking speed in words per minute. His original speed is 150 words per minute, and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute by dividing the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that on the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, resulting in 70 people. Then, on the third day, the total number of people doubled to 140.

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these four days, we can multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals of 30 seconds each.

In the first interval, 20 kernels pop.

In the second interval, the popping rate increases three times the initial rate, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the third interval, the popping rate increases four times the initial rate, resulting in 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the fourth interval, the popping rate decreases to half the rate of the previous interval, resulting in 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, we can calculate the total number of kernels popped by summing the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final interval also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is 210."
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first establish the ratio of lemons to gallons. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, and 1 gallon requires 1 cup, the ratio is 6 lemons per gallon.

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons needed is:
6 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

To create an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need half the amount of juice, which is 1/2 cup. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, the number of lemons required for the extra gallon is:
6 lemons/cup * 1/2 cup = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption of both breeds. 

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 dogs. Therefore, the total daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 dogs. Therefore, the total daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

To find the total daily consumption, we add the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we must first calculate the total number of legs. 

We have 10 two-legged animals, which contribute 10 * 2 = 20 legs, and 15 four-legged animals, which contribute 15 * 4 = 60 legs. 

The total number of legs is 20 + 60 = 80 legs. 

Since each pair consists of two legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to obtain the total number of pairs. 

80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks is 32, and the number of blue blocks is 4, while the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blocks can be represented by the equation: 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + r = 32.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: r = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours and then turned around to travel east for 8 hours, we can consider the two parts of the journey as two separate displacements.

The distance traveled west is 18 miles per hour * 5 hours = 90 miles.

The distance traveled east is 18 miles per hour * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since the two displacements are in opposite directions, we can find the net displacement by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.

Net displacement = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to apply the depreciation rates to the initial value.

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for each year:

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years.

Final Answer: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies, we must first calculate the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to find the cost of the bus trips first. Since each bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, we can calculate the cost of one bus trip as follows:

Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
= 0.1 x $80
= $8

Now, we can find the total cost of the bus trips by multiplying the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips:
Total cost of bus trips = $8 x 7
= $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

The final answer is: $136"
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

We know that Dallas initially had 25 marbles (since 21 + 4 = 25) and that the total number of marbles given by Mazie is 52. 

Let's denote the number of marbles given to Darla as 'x'. Since the total number of marbles given is 52, we can set up the equation: 25 + x = 52.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: x = 52 - 25.

x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is 27."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets can be determined by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost of an adult ticket, and then adding the cost of a child ticket. In this case, the calculation is as follows:

2 adult tickets * $12 = $24
$24 + $8 (child ticket) = $32

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost of each popcorn:

2 popcorns * $3 = $6

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to determine the total cost:

$32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the total length of crepe paper needed, we must calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma and Mia is 40 years old, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the sum of the seashells found by each individual. 

We add the seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from this total: 732 - 67 = 665.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665.

The final answer is: 665"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we must calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

The cost of the dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.
The cost of the bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.
The cost of the salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00."
"To determine the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we first need to calculate half of Steve's time. 

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we add 2 hours to this half to find Anna's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption. 

There are 5 pigs, each consuming 4 pounds of feed twice a day. The total daily feed consumption is calculated as follows:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find the amount left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must first calculate her total earnings from the sale of cupcakes and cookies. 

The total income from cupcakes is 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake, which equals $40. Additionally, she earns $40 from selling 40 cookies at $1 each. Therefore, her total income is $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the trays. Since Frances purchases five trays at $4 each, the total cost is 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple yet effective approach. We start with the initial number of children, which is 5. 

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, effectively doubling the number of children. This can be represented as 5 * 2 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, which can be calculated as 10 * 2 = 20. However, we must also account for the original 5 children who are still following the truck. Therefore, the total number of children on the third street is 20 + 5 = 25.

The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 25 - 5 = 20.

However, we must also account for the 5 children who left the group on the third street. Therefore, the final total is 20 + 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck."
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we must first calculate the total number of meals she has already given out. 

We can do this by adding the meals given out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 64 + 30 + 48 = 142.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial total to find the number of meals left: 1,360 - 142 = 1,218.

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents. Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents. Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

Therefore, James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 12 by 2.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16.

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 

12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break it down into two components: daily meditation and weekly yoga practice.

First, let's calculate the daily time spent on meditation. Since Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, the total daily time spent on meditation is 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the weekly time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total weekly time spent on yoga is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

Now, let's convert the daily meditation time to hours: 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours.

The total weekly time spent on meditation is 0.5 hours * 7 days = 3.5 hours.

Now, we can add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
3.5 hours (meditation) + 5 hours (yoga) = 8.5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8.5}$"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we must calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

First, we calculate the area of the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.

Finally, we calculate the area of the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Therefore, the quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{101}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we must first calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. Therefore, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information. We know that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. This implies that Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.

Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate her pens by dividing Timothy's pens by 2. Therefore, Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x.

We know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her current height is x + 3. We also know that she is 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. Since Albert is 36"" tall, we can represent Anne's height as 2 * 36 = 72"". Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 72 - 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 3 = 70

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

x = 67

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 67""."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. In two weeks (14 days), it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The price per bar is $2. Therefore, the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to break down the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine Ryan's total earnings, we can multiply the weekly allowance by the number of weeks he completed his chores. 

Weekly allowance: $6
Number of weeks: 3
Total earnings: $6 * 3 = $18

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Since Ryan bought cones for himself and 3 friends, the total number of cones is 4. The cost per cone is $1.25, so the total cost is:
4 * $1.25 = $5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings:
$18 - $5 = $13

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of each ticket:
$13 ÷ $6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and her sister, we need to calculate the individual totals and then add them together.

Ellen's purchases include a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. The total amount spent by Ellen is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani's purchases consist of a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total amount spent on the bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

The combined total spent by both Ellen and Lani is $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To determine the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing 10 jars. 

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit per jar is 2 * $6 = $12. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $12 = $120. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit per jar is 1.5 * $8 = $12. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $12 = $120. 

The cost of 2 pounds of honey per jar is 2 * $10 = $20. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $20 = $200. 

The total cost of producing 10 jars is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. 

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin to its equivalent value in dollars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to consider the sequence of events that affected his cookie count.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He then consumed 3 cookies, one of each flavor, leaving him with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Next, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, reducing his count to:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

After that, he gave away 2 sugar cookies, resulting in:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding to his count:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has:

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn, we must first divide his collection into two equal halves. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, each half will consist of 6 toys.

The first half, consisting of 6 toys at $5 each, can be calculated as 6 * 5 = $30.

The second half, also consisting of 6 toys at $7 each, can be calculated as 6 * 7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we must first calculate the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies. 

Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

The sum of these two types of cookies is 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get: B = 5.

However, we know that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. This means that the number of beakers he had is 7. 

Since the total number of beakers he should have had is 7, and he actually had 5, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we must first calculate the total number of screws required. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we can calculate the total screws needed as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables * Number of legs per table * Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2
Total screws needed = 32

Now, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws James has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2, as it is stated that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket.

Number of eggs in the first basket = 10

Total number of eggs in both baskets = 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the amount Kim raised. We know Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. So, Kim's amount can be calculated as $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, we find Maryam's amount. We know Sarah raised $300, and Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. So, Maryam's amount can be calculated as $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we have the amounts for all four individuals: Alexandra ($430), Kim ($750), Maryam ($700), and Sarah ($300). To find the total amount, we add these amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed and distance. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as:

A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice the distance Aaron ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as D. Then, we can express this as:

D = 4/2
D = 2

Now, we know that Aaron's time is 16 minutes, and his speed is 2V. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

16 = 2V / 2
16 = V

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time by multiplying her speed by the distance she ran:

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64

The final answer is 64."
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we must first calculate the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply 200 by 3 to find the total length of line required.

200 * 3 = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to purchase, we must subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To calculate the weekly revenue, we need to consider the number of meals and the cost of the meals, as well as the cost of the wine.

First, let's calculate the total cost of meals per day:
6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
12 meals * $5 per meal = $60

Adding the cost of the wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:
$65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per watermelon and then add a 25% profit.

First, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60. This is the cost per watermelon.

Next, we calculate the profit: 25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40.

Finally, we add the profit to the cost per watermelon: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Let's denote John's current age as J, James' current age as S, and Dora's current age as D. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, so we can write an equation:

S = 2D

We also know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

S = 2(9)
S = 18

Now, we know James' current age is 18. We also know that James was born when John was 19, so we can write another equation:

S = J - 19
18 = J - 19

Solving for J, we get:

J = 18 + 19
J = 37

Now, we know John's current age is 37. We also know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so we can write another equation:

Youngest son's current age = J - 32
Youngest son's current age = 37 - 32
Youngest son's current age = 5

To find the youngest son's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

Youngest son's age in 3 years = 5 + 3
Youngest son's age in 3 years = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges.

We can continue this pattern, and we can see that Ana will peel x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Jane will peel x, x, x, x, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each subsequent minute.

Let's calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Ana will peel x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + ... + 1 oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of 1, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + 1)
Sum = 30 * (x + 1)

Jane will peel x + x + x + ... + x oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of x, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + x)
Sum = 30 * 2x
Sum = 60x

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Difference = 30 * (x + 1) - 60x
= 30x + 30 - 60x
= -30x + 30

Since x is the number of oranges peeled in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference -30x + 30 is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: $0$"
"To calculate the cost of the new radiator, we need to find 80% of the original price of $400. 

80% of $400 can be calculated as 0.8 * $400 = $320. 

Now, we subtract this amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the labor cost by multiplying the number of hours (3) by the hourly rate ($50): 3 * $50 = $150.

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to get the total amount Mark paid: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's represent the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 4 and subtracting the second equation from it:

4x + 4y = 80
2x + 4y = 70
-------------------
2x = 10
x = 5

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of y:

5 + y = 20
y = 15

So, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we must first calculate the total number of slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4. This results in 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices."
