"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as follows: 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fiber together: 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

The number of sprints per week is 3, and the number of meters per sprint is 60. 

Total meters per week = 3 * 60 = 180

So, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

The morning feed is 15 cups, and the afternoon feed is 25 cups. 

First, we add these two amounts together: 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total daily feed needed.

40 cups * 20 chickens = 800 cups

Since Wendi has already given the chickens 40 cups of feed, we subtract this from the total daily feed to find the amount needed for the final meal.

800 cups - 40 cups = 760 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{760}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow the given information.

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This takes 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download takes 20 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 80 minutes (second download) = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. We can calculate the distance he traveled during this time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. This doesn't change his distance from home.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. We can calculate the distance he traveled during this time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. We can calculate the distance he traveled during this time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, we add up the distances he traveled during each segment to find the total distance he is from home:

Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160
Total distance = 355 miles

So, John is 355 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is 355."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to multiply the regular hourly rate by 1.2 to get the overtime rate, then multiply by the number of overtime hours. 
First, we multiply the regular hourly rate by 1.2: 
$10 * 1.2 = $12
Then, we multiply the overtime rate by the number of overtime hours:
$12 * 5 hours = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it'll take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the costs and income.

The tree costs $90 to plant, and it grows 7 lemons per year. Each lemon is sold for $1.50. So, the annual income from the lemons is 7 * $1.50 = $10.50. However, there's also a yearly cost of $3 for watering and feeding the tree.

To find out when Carlos starts making a profit, we need to subtract the cost from the income. The net profit per year is $10.50 (income) - $3 (cost) = $7.50.

Now, we need to divide the initial cost of the tree ($90) by the net profit per year ($7.50) to find out how many years it'll take to cover the cost. 

$90 / $7.50 = 12

So, it'll take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (2/3x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners. This means she has (2/3x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: (2/3x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get: 2/3x - 2 = 10

Next, we can add 2 to both sides: 2/3x = 12

Then, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get: x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

First, we find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the remaining students: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by dividing the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiplying by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is 60."
"To figure out which option is better, we need to calculate how much more each item will be worth after the price increase.

For the jewelry, the price will go up by 2.5%. So, we multiply the original price by 1.025 (which is 100% + 2.5%).
$5,000 * 1.025 = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets, the price will go up by 1.2%. So, we multiply the original price by 1.012 (which is 100% + 1.2%).
$8,000 * 1.012 = $8,160

Since $8,160 is more than $5,250, the electronic gadgets are the better choice.

To find the profit, we subtract the original price from the new price.
For the jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For the electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward). 

Since they travel the same distance on the first day, each train covers 80 miles westward. On the second day, they cover 150 miles northward. 

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances. 

Total distance = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. She works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 * 20 = $700. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are $700 * 50 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 * 30 = $450. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are $450 * 50 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary. $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has left to cover the entire 12-mile trail.

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. To find the speed required to cover the remaining distance, we need to calculate the time left and the distance left.

Time left = Total time - Time spent so far
Time left = 3 - 2
Time left = 1 hour

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 9 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth (23) from his current age (25).

Years ago Raymond's son was born = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at son's birth
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 2

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total. The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total. The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find out how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

We can do this by subtracting the start time from the end time. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what number, when decreased by 25%, equals $19.50. 

Let's call the original price ""x"". We can set up an equation: x - 0.25x = 19.50. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.75x = 19.50. 

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get x = 26.

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The first stop was 20 miles into the 60-mile trip. To find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, we subtract 20 from 60:

60 - 20 = 40 miles

The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop, we subtract 15 from 60:

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's think about it another way. If the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, that means it's 15 miles from the end of the trip. So, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the point 15 miles before the end of the trip.

To do this, we can subtract 15 from the total distance and then subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

60 - 15 = 45 miles (distance from the second stop to the end of the trip)
45 - 20 = 25 miles

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"To find the current ages of Darrell and Allen, we can use the information that their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. Let's represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar. 

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans. 

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

There are 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. So, we multiply 10 dogs by 0.5 hours per dog:

10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we're told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than that, we add 5 to 20, which equals 25 jewels for Aaron.

Lastly, we're informed that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total, which is 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = points in the first 20 minutes + points in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets and subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find the amount he spent on video games and had left by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets: $195 - $160 = $35.

Now, we know he had $35 left after buying the video games and had $5 left, so the amount he had initially must be $35 + $5 = $40.

To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

Since he sold all his Lego sets, we can find the number of Lego sets he has left by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had initially: 13 - 13 = 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information:

Now, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4 to find Brandon's iPhone age: 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

The total number of pieces initially set out is 5 pies multiplied by 8 pieces per pie, which equals 40 pieces. After the guests took their share, 14 pieces were left. 

To find the number of pieces taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you have left in your daily target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories left.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100g, we multiply 0.8 servings by 100g per serving.

0.8 * 100 = 80g

So, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he used 1 pound of beeswax, and he already accounted for the cost of the wick in the initial cost of the pound of wax. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."
"To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work.

She had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work. 

80 + 220 = 300

However, she had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since she initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

The final answer is: 243"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to figure out how many blue ties John bought and the cost of a red tie.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each blue tie:

200 ÷ 40 = 5

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is 5 x 2 = 10.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost $40 + (50% of $40). To find 50% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.5, which is $20. So, the cost of a red tie is $40 + $20 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 x $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

15 * 8 = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. 

1/4 * 120 = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by 7.

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out which day the mechanic earned more, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The mechanic earned more on Thursday."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying Trixie's kittens by 3. This gives us 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

We start with 30 lollipops and subtract 2, which gives us 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

The cost of the ticket and popcorn is $14. Peter has $42. 

Let's divide the total money available by the cost of the ticket and popcorn:
$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the maximum weight available for boxes is 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight available for boxes by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes: 245 / 15 = 16.33.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. To find the total, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries, which is 67. So, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

Therefore, there are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

First, we add the cost of the material and the construction: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of $1300. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.1. So, 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts.

First, let's calculate the pension for the first 20 years. Since she gets $50,000 per year, that's a total of $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, for the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the original pension. The original pension is $50,000, so 5% of that is $2,500. Since she gets this amount for 10 years, the total amount for the remaining years is $2,500 * 10 = $25,000.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000

The final answer is: $1,025,000"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid a total of:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so she paid:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid a total of:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons ÷ 4 gallons = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

We can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon: 
100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 3 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
100 * 3 = 4x
300 = 4x
x = 300 / 4
x = 75

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: 75"
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each day and then multiply it by 28 days (4 weeks).

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The answer is 44."
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 / 110 = 8.27 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how much laundry David does, we need to divide Sarah's laundry by 4, since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

"To find the number of games won, we need to figure out how many games the team lost. Let's call the number of games lost ""x"". Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. To find the number of games won, we add 8 to the number of games lost:
7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."

The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

The final answer is: $1556.25"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold (88,000) by 11, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

Let's do the math:

88,000 ÷ 11 = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests, since 1/4 don't show up. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, she will need 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount for adults and children separately.

First, we'll calculate the amount for adults. Since each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we'll calculate the amount for children. It's given that children eat half as much as adults, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. With 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To find the total number of pets the three have, we need to determine the number of pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the age differences between the children.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles now, we need to figure out how much time it took him before his diet change. We know that Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time.

Let's call Gerald's original time 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can say that Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 38 - 2
x = 36

Now that we know Gerald's original time was 36 seconds, we can calculate his new time after his diet change. His speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept.

2/3 of 9 hours = (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Since Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, we can find the difference by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce.

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces.

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't use a fraction of a tomato)

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to consider the total number of cars and the number of cars that took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. So, the number of potted plants she will have left is 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week. So, he drinks 5 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday, but he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water on Sunday. 

Total glasses of water John drinks in a week = 5 (weekdays) + 1 (Saturday) = 6 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which it covers the distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, we multiply 14 (the number of 3-mile sections) by 10 minutes to get the total time.

14 * 10 = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the number of pieces left, we need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces are 750 - 250 = 500.

There are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed."
"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we need to first determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's total by multiplying Amir's amount by 3. This gives us 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody to find the total: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year. Let's start by saying he baked x cookies last year.

This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. This simplifies to 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is $30.00. The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it's $2.00. 

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can divide the total time it took her to reach the shore (64 seconds) by 16 seconds to find the total number of 20-foot intervals: 

64 / 16 = 4

Since she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, she rowed 4 x 20 feet in 4 x 16 seconds = 64 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on for each 20-foot interval. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 x 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 20 feet.

Since Julia rowed 64 feet, the boat took on 64 / 20 = 3.2 times 2 liters of water.

3.2 x 2 = 6.4 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{6.4}$"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons per day and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to divide the total number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6, since his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

First, we need to find the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we divide 1800 by 6 to get the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we divide the number of photographs on Brittany's phone by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Next, we find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards by multiplying the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

We calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

We also calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, we add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Katy used approximately 120 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair and then multiply by the number of children.

First, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes per child (2) by the number of children (3) to get the total number of pairs of shoes: 2 * 3 = 6.

Next, we multiply the total number of pairs of shoes (6) by the cost per pair ($60) to get the total cost: 6 * $60 = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to subtract the initial number of containers from the total number of containers.

Let's do the math:

Initial number of containers = 2
Total number of containers = 30

Number of containers imported on the second day = Total number of containers - Initial number of containers
= 30 - 2
= 28

So, 28 containers were imported on the second day."
"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

We know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. So, we multiply 2 pads/week by 4 weeks/month:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie started.

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as:

60 (letters needing stamps) / 3 = 20 letters

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current total:

30 (already-stamped letters) - 20 (letters put stamps on) = 10 letters

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many. Her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. We can set up an equation based on the information:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. So, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought 82 sausages in total."
"To find the total number of friends, we need to add the number of friends Amy and Lily have. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total. 

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately.

First, we know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$. 

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges cost 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

First, let's find the total time spent on patients. There are 500 people and each person is seen for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent on patients is 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour and the doctors $150 an hour. The total revenue from patients is 500 people * $200/person = $100,000. The total revenue from doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The total revenue is $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000. The total cost is $30,000. 

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000.

The final answer is: $100,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit after the first incident and then subtract that from the initial number of elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves, a third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number: 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract those from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so we subtract $60 from $500 to find the expenditure in June. 

$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditure in May and June to find the total expenditure. 

$500 + $440 = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can multiply 4 by 6 to find the miles walked on Tuesday. 

6 * 4 = 24

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find the total cost of car washes in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes per month by the number of months in a year (12) and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Let's do the math:

4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year
48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since there are 27 unicorns in total, we can find the number of Scottish unicorns by dividing 27 by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 Scottish unicorns.

Next, we're told that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to add up the cost of each item.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

A 20% delivery fee is added to the total cost, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we need to multiply the rate by the time taken. The rate is 5 questions per hour, and he took 8 hours to complete the first test. 

5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

For the second test, the rate is also 5 questions per hour, and he took 6 hours to complete it. 

5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests to find the total number of questions Mark completed: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, we subtract to find the number of questions left incomplete: 
75 - 70 = 5 questions

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of blue gumballs (12) by 4: 12 * 4 = 48
2. Add 22 to the result: 48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know how many cars are semi-automatic. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

There are 20 cars in total. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total, and the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, which is twice the number of queens.

Let's start by finding the number of queens. If we let Q represent the number of queens, then the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 4Q.

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write the equation: 700 = 4Q + 2Q + Q.

Combine like terms: 700 = 7Q.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees."
"To calculate how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first find out how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his weekly earnings would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the food items and the non-food items separately.

The total cost of the food items is the sum of the cost of milk and eggs:
2 (milk) + 3 (eggs) = 5 dollars

The total cost of the non-food items is the sum of the cost of light bulbs, cups, and roach traps:
3 (light bulbs) + 3 (cups) + 4 (roach traps) = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on the non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
10 (non-food items) * 0.10 (10% tax) = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items:
10 (non-food items) + 1 (tax) = 11 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax):
5 (food items) + 11 (non-food items) = 16 dollars

The total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to find the total expenses for his clients. 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, he'll need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 packs of cloths.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so 16 bottles will cost 16 * $2 = $32.
The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so 8 packs will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find his profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To figure out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information step by step.

First, we know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees. So, at this point, 30 + 15 = 45 bees have returned.

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. This means that 60 bees left the hive in the last 6 hours.

We also know that all the bees that left in the first 6 hours hadn't returned yet. Since 15 bees had already returned, that means 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned. In the last 6 hours, all of these 15 bees return.

To find the total number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we add the 15 bees that hadn't returned yet to the 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours. This gives us 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

The final answer is 75."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine who will be waiting for whom, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. First, we convert the distance to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. We convert the distance to feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find out how long Tim will be waiting for Steve. We subtract the time it takes for Steve to get home from the time it takes for Tim to get home: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle.

First, let's calculate the cost for bicycles. Since each bicycle has 2 tires and costs 25 cents to inflate, we multiply the number of bicycles (5) by 2 and then by 0.25. This gives us 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

Next, we calculate the cost for tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires and costs 25 cents to inflate, so we multiply the number of tricycles (3) by 3 and then by 0.25. This gives us 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

Lastly, we calculate the cost for the unicycle, which has 1 tire and costs 25 cents to inflate. We simply multiply 1 by 0.25, resulting in $0.25.

Now, we add the costs together: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl gets, we need to calculate the total cost of the cookies and subtract that from the $10 bill he paid with.

First, we find the total number of cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies by multiplying the number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants ate, there were 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.

A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. We can set up an equation: 1/3 * x = 6. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3, which gives us x = 6 * 3 = 18.

So, before the raccoon ate, there were 18 fries.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. This means that before the seagull ate, Dave had 14 + 7 = 21 fries.

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per week on these days. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so he spends 3 * 16 = 48 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Kimo also has 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week on these days. In one semester, he spends 4 * 16 = 64 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we add the hours spent on each type of day: 48 + 64 = 112 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. There are 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.

Now, we calculate the total length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 24 inches long (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches). So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 24 = 1440 inches.

To find the total length of all the baked goods, we add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

First, we calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape. The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly requirement by 2 to get the total requirement for 2 months.

For the monkeys, 200 bananas per month * 2 months = 400 bananas.
For the gorillas, 400 bananas per month * 2 months = 800 bananas.
For the baboons, 100 bananas per month * 2 months = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to consider the changes in the number of tadpoles in the pond.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad, increasing the total number of tadpoles. However, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, which decreases the total number of tadpoles.

Let's calculate the final number of tadpoles:

Initial number of tadpoles: 11
Increase due to tadpoles coming out: +6
Decrease due to tadpoles hiding: -2

Final number of tadpoles = Initial number + Increase - Decrease
= 11 + 6 - 2
= 15

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to find the price increase every 2 months.

The initial price is $20. The price increases by 20% every 2 months. 

Let's calculate the price after 36 months:

Month 2: $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24
Month 4: $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Month 6: $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Month 8: $34.56 + 20% of $34.56 = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
Month 10: $41.47 + 20% of $41.47 = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
Month 12: $49.76 + 20% of $49.76 = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
Month 14: $59.71 + 20% of $59.71 = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
Month 16: $71.65 + 20% of $71.65 = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
Month 18: $85.98 + 20% of $85.98 = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
Month 20: $103.18 + 20% of $103.18 = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
Month 22: $123.82 + 20% of $123.82 = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
Month 24: $148.58 + 20% of $148.58 = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
Month 26: $178.30 + 20% of $178.30 = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
Month 28: $213.96 + 20% of $213.96 = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
Month 30: $256.75 + 20% of $256.75 = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30
Month 32: $308.30 + 20% of $308.30 = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96
Month 34: $369.96 + 20% of $369.96 = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95
Month 36: $443.95 + 20% of $443.95 = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to know the cost of each type of toy.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can find the cost of the doll by multiplying the cost of an action figure by 3:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"So, Jackie is thinking about whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll miss out on $35 per hour. The accountant charges $90.

To figure out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the money she'll make by doing her taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

If she loses 3 hours of work at $35 per hour, that's a total loss of 3 * $35 = $105. Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90.

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: €77"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans (15) by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting (3).

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get the required eggs."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the ages of Seth and Brooke. Let's say Seth's current age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age is x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total miles walked in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

There are 5 weekdays, and Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles each day, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

First, let's calculate the legs of the spiders. There are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so we multiply 80 by 8 to get 640 legs.

Next, we calculate the legs of the insects. There are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we multiply 90 by 6 to get 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.

Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"So, Jessica has some debts that she needs to pay off. She has student loans, credit cards, and a mortgage. The minimum payments for these are $300, $200, and $500, respectively. 

To find out how much she pays each month, we need to add these amounts together. 

$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we multiply it by 0.5. 

0.5 x $1000 = $500

We add this to the total minimum payment: 

$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is how much Jessica pays each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12.

$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes, and time to cut one potato is 5 seconds. We need to convert the time to cut the potato into minutes for consistency. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, we add the time to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes.

To make the answer more understandable, we can convert the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they made 1 gallon, they spent $35 on lemons.

$35"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is the difference between the total number of Asians and the number of Japanese.

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. 

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. 

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$. 

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$. 

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$. 

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$. 

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. 

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all his expenses and donations."
"To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we need to determine how many crabs each person has and then add them up.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

Lloyd earns $10 an hour. He tutored for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. 

First, we calculate the earnings for each week: 
For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Now, we add the earnings for both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total votes since the winner got 3/4 of the votes. 

The total number of students who voted is 80. 

Number of votes the loser got = (1/4) * 80
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To find Jean's age, we need to break down the information given. 

We know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in total time between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.5) * 100% = 0%

So, Jerry is not more or less likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 0%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom. 

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate Jenna's apples by dividing her mom's apples by 2. 

20 / 2 = 10 apples

Now, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom to find the total. 

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples

Therefore, Jenna and her mom picked a total of 30 apples."
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits.

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw used is 160, the number of straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for rats is 3 x 6 = 18.

Since 90 pieces of straw are used for rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces, the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

First, we find the interest for 1 month. Since Mandy owes $100 and the interest rate is 2%, we multiply the principal by the rate.

$100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we multiply the interest for 1 month by 3.

$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

$100 + $6 = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find out how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold. The selling price per bag is $30, and the profit is $400. So, the total revenue is $400 + $22 (the cost of transportation) = $422.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
30x = 422, where x is the number of bags sold.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 30:
x = 422 / 30
x = 14.07

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we round down to the nearest whole number. The trader sold 14 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of all expenses first. 

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. Since they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. 

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we add up the costs of tickets, food, and rides to get the total cost. 
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3. 
Cost per person = $102 / 3 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

The total amount of insects per week is 3.5 pounds. 

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to consider the trees he plants and the trees he chops down.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees. However, he also chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom starts with 50 trees. After planting 100 trees and chopping down 20 trees, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which equals 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping:

130 - 39 = 91 trees

So, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are now 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons. She needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, the cost of a pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to divide the total amount of carrots available by the number of restaurants and then subtract that from the total amount available.

There are 200 pounds of carrots and 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

First, we divide the total amount of carrots by the number of restaurants: 200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant.

Since each restaurant gets 2 pounds, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each gets: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

Now, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The total population is 23786, and the number of men and women combined is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. 

So, the number of children is 23786 - 17509 = 6277."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to figure out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so we multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find out how much Mark makes from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so we multiply the amount Mark makes from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he makes from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate the total amount of water he gets in a day as follows:

Morning: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total water per day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

"So, John won an award at work. The award is worth $5,000 and it's a one-time thing. He makes $2,000 a week, and he gets paid every week of the year. If he got the award on the first day of the year, how much money did he make that year?

To figure this out, we need to calculate how much he made before the award and then add the award amount. He makes $2,000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:
$2,000 * 52 = $104,000

Then, we add the award amount:
$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

So, John made $109,000 that year.

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons/acre, which equals 50 tons. Then, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton, which equals 100 barrels.

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she has 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she has 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens together:
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score she needs for an average of 93. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. To do this, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half as much as each chocolate bar, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To find the cost of each cup, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 x 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we can divide $60 by $5:
$60 / $5 = 12

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60. To do this, we can divide $60 by $4:
$60 / $4 = 15

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red chickens Jerry has. Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens and white chickens. We'll say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, so the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y, where y is the amount of water in the small pool now.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00. 

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage of $8.00. 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"To find out how much Janeth will owe after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay. 

First, we need to find 10% of the initial amount she borrowed. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. So, the total amount she needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she's paying $165 per month for 12 months, we multiply $165 by 12 to get the total amount she'll pay: $165 x 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she'll pay from the total amount she needs to pay: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase."
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to find their current ages and add them up, then divide by 3.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. So, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Now, we know that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we multiply Harriet's age by 3 to find Adrian's age. Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add up their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. Then, we are told that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias can be calculated by subtracting 40 from 90.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = 90 + 50 = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of $15,000.

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for $30 an hour and used it for 3 hours. So, his total cost is 3 * $30 = $90.

Benji rented a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and used it for 5 hours. So, his total cost is 5 * $18 = $90.

Now, we add their costs together: $90 + $90 = $180.

"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. 
The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The answer is 9."
"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. He also gets 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. 

First, let's add the base burrito and the extra items:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to determine how many pieces they can place per minute. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we need to subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10. This gives us $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the registration fees. Mark pays $1,000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. So, the total registration fees are 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add up the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost. $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday by adding 5 to Robert's total. This gives us 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find the total number of shells she collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. This gives us 2 * 25 = 50 shells.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins went in each direction. 

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean. 
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many tomatoes Steve needs, we first need to figure out how many he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply that by 7 to get the total for the week.

6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we divide 42 by 2 to find out how many she eats.

42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices he wants to serve by the number of slices per pizza. 

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so the total number of slices needed is 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order.

80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many full pens Ram can make from the 25 pens. Since he can make one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means Ram can make 5 full pens from the 25 pens. Since he uses all the pens to make the new pens, he won't have any empty pens left.

Therefore, Ram will have 5 full pens.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the initial $20 to the extra $10 he received, which gives us a total of $30. Then, we multiply this total by 3 to account for the tripling of his money. 

$30 * 3 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine their individual ages based on the given information.

We know that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25. 

Next, we find Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages by adding Jessa's, Joan's, and Mary's ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we multiply 1000 by 0.3.

0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3 and divide by 5.

(3/5) * 700 = (3 * 700) / 5 = 2100 / 5 = 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.

700 - 420 = 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies each person has and then compare their amounts.

We know John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2.

Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's amount to find James' amount. James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' amount from John's amount: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week. In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing per week, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 60 pages * 6 minutes = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss and the extra minutes he used for calls to other people.

Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7. This simplifies to x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish in each aquarium. Let's start by using the information that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. 

We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in the other. The difference between these two numbers is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. 

Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation 28 = 2x, where x represents the number of fish in each aquarium. 

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how much the makeup artist paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost before the discount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

A 10% discount is given because of the amount of work done. To find 10% of $30,000, we multiply 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The total amount paid is the cost before the discount minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up the total cost of all the party supplies. 

The total cost is $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96.

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people: $96 ÷ 3 = $32.

So, each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the cost per pound.

First, we multiply the number of bags (4) by the weight of each bag (50 pounds), which gives us 4 * 50 = 200 pounds.

Next, we multiply the total weight (200 pounds) by the cost per pound ($1.50), which gives us 200 * $1.50 = $300.

Therefore, the chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since we are asked about the calories consumed, we need to multiply the total cookies eaten by 200 calories per cookie.

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

Since the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the number of apps on Travis' tablet now, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps and then add the number of apps he downloaded.

We start with the initial number of apps, which is 61. Then, we subtract the number of apps he deleted, which is 9. This gives us 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps he downloaded, which is 18. So, 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the number of apps on Travis' tablet now is 70."
"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. 

Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today. 

Now, we can calculate the number of wolves he killed today: 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
- Total number of animals Rick killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first determine how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of cows in each stall becomes:
20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) / 20 stalls = 6 cows per stall.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. 
Number of cows in 8 stalls = 6 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 48 cows.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins. There are 100 pennies, which is 100 x $0.01 = $1. There are 40 nickels, which is 40 x $0.05 = $2. Lastly, there are 20 dimes, which is 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Now, let's add the values of the coins together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5. Then, we add the value of the dollar bills, which is 40 x $1 = $40.

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $5 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to find the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books. Since she owes $0.50 for each book and she has 8 books, we multiply 8 by 0.50. This gives us 8 * 0.50 = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue. So, $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2. 

16 / 2 = 8

Now that we know there are 8 golf balls, we need to find out how many of them are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls by dividing the number of golf balls by 2.

8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows separately.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house and then by the number of windows per bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we need to add the number of additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and there are 2 houses, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house.

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows.

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the prices of the items together.

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

The total cost is $15.99. 

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

The cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet, which equals $800. 
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet, which equals $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400, which equals $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given.

The song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we multiply 80 by 2/5, which equals 32 cards.

Next, we subtract the cards with the letter A from the total number of cards: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B, which is half of the remaining cards: 48 / 2 = 24 cards.

After that, we subtract the cards with the letter B from the remaining cards: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Now, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C, which is 5/8 of the remaining cards: 24 * 5/8 = 15 cards.

Finally, we subtract the cards with the letter C from the remaining cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60. 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes. Again, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60. 150 minutes / 60 = 2.5 hours.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 1.5 hours + 2.5 hours = 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If we let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total amount Peter paid is $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To calculate the total number of people, we need to consider the team members, coaches, and their guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests to get the total number of people: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13.

Since Maddy can't buy a fraction of a pizza, she needs to buy 13 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost of pizzas is 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and then add them up.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To find the brother's age in 3 years, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2, since he is twice her age. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age. 
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents. The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents.

To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones first. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed. The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Let's say the total number of medals given out for counting is 'x'. Since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together, which is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out, we can set up the equation: 10x = 39.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10 = 3.9.

However, since the number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider the context of the problem. The question states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This implies that the total number of medals given out is a multiple of 10. 

Considering this, we can multiply 39 by 10 to get the total number of medals given out: 39 * 10 = 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We know there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works and then multiply it by her earnings per minute.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of the three friends, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round. 

First, we find the initial points of each player:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, all players get an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will get an extra point each.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Since the youngest son is half the age of the oldest, he also washed half of the oranges the oldest son washed, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. 

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity on both days and add them together.

On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses.

For the second day, let's calculate the number of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. So, the bids were $200, $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids were $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350, so we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) = $650

However, we also need to add the cost of the bids made by the other 3 people. 

$50 (first bid) + $50 (second bid) + $50 (third bid) = $150

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen's last bid. 

$650 + $150 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how much John pays for driving, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a year. 

Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John gets a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the cost of driving plus the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the tabloid.

Since the tabloid is folded in half, we have two sides: left and right. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

However, we also need to consider the front and back of each side. 

- The left side has 8 pages (pages 1-8) on the front and 8 pages (pages 9-16) on the back.
- The right side has 8 pages (pages 17-24) on the front and 8 pages (pages 25-32) on the back.

So, we need 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of paper for the front and 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of paper for the back.

In total, we need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month. 

Since Watson works 5 days a week and there are 4 weeks in April, he works a total of 5 * 4 = 20 days in April.

He earns $10 per hour and works for 10 hours each day, so his daily earnings are 10 * 10 = $100.

His total earnings for the month are 20 * $100 = $2000.

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the month since the company performed well. So, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2.

20 / 2 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to first find out how much weight Joey loses per week.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses per week.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks by the weight lost per week to find the total weight lost.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to find the number of extra arms. 15 ÷ 3 = 5.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the number of extra legs. 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items he bought. He bought 6 business suits at $100 each, which is 6 * $100 = $600. He also bought 3 suitcases at $50 each, which is 3 * $50 = $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has a total budget of $6000. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the cost of the items from his budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we need to subtract that from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by these three people in a week is 9 x 7 = 63 eggs.

Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by these two people in a week is 4 x 7 = 28 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a week is the sum of the eggs consumed by both groups, which is 63 + 28 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information. 

First, we know Quinn is 30 years old. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age to find Jane's age. 

30 - 3 = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age, as Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

27 + 5 = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To find the current population of Chile, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's current age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

Next, we're told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. To find the population of Chile six years ago, we multiply Noah's age by 3000.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
Population of Chile six years ago = 120,000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
Population of Chile now = 2 * 120,000
Population of Chile now = 240,000

The final answer is: 240,000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, let's break down the information given. We know that the total number of players is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to determine how many sets of 3 electric wires are needed. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3.

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since each set of 3 electric wires requires 1 electric pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of women left at the party, we need to first determine the total number of people who left. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's start by finding the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the total number of people at the party. Then, 1/4 of x is the number of people who left. We know that 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3). Since 3 men left, and 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up the equation:

3 = 1/4x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

12 = x

So, the total number of people at the party is 12.

Now, we know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 people. Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 3 (because 3 men and 3 women left in total). To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 3 = 12

However, we are told that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 3 men left, and 3 women left. So, the correct number of women left is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information. 

First, we know the book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2. This gives us $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we're told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, to find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the magazine's cost. This gives us $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

So, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many new records the 5 people got and then work backwards to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can divide the total number of new records by 5 to find out how many new records each person got. However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll assume that each person got 1 new record.

Now, we know that each person got 1 new record, and they traded 2 old records for each new record. So, for each person, the number of old records traded is equal to the number of new records they got.

Since each person got 1 new record, they must have traded 1 old record.

Now, we multiply the number of old records each person traded by the number of people:

1 old record per person * 5 people = 5 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 5 old records.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

First, we find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, we multiply 100 (the total number of employees) by 2/5.

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Next, we find the number of senior programmers. We subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we know the salaries of junior and senior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than that, so $2400 per month.

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total salaries of junior and senior programmers.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to consider the information given. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. However, we also know that 7 people got off at the second stop.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we add the number of people who got on at the first stop (5) and the number of people who got on at the second stop (8). This gives us 5 + 8 = 13.
2. Then, we subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop (7) from the total we calculated in step 1. This gives us 13 - 7 = 6.

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the events step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He then eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to figure out how much more charge it needs. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. So, to find out how long it will take to charge 40%, we can divide 40 by 1 and multiply by 3.

40 / 1 = 40
40 * 3 = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the initial number of lollipops Erin has to the number her mother gives her. So, 7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (additional lollipops) = 17 lollipops.

Next, we subtract the number of lollipops Erin gives to Ella. So, 17 (total lollipops) - 3 (lollipops given to Ella) = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To figure out which job Nick should take, we need to calculate how much he'll make in each job.

Job A pays $15 an hour and he works 2000 hours a year. So, his total income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000. But, he has to pay 20% of that in taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, his net income is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax. So, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, he has to pay 10% of that in taxes, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So, his net pay is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Job B has a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of castles in Scotland. 

40% of 220 is 0.4 * 220 = 88. 

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we divide 88 by 2. 

88 / 2 = 44

There are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is 44."

"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Let's add them up: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4: 24 / 4 = 6

So each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers and fudge separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers. Since Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers and he wants to make 8 batches, we multiply 30 ounces by 8.

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge, and he wants to make only 1 batch. So, we multiply 70 ounces by 1.

70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for suckers and fudge together to get the total amount of sugar Mason needs.

240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. If the initial price of each share is $8 and it increases by 50%, we multiply the initial price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase). So, the value after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year. If the price decreases by 25%, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease). So, the value after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate and then compare their amounts.

First, we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can calculate John's hot dog count by dividing Thomas's amount by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of students is 200, and they are divided into three groups. Two of the groups are equal in number, and the third group is 10 students less than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We can set up an equation based on the given information: 200 - x = x - 10. This equation represents the relationship between the number of students in the smallest group and the two larger groups.

Simplifying the equation, we get 200 = 2x - 10. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 210 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 105 = x.

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students.

The final answer is 105."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Let's use the information that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. If we let the number of cows be x, then the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

At the end of the fourth week, Josh had 6 balls. However, he dropped 3 balls, and 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball.

6 - 1 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to calculate the weight of each animal and add the weight of the container.

We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

First, let's calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to find the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount on one shirt first. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30. 

40% of $30 is 0.4 * $30 = $12. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt: $30 - $12 = $18. 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $18 * 2 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day for $100 each, so their daily revenue from tractors was 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos a day for $220 each, so their daily revenue from silos is 5 * $220 = $1100.

The total daily revenue is $1000 + $1100 = $2100. To find the difference in daily revenue, we subtract the original revenue from the new revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost of food, treats, and medicine per month.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month and food costs $25 per week, we multiply the cost per week by 4:

$25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month

Next, we add the cost of treats, which is $20 per month, and the cost of medicine, which is $100 per month:

$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

To find the total amount spent per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Peyton has a one hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, which is 3 hours, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours, and two hours of errands on Friday.

Now, let's add the hours together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Let's break it down:

Initial amount = $36
Amount spent on sweater = $11
Amount given to brother = $4

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows that were 2 hours each, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours. So, her earnings from the first job are 20 hours * $10/hour = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours. So, her earnings from the second job are 15 hours * $5/hour = $75.

Now, let's add her initial savings of $80 to her total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275. Then, we add $80 to that total: $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since she saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to first determine how much money he had left after buying the gumballs. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

We know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have had $8 initially. Since he spent $1.5 on candy, he must have had $8 - $1.5 = $6.5 left.

Now, we can divide $6.5 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.33}$"
"To find the son's age, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the son's age is S and Carver's age is C. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be written as C = 2S - 5. We can substitute C = 45 into this equation to find S.

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate S:
50 / 2 = S
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days, or 0.38 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number."
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed.

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed, we add the amounts for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds and divide by 2.

The average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs 4 chihuahua beds, which require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

He also needs 3 collie beds, which require 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to add the time taken for the detour. The detour is 10 miles and the speed is 70 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 / 70
Time = 0.14 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time taken.

Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3
Total time taken = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

Therefore, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 87."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys first. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can divide the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To pass the school year, Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from the three tests. She has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. 

To find out the minimum points she needs on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points. 

42 (total required points) - 33 (points scored so far) = 9

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out.

Let's start by finding the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Since it's four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5, we can calculate it as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 7

Now, we know that 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, we multiply the number of shoplifters by 3:

3 * 7 = 21

We now know that 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out:

50 (total) - 3 (refusing to wear masks) - 7 (shoplifting) - 21 (physical violence) = 19

Therefore, 19 customers were kicked out for other reasons."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points Sara had first. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. So, Sara had approximately 4 points before.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4
Erin's points before = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880. Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: $884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. To find 20% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.20. This gives us $80. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours for each day.

Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. This means Saturday's practice is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Total hours per week = 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment, and 40% of the total number were faulty. This means 60% of the equipment is functioning.

Number of functioning pieces = 60% of 400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000 = 240,000

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000

Final answer: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls. She then gave 6 rolls to her children. To find out how many rolls she had left, we subtract the number of rolls given to the children from the total number of rolls: 12 - 6 = 6.

Next, we need to determine how many pieces each of the remaining rolls was broken into. According to the problem, each roll was broken into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils are left after removing those who like blue. This would be 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Next, we're told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils. So, 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Let's do the math step by step:

1. First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had (23) to the number of cookies Janet gave her (42). This gives us a total of 65 cookies.

2. Then, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate (44) from the total number of cookies. However, since 65 is less than 44, we need to consider that the result will be negative.

   65 - 44 = -23

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

Final answer: 0"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to calculate the interest first. The interest is 10% of the $3,650 she borrowed. 

10% of $3,650 is $365. So, the total amount she needs to pay is $3,650 + $365 = $4,015.

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5 to find out the monthly payment. 

$4,015 ÷ 5 = $802

So, Karan has to pay $802 each month."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 km/h for 5 hours. To find her distance, we multiply her speed by the time she hiked: Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe. The difference is 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Since she spends $18 on supplies, her total cost is $18.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser and the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil, then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers: 6 erasers * $2 = $12
Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils: 8 pencils * $3 = $24

Now, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36

The total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we add the number of messages to Mr. Yu to the number of messages to Ms. Thompson to find the total.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22 = 88

The final answer is: $\boxed{88}$"
"To determine how much David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 9 ride tickets to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

A ride bracelet costs $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The correct answer is $12."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and 12 gifts in total (6 for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers). 

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: 12"
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

We then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by 11:
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Since the ratio is 5:6, we multiply 15 by 6 to find the number of popsicles Sam has:
15 * 6 = 90

Now, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has (15 * 5 = 75) from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"So, Tim is thinking of canceling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services. He's getting Netflix for $10 a month. The other two services, Hulu and Disney Plus, normally cost $10 each, but he gets a discount because he's bundling them. The discount is 20% of the total cost of the two services.

To find 20% of $10, I'll multiply $10 by 0.20. That's $2. So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of the other two services. $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Tim's cable package costs $60 per month. To find out how much he'll save by canceling it, I'll subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package. $60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42.

So, Tim will save $42 per month by canceling his cable package."
"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to add up the time she spent on each activity. She spent 4 hours writing, 1.5 hours recording, and 1.5 hours editing.

First, let's convert the recording time to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

So, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total capacity is 6 x 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we need to find double the capacity first. Double the capacity is 2 x 36 = 72 books.

Then, we add 20 more books to that, so 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

So, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices of pizza are left, we need to calculate how many slices Jenny gave away and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. She also gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

The cost of the bike is $300, and Mark earns $10 per day. To find the number of days, we can divide $300 by $10.

$300 ÷ $10 = 30

So, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age by adding 5 to Erica's age: 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Next, we find Alice's age by adding 7 to Beth's age: 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Let's break it down step by step:

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total ounces = 2 * 8 = 16 ounces
Total calories = 16 * 3 = 48

So, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of working days he has in a year. 

Since he works 4 weeks a month and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply 4 weeks by 4 weeks to get the total weeks worked in a year, which is 4 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply 16 weeks by 52 weeks to get the total number of working days in a year, which is 16 * 52 = 832 days.

The builder earns $50 per day, so his total earnings for the year would be 832 * 50 = $41600.

The final answer is: $41600"
"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient he needs for the quadruple batch.

For flour, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much energy Mel saves when he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to calculate the difference in energy usage between the original and the new usage.

First, we find the energy used in 30 days at the original rate. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy each hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). For 30 days, it would be 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh.

Now, let's calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours. The new daily usage is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and the new usage: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

To convert Wh to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000: 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

So, the energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh.

The final answer is: 4050"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive at the airport 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, leaving 3/4 of the employees. 
3/4 of 40 employees = 30 employees
The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The taffy was on sale, so she got 2 pounds for $3. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, the price of the second pound is $3 - ($3/2) = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

$3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20. So, the discount is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply 2 by 30 to get the total number of cookies she needs: 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Now, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 12, since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. This will give us the number of dozens she needs. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog. Since we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode, we can't directly calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, as there's no other information provided.

To find 5% of 50,000, we multiply 50,000 by 0.05.

50,000 x 0.05 = 2,500

Therefore, 2,500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

2,500"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can find the discount by multiplying the regular price by 0.30.

Discount per blouse = 0.30 x $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 x $14
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 90 apples from the shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as A. We know that Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

So, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 380"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and bumps.

Let's assume the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'.

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of bumps is 2c + d.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

c + d = 180

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304, so we can write another equation:

2c + d = 304

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' and 'd' by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the locker sizes. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 

First, we find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4, since it's 1/4 as big. 

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Next, we find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2, since it's half as big. 

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the elevation of Stanley and the distance the comb fell. 

The elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet (Stanley's elevation) + 4,000 feet (distance the comb fell) = 14,000 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. 

The difference in elevation is 14,000 feet (Stanley's comb) - 3,000 feet (Oliver's elevation) = 11,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is 11,000."
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

He initially had $5000. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $8000. 

So, we add the initial amount to the amounts he got from the banks: $5000 + $4000 + $8000.

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since 4 boats came and each carried 5 cats, we multiply 4 by 5 to get the total number of cats taken away: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so we multiply that by 6 to get $48. Then, the next 8 months cost $12 per month, so we multiply that by 8 to get $96. Finally, the last 8 months cost $14 per month, so we multiply that by 8 to get $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to first figure out the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans. This means 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). 

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

There are 4 buses that can hold 60 employees each. So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

There are also 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees each. So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, there are 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees each. So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he must have made $50 from selling the cards.

Let's say he started with x cards. He sells x - 1/3 cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5(x - 1/3).

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5(x - 1/3) = 50

To solve for x, we need to first simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.5 = 50

Now, add 0.5 to both sides:

1.5x = 50.5

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 50.5 / 1.5
x = 33.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 33

So, Kenny started with 33 cards.

The final answer is 33."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared in total. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, this is not enough for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Let's assume the caterer prepared x hotdogs in total. Since 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests, the remaining hotdogs are:

x - 36 = 22

To find the total number of hotdogs, we can add the hotdogs prepared for the 18 guests to the hotdogs prepared for the remaining 22 guests:

x = 36 + 22
x = 58

So, the caterer prepared 58 hotdogs in total.

Now, we know the caterer prepared 58 hotdogs and 40 guests showed up. Since 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

58 hotdogs - 40 guests = 18 hotdogs

Since each hotdog is for one guest, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of 6 is 3. 

Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the 20% discount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20:
0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, who used a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This means Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. This means Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can multiply 15 gallons by 8 pints/gallon to get the total number of pints. 

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Then, we need to find 1/4 of 120 pints.

1/4 of 120 pints = 120 * 1/4 = 30 pints

So, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to calculate how much money he spent on chips and candy bars. 

First, we know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents and George bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Since there are 8 pieces in total and 2 people had a piece, the number of remaining pieces is 8 - 2 = 6.

The weight of the remaining cake can be calculated by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of remaining pieces. 

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake / Number of remaining pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 / 6
Weight of the remaining cake = 3.33 ounces

The remaining cake weighs approximately 3.33 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add Sitti and Juris's oranges together and then divide by the total number of people, including themselves and their 6 friends.

First, let's add Sitti and Juris's oranges: 34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to divide the total oranges by the total number of people. There are 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes her to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it takes Bernadette 4 x 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. The oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it's on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature change due to baking is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the cooling effect. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The window is open for 30 minutes, so the temperature change due to cooling is 2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 (since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes) = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. Adding the temperature change due to baking, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees. Then, subtracting the temperature change due to cooling, we get 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

First, let's find James' swim time. Since he finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we can calculate it by subtracting 10% of Jon's swim time from Jon's swim time. 

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, let's find James' bike time. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

So, James' run time is 59 minutes."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and it runs for 16 miles, the total amount of hay eaten is 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails.

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has: $30 - $24 = $6.

Therefore, Michael has $6 in change."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, each tray can hold 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 / 25 = 2.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to compare his score to Marcy's score after both of them have made their moves.

Joey initially had 214 points. He then scored 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy initially had 225 points. She then scored 10 points, bringing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find out how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score: 240 - 235 = 5.

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each and the rest for $25 each. 

First, let's find out how many sneakers were sold for $25. We can do this by subtracting the number of sneakers sold for $20 from the total number of sneakers: 48 - 17 = 31.

Now, we can calculate the revenue from selling the sneakers at $25: 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from selling the sneakers at $20 and $25: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

There are two types of packets: six packets with 8 colors each and four packets with 16 colors each. 

We can find the total number of colors in the six packets by multiplying 6 (the number of packets) by 8 (the number of colors in each packet), which gives us 6 x 8 = 48 colors.

Similarly, we can find the total number of colors in the four packets by multiplying 4 (the number of packets) by 16 (the number of colors in each packet), which gives us 4 x 16 = 64 colors.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

So, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is 112."
"To find the regular price of the popcorn, let's analyze the situation. 

We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2 by not buying it. This means the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. To find the cost of the popcorn, we subtract the cost of the movie ticket from $17, which is $17 - $12 = $5.

The cost of the soda is $3.

The final answer is $5."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the new cost of filling one balloon. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was $20 more. So, the new cost of filling each balloon is $900 / 20 + $20 = $55.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 170 x $55 = $9350.

The final answer is: $9350"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days. 

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day. 

In 30 days, they will eat 8 apples per day * 30 days = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. Since the beds are 2 feet tall, we don't need to multiply by the height.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green cards first. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 

60% of 15 (the number of red cards) is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, we know the number of red cards (15), green cards (24), and yellow cards (which is the sum of red and green cards).

The number of yellow cards is 15 + 24 = 39.

The total number of cards is 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78.

"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can break down the events as follows:

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, half of the initial number of fairies flew in from the east, which is 50 / 2 = 25. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes after that, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75, which gives us 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which weigh 2 pounds each. He also buys 4 bags of carrots, which weigh 12 pounds each. Then, he buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, and 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds.

Let's add up the weights:
- 2 boxes of sugar cubes = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips. The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. She also has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350 cards. She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student got 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students. 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples they bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9.
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount.
Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8, so Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Let's break it down:

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items per room.

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of items per room by 80: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to follow the order of events.

First, we start with 200 shoes. Then, he gets 5 pairs on Monday, which is equivalent to 10 individual shoes (since each pair has 2 shoes). So, he now has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

Next, he gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday, which is equivalent to 30 individual shoes. Adding these to his current total, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

After that, he gains 30 more pairs on Friday, which is equivalent to 60 individual shoes. Adding these to his current total, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

Finally, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. Subtracting these from his current total, he now has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to figure out how many cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold to find out how many pans Mary needs.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1.

The pen costs $2, so three times the price of the pen is 2 * 3 = $6.
The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it costs 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is 10 - 7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the number of pencils left, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially. Since there are 30 students in the class and each student starts with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils were used in two months. We know that 1/5 of the total pencils were used, so we multiply 300 by 1/5 to get 60 pencils used.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year: 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can start by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100

"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

First, we need to find out how many days Jason has to walk in total. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 3 weeks by 7 days per week.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes per day for 4 days a week to break in his new shoes in 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11.43}$"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the total number of kids in the class and the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts.

So, the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12.

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group and then add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees. So, the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

We also need to add the 7 tour guides to the total number of employees. 

Total number of people going on the tour: 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607.

The final answer is 607."
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we can calculate the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has by dividing Ben's amount by 2. This gives us 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so we can calculate the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has by multiplying Ben's amount by 3. This gives us 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint."
"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the amount Keegan and Tashay have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so they need $200 - $174 = $26 more.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

To find out how many songs Gabriel can add, we need to subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity of his player. 

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

80 - 60 = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

We can do this by multiplying 2/5 by 60. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (60) and keep the denominator (5) the same. This gives us (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5.

To divide 120 by 5, we can divide the numerator (120) by the denominator (5), which equals 24.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10 to find the total amount of money he gave up. This equals 24 * 10 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Three times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240. 

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220

The cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"To find out how many hours James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

James runs 12 miles a day and 5 days a week. So, we multiply 12 miles by 5 days.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles per hour, we can divide the total miles per week by 10 to find the total hours per week.

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is 6."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by 5 (the number of days).

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds his horses twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by 50 to find out how many bags: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to calculate two thirds of Jana's total puppies, which is 2/3 * 27 = 18. Then, we need to find one third of those Pomeranians, which is 1/3 * 18 = 6.

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. 

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, we divide the total by 3: -30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The total cost of the toy is $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount he already has
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Since he promises to save $2 daily from his allowance, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount to find out how many days it will take:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of trays and then find the remainder.

Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays, each tray can hold 24 eggs. 

We can divide 64 by 24 to find out how many eggs can be placed on the trays: 64 ÷ 24 = 2 with a remainder of 16.

This means Jaime can place 48 eggs on the trays (2 trays * 24 eggs/tray) and the remaining 16 eggs won't be able to fit.

The correct answer is 16."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we can multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors.

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64 inches. So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64 inches = 256 inches.

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches.

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches.

The shortest girl is 60 inches tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 576 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576 inches / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is 48."
"Charisma works for 8 hours a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 8 * 5 = 40 minutes per day.

After 5 days at the office, she has walked 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find her age in four years. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we multiply Brett's age in four years by 3: 18 * 3 = 54.

Now, we subtract 4 from 54 to find Angela's current age: 54 - 4 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Paul drives twice a day, so we multiply the number of days by 2. 14 days * 2 rides per day = 28 rides.

The cost of the morning rides is $6 per ride, so we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride. 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is $2 per ride, so we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride. 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides together. $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest).
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to use variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick. This means that for every dollar spent, Frederick can get 50 sticks.

For 2 x 8 lumber, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick. This means that for every dollar spent, Frederick can get 66.67 sticks.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber to save money.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks he can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

"To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is 120."

"To calculate the calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to determine how many days he has to achieve this goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
From July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding all these days together, we get: 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories. To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 3500 calories / 180 days = approximately 19.44 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 19.44 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."

So, Julie had $300 left."
"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

So, the house cost $30,000."

"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold: 93 loaves in the morning + 39 loaves in the afternoon = 132 loaves.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked: 200 loaves - 132 loaves = 68 loaves.

Finally, we add the number of loaves returned: 68 loaves + 6 loaves = 74 loaves.

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the smallest number of rows, which is 3 rows.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

We know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can assume that the total amount of raisins will be divided into three parts. 

So, we can divide the total raisins by 3 to find the amount of raisins for each part. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9

Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins, we can multiply the amount of raisins for each part by 3/4 to find the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

9 * 3/4 = 6.75

Since we can't make a fraction of a batch, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Heather can make 6 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Ada's original daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her original weekly consumption, we multiply this by 7 days: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. Since a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, her original weekly bill is 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

Now, let's calculate Ada's new weekly consumption. She's adding a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her new daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. Multiply this by 7 days to get her new weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours. Her new weekly bill is 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. This means that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, since half a house takes 5 days.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can divide that time by 5 to find out how long it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. 10 days divided by 5 is 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 2 days by 24 hours to find the total number of hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. 2 days multiplied by 24 hours is 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to figure out how many chairs Ophelia has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. 

Let's start by finding out how many chairs Ophelia has. We can set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We also know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

The total amount paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought: $44 ÷ $4 = 11.

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours, the weeks he worked 5 hours, and the week he worked 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked 4 hours, let's assume he did this for 5 weeks. So, 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours. However, we are not given the exact number of weeks he worked 4 hours, but we can assume he worked 4 hours for 5 weeks and 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week.

So, the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours is 20 hours. For the week he worked 5 hours: 5 hours. For the week he worked 6 hours: 6 hours.

Now, we add up the hours: 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 31 hours."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Next, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. This means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Finally, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers now is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Jame's current age and then find the age difference between Jame and his cousin.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400. We know the cost of the computer and the printer, so we can subtract these from the total to find the cost of the monitors.

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 / 2 = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating some. We also know that he had twice as many candies as Nick. Let's call the number of candies Nick had ""x"". Since George had twice as many candies as Nick, we can say that George had 2x candies.

We are also told that George ate 5 candies, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2x - 5 = 3. 

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 3 + 5, which simplifies to 2x = 8.

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 8 ÷ 2, which simplifies to x = 4.

So, Nick had 4 candies initially.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add these numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we subtract the total number of vlogs she has made (54) from the total number of vlogs she wants to make (72): 72 - 54 = 18.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, you need to calculate 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is $10. 

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

You ended up paying $60."
"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is $39."
"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to first figure out how much he needs to save in total for the second half. Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125 and there are 15 days in the second half of April, we can divide the total target by 15 to find the daily amount for the second half.

$1125 ÷ 15 = $75

So, Elvis needs to save $75 each day in the second half of the month to hit his target.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit she bought.

She bought three apples at $1.50 each, so the total cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. 

Next, she bought five oranges at $0.80 each, so the total cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

Lastly, she bought six peaches at $0.75 each, so the total cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, we add the total cost of all the fruits together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money, which is 100 dollars, between him and Brad. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can represent Brad's share as x dollars. This means Jeff's share would be 4x dollars.

The equation to represent the situation is x + 4x = 100. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 100. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply x by 4 to find Jeff's share: 4 * 20 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work. 

Distance from home to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps.

First, she writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters. Since she does this twice, the total number of letters in this step is 26 * 2 = 52.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, half of it would be 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half she wrote earlier (13 letters). So, the total number of letters in this step is 52 + 13 = 65.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the number of letters from each step: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to calculate the number of families notified in each round and add them up.

Let's break it down:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are notified.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are notified.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are notified.

Since we're only asked about the fourth round, the answer is the number of families notified in the fourth round.

The correct answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is $1.50 each, so 5 notebooks will cost 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is $0.25 each, so 2 pens will cost 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $20. 10% of $20 is 0.1 * $20 = $2.

The discount amount is $2, so we subtract this from the total cost: $20 - $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we need to find the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of potato fries is 10 packs * $0.30 each pack, which equals $3.
The cost of fruit drinks is 5 cans * $2 each can, which equals $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10, which equals $33.

To find the change Carly gets back, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill. $50 - $33 equals $17.

The final answer is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for sales up to $1000. Since she earns a 30% commission on sales up to $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.3. This gives us $300.

Next, we need to calculate the commission for sales over $1000. The sales over $1000 are $1500 ($2500 - $1000). She earns an additional 10% commission on these sales. To find this amount, we multiply $1500 by 0.1, which equals $150.

Now, we add the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000. $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs for his guests.

Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He's expecting 70 guests, and he wants 2 bottles for each guest. That's a total of 70 x 2 = 140 bottles needed.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 x 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 

First, we calculate his daily earnings: $2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day. Then, we multiply this by the number of days he works in a week: $10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week.

Now, we divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take: $80 / $40/week = 2 weeks.

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Since the foot-long fish sub costs $40, we can calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub as follows:

$40 * 3 = $120

So, the total cost for both subs is $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. 

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30. 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents is 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the total angle the sun has moved upward. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. After 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of 32 + 50 = 82 degrees from the ground.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James has two sons, so he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5.

2 (candles for the 12-year-old) + 2 (candles for the 8-year-old) = 4 candles

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of pages she read in each week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

We know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes by 1.5 and multiply by 2.

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 
70 + 100 = 170 pages

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. To find 1/3 of 12, we can divide 12 by 3. 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. To find 1/4 of 12, we can divide 12 by 4. 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches. 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To find the age of Shiloh's nephew, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's represent the nephew's current age as N. In 7 years, the nephew will be N + 7 years old.

We can set up the equation: 51 = 3(N + 7). Now, let's solve for N.

First, distribute the 3: 51 = 3N + 21.

Next, subtract 21 from both sides: 30 = 3N.

Finally, divide both sides by 3: N = 10.

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of them. 

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation: 
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can set up another equation:
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount Mitchell made from selling lemonades. 

We know Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find the total amount, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price of each lemonade.

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4 = $84

Since Liam made $63, we need to find the difference between the amount Mitchell made and the amount Liam made.

To do this, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $15. He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy $55 / $2 = 27.5. Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures. 

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the 4 broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied in a month: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is $100 * 24 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and they need 1 loaf. So, the cost of bread is $3.00. They also spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. 

The total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first determine the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can calculate this by multiplying 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days: 280 / 7 = 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add half of the starting value to the starting value. Half of 20 is 10, so we have 20 + 10 = 30. Then, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6.

Next, we multiply 6 by the starting value minus 12. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8. Multiplying 6 by 8 gives us 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 18 degrees off from the set temperature. To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. This gives us $22,800. 

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find Juan's house value. $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the combined value of both houses, we add their values together. $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is $10.00. So, the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

First, let's calculate the calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. Then, we calculate the calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories. 

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water. 

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed, we need to add the three measurements together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To figure out how many people are going to the event, we need to add up the number of people Alex invited, the number of friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

First, let's start with the people Alex invited. She invited 100 people.

Next, she invited 200 friends, because each of the 100 people she invited brought 2 friends.

Then, she invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, we need to add 10 friends and 8 spouses to the total.

To find the total number of people, we add 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 318.

So, Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

First, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it is taller than Mark's window.

Let's start by calculating the height of the beanstalk on each day:

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is now 2 * 4 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 2 * 8 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 2 * 16 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), we can stop here.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily amount of protein he consumes. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can divide 200 grams by 100 grams to find out how many cups he eats per day: 
200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Each cup has 3 grams of protein, so we multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup: 
2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 
6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out Jerry's current age. Let's call his current age ""x"".

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can start by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the third angle is the largest, its measure is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal is currently using, we need to calculate the weight he initially increased by 50%. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Then, we add this to the original weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds

Finally, we subtract 2 pounds from this result: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the games from each year: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, he spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 4362.5"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after buying the outfit, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and add the sales tax.

The shirt costs $25, and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the price by 0.3:
$25 * 0.3 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Joe also buys a pair of shorts for $35. The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts:
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax amount. Let's assume a standard sales tax rate of 8% (this is a common rate in many places). To find the sales tax, we multiply the total cost by 0.08:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-6.70"
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street.

The cost per meter is $194, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long. 

Cost for Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter.

Cost for Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"So, John got $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the next 5 months, the funding is 50% more than the first 5 months. That means it's $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 for the 6th month, $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000 for the 7th month, and so on.

Let's add up the funding for the next 5 months: $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000.

Now, we add the funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the next 5 months: $500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000.

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to know how many days are in the month. March has 31 days.

If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the number of days in March by the number of posts per day to get the total number of posts.

Total number of posts in March = 31 days * 3 posts/day
Total number of posts in March = 93

The total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total number of gallons of water used per year and then multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year, he does laundry 52 weeks * 2 = 104 times. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

She initially found an aquarium for $10.00. Then, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which totals to 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Additionally, she purchased 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, resulting in 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. She also bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, giving her a total of 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Lastly, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

The total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

The beanstalk started at 3 inches in the first week. In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, making its total height 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day. Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, we multiply these two numbers together to get the daily meat sales.

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the daily meat sales (150kg) to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the total number of seats in the school auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, we can find the number of seats occupied by administrators by dividing the total number of seats by 4.

72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we can find the number of seats occupied by parents by dividing the remaining seats by 3.

54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is the remaining seats after subtracting the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there are 36 students in the school auditorium.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights first. Since there are 4 street lights at each pole and 6 poles at each intersection, we multiply the number of poles by the number of street lights per pole. 

6 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 24 street lights

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

24 (total street lights) - 20 (non-functioning street lights) = 4 functioning street lights.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

Let's start with the first DVD. It has been played 356 times, so we subtract this from the total number of times it can be played, which is 1000. 

1000 - 356 = 644

Now, let's do the same for the second DVD. It has been played 135 times, so we subtract this from the total number of times it can be played, which is also 1000.

1000 - 135 = 865

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we add the results from both calculations.

644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, so the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions. Since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * $125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to break down his gum-chewing activities.

First, we calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to his total.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is 7."

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, we multiply her speed by 60 to get the speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed that week, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 6 cars per day (since it pulled 4 fewer cars per day). So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height.

First, we convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars. So the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the total cost minus the amount paid by the company, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we need to calculate 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. 

First, we calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then find out how many classes he can afford if the cost per class exceeds $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many he can afford to miss. To do this, we subtract the number of classes his parents are willing to pay for from the total number of classes.

10 (total classes) - 6 (classes his parents are willing to pay for) = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to calculate the daily production of both Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie processes twice as fast, she processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

20 - 3 = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of 5 apples. Since one apple costs $5.20, we multiply 5 by $5.20 to get the total cost of 5 apples. 

5 x $5.20 = $26.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of 5 oranges. Since one orange costs $3.30, we multiply 5 by $3.30 to get the total cost of 5 oranges.

5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together to get the total cost.

$26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $42.50."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first find out how much he gets as a raise. A 5% raise on his $20,000 salary is 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 (raise) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000.

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12. $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The problem states that the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost 1/5 * $750 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 10 shirts, and each shirt costs $60. So, the total cost of shirts is 10 * $60 = $600.

Finally, we add the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts together: $7500 + $150 + $600 = $9250.

The total cost of everything is $9250."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Since Bill can dig 4 feet of soil per hour, we can divide the total feet of soil (24) by 4 to get the time in hours. 

Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Since Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, we can multiply the time it takes to dig through soil by 2. 

Time to dig through clay = 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay

"To find the total number of likes, we need to first find the initial number of likes. We know that three weeks after the initial post, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. Let's call the initial number of likes ""x"". 

We can set up an equation: 70x = 2000. To find x, we divide both sides by 70.

x = 2000 / 70
x = 28.57

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes.

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 28.57 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. The total number of likes is approximately 20129.

The final answer is 20129."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 off = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The correct answer is: $142"
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

Let's start by finding out how much she made from green hats in the first month. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can multiply $400 by 2 to find the sales from green hats. This gives us $800.

Now, we add the sales from red hats ($400) to the sales from green hats ($800) to find the total sales in the first month. $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find 3/4 of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 3 and then divide by 4. This gives us $900.

Now, we add the sales from the first month ($1200) to the sales from the second month ($900) to find the total sales in two months. $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Bank account balance: $420

Subtract the bank account balance from the weekly wage: $300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine how many eggs Lori needs, we need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves she'll need for her guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we multiply the number of guests by 3.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12.

Total dozens needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

The total number of pages in the research paper is 15. Since Shiela has already written 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has left by finding 2/3 of the total number of pages.

2/3 of 15 = (2/3) * 15
= (2 * 15) / 3
= 30 / 3
= 10

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. 

We can calculate the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

200 ÷ 10 = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, and then add them together.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (first year's costs) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to determine the cooking time for each item. We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is $5, and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

To find the cost of the second mixture, we calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is $2, and the cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. The difference in cost is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.
The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'.

From the second equation, we can express 'g' in terms of 's': g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent.

The total cost of the chips is $4.00 (2 * $2.00). The total cost of the chicken and soda is $9.00 ($8.00 + $1.00). 

The total cost of the other items is $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00. 

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, the cost of the apple pie is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is $7.00."
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's do the math:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

First, we multiply the number of classes he attends per week (4) by the number of hours each class lasts (2 hours). This gives us 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply 8 hours/week by 6 weeks to get the total class time: 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total class time (48 hours) by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe (1.5 hours). This gives us 48 / 1.5 = 32.

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. So, there are 90 history teachers. 

Since there are 150 teachers in total, the number of math teachers is 150 - 90 = 60.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep: 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To find out how much money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we need to calculate the total amount of money they have.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars."
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

There are 4 quarters in a basketball game, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the regular quarters is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes. 

Since the last quarter was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie, we need to add this extra time to the total. Therefore, the total length of the game is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by the number of muffins.

For flour, we multiply 5 tablespoons by 16 muffins, which equals 80 tablespoons. 
For sugar, we multiply 3 tablespoons by 16 muffins, which equals 48 tablespoons. 
For salt, we multiply 0.25 tablespoons by 16 muffins, which equals 4 tablespoons.

To get the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we add these amounts together: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To find out how much candy each person will have after sharing, we need to add up the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. Let's add them together: 
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.

Since they want to share it equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:
12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to break down the information given.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days were accounted for, leaving 6 days remaining.

We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15.

Since the first 24 days were accounted for, and 15 of those were good, the number of good days left in the month is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to convert the current height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 20 feet by 12 to get the current height in inches: 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs 1 toy. This leaves him with 4 toys.

There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys in total.

When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

However, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 2 by 5, which equals 0.4. Then we multiply 1200 by 0.4:
   1200 * 0.4 = 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
   1200 - 480 = 720

Then, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find 2/3 of 720, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 2 by 3, which equals approximately 0.67. Then we multiply 720 by 0.67:
   720 * 0.67 = 483.6

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:
   720 - 483.6 = 236.4

So, Skyler's investment was approximately $236.40.

The final answer is: $236.40"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to calculate the difference between their goal and the number of signatures they already have. 

They want to reach 100 signatures, and they currently have 64 signatures. 

100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to calculate her hourly wage first. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is $20.

Next, we multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day, which is 3. So, her daily earnings would be $20 x 3 = $60.

Finally, to find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. So, we can set up a proportion to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

Let's divide 96 by 6 to find the answer.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 16 hash browns.

The correct answer is: 16"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies:
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies of all three:
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to figure out the length before the 50% extension. Let's call the original length 'x'. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140. 

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120. 

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can simply add the time taken for both modes to get the total time. 

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

First, let's add the time they've already spent walking: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. Since she bought 1 kilo, the total cost for apples is $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is $2 per kilo, so 2 x $2 = $4. She bought 2 kilos, so the total cost for bananas is $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is $3 per kilo, so 2 x $3 = $6. She bought 2 kilos, so the total cost for oranges is $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine paid a total of $14."
"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. Since Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We are also given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet ages, as you can't have a fraction of a year. 

The age of the younger triplet is 7 years old, the age of the older triplet is 14 years old, and the age of the older twin is 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time John has for homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

Next, we need to find the total cost of 10 candies. We know that Manolo bought 4 candies for $3.20, so we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost by 4:

$3.20 ÷ 4 = $0.80

Now, we can multiply the cost of one candy by 10 to find the total cost of 10 candies:

10 candies * $0.80 = $8.00

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color and add them together.

Let's start with the red squares. We know there are 14 red squares.

The blue squares are 4 more than the red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

The green squares are 6 more than the blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

The white squares are 12 fewer than the green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet."
"To find the number of regular chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs Mia needs. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so we add these numbers together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Now, we subtract the number of high chairs from the total number of chairs needed to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.

Number of chairs Mia needs to get = 57 (total needed) - 8 (high chairs) = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks. 

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of grandchildren and then multiply it by 3.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The correct answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement. 50% is the same as 0.5, so we multiply 0.5 by $2400. This gives us $1200.

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 0.2 by $2400. This gives us $480.

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck. We do this by subtracting $1200 and $480 from $2400. This gives us $720.

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so we multiply 15 by 20 to get the total number of fireworks in the city.

15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4.

0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of fireworks in her backyard.

3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard.

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total. Each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Next, we add the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. This is the combined capacity of their trucks.

When Gary joins, the total capacity becomes 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much he had initially. The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so his initial amount is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Gerald spent $10, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

The speed of the cat is given as 15 feet/second. 

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to figure out how much more money they need to raise. They've already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300.

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they're raising the same amount every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they've already worked (3 hours) to find out how much they raise per hour.

$4200 ÷ 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work.

$4200 ÷ $1400 per hour = 3 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

So, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be 14 days x $12 per day = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece will be 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each will be 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each will be 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free"". This means Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

The correct answer is 3."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is 576."
"To calculate the cost of picking blueberries, we need to add the initial cost of $20 to the cost of the blueberries themselves. Since James picked 30 pounds, we multiply the cost per pound ($1.5) by 30 pounds.

$1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $45

Adding the initial cost of $20, the total cost of picking blueberries is $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of buying blueberries at the store. The store sells them for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. So, the cost of buying blueberries at the store would be $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. 

First, we find 10% of $700. To do this, we multiply $700 by 0.1. 

$700 x 0.1 = $70

Now, we add the 10% increase to the original price. 

$700 + $70 = $770

The new price of each computer is $770. To find the total amount paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers, which is 500.

$770 x 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to find the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs in the omelet, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we need to calculate the calories from the cheese. There are 2 ounces of cheese in the omelet, and each ounce is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. There are 2 ounces of ham in the omelet, and each ounce is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

To find the total calories in the omelet, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham. So, the total calories are 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet has 770 calories."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of pencils and erasers separately.

The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.
The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

The total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since you paid $10, the change would be $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is $5."
"To find out how many people accept the job, we need to follow the given percentages step by step.

First, we find out how many people get interviews. Since 30% of 100 people apply, we multiply 100 by 0.3. This gives us 30 people who get interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who get interviews get a job offer. Since 20% of the people who get interviews get a job offer, we multiply 30 by 0.2. This gives us 6 people who get a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who get a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the people who get a job offer accept, we divide 6 by 3. This gives us 2 people who accept the position.

The answer is 2."
"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave away, we need to calculate the number of sacks she gave away and multiply it by the weight of each sack.

She gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

This week, she bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.
Last week, she bought 4 boxes.

The difference between the two weeks is 8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply by the number of minutes.

When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

Since she dances for 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes, we can calculate the total number of taps as follows:

- When her arms are down: 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
- When her arms are up: 400 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to consider the costs involved. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole. This includes the damage to Ron's car, which is $450, and the fine he would get if he doesn't fix it, which is $120. Additionally, he needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25. So, the total cost of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. 

Now, we add up all these costs: $450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $645.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the fine from the total cost: $645 - $120 = $525.

Therefore, Ron saves $525 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is: $525"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's add the total number of normal and baby chairs: 170 + 23 = 193.

Next, we'll subtract the number of chairs sent for repair: 193 - 33 = 160.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 = -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this means that the friends ate more slices than the total number of slices available. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, so the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is (9 * 30 + 9 * 20) / (2 * 9) = (270 + 180) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows smashed for students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, we calculate the number of windows smashed for teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows smashed for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64.

To find the total number of windows smashed, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars: 256 + 64 = 320.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of 5000 people voted, we multiply 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * 2/5 = 2000

Now, we subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total number of people to find the remaining people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, so we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

3000 * 2/3 = 2000

Finally, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The correct answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required. There are 9 kids who want 2 smores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each.

The total number of smores needed is 9 kids * 2 smores/kid + 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

Cindy has two math and science books that weigh 2 pounds each, so the total weight of these books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. She also has a French book that weighs 4 pounds and an English book that weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we need to calculate the votes for candidate B first. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount. 
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's start by calculating the water used for each type of cube:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books each person has. 

We know Clara has 20 books, and she has two times as many books as Steven. So, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has: 
20 / 2 = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 
10 + 6 = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 
20 - 16 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, the cost of a half-gallon jar would be $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost of 10-gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50. The cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - (10 + 15) = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds.

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Initially, there were 12 birds. After 4 were scared away, there were 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Now, the total number of birds is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on the plate. She then adds 3 more slices, bringing the total to 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Next, she triples the number of slices, resulting in 5 * 3 = 15 slices. After eating 2 slices, the plate has 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Finally, her friend steals 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals. 

There are 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. Let's add them up: 
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, we need to divide the total number of animals by 7 (the number of days in a week). 
28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

The total value of the cards Mark found is the sum of the values of the two cards and the 30 cards worth $50 each:
$4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of each amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the family.

The first amusement park charges $26 for each adult and $12 for each child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost would be:

$26 (adults) + $12 (children) = $38

The second amusement park charges $14 for each adult and $10 for each child. The total cost would be:

$14 (adults) + $10 (children) = $24

To find out how much the family can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:

$38 (first park) - $24 (second park) = $14

The family can save $14 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $14"
"So, the tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, but now he's switching to a new vendor who sells them for $0.4 each. To find out how much he saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost.

Let's do the math: 
500 tomatoes * $0.5 = $250
500 tomatoes * $0.4 = $200

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 per day.

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
$50 * 7 = $350

So, the vendor saves $350 per week."
"To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to first figure out how many marbles each of them has.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4. 
Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles they each have. 
Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: 336"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). 

However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, but the activity requires 54 students to be separated into 12 groups. This means that the 54 students are already divided into 12 groups, and no more groups are needed.

Since the students are already divided into 12 groups, the correct answer is:

$0$"
"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

Number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month: 20 weekdays * 60 chairs per weekday = 1200 chairs
Number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month: 8 weekend days * 100 chairs per weekend day = 800 chairs

Total chairs rented in a 4-week month: 1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

Since we need to find the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2:
2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events. 

First, we know Gunther initially had 48 bananas. Then, Arnold stole half of the bananas, so we divide 48 by 2 to find out how many bananas Gunther had left. 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so we add 25 to 24. 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

After that, Arnold stole 12 bananas, so we subtract 12 from 49. 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, so we add 6 to 37. 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, on the third day, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much each roommate pays per year for electricity, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates and then multiply by 12.

The total bill is $100, and there are 4 roommates. 

$100 ÷ 4 = $25 per roommate per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates, then subtract the number of broken ones.

Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken, and 6 plates were broken. So, we need to subtract these from the initial numbers.

The number of remaining glasses is 96 - 10 = 86.
The number of remaining plates is 48 - 6 = 42.

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This means she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons. So, she now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She then trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers. She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Total matches played = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, let's break it down. We know that the total number of council members is 33. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. If we let the number of votes against be x, then the number of votes in favor would be 2x.

Since the total number of votes must add up to 33, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 11.

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can easily find the number of votes in favor by multiplying 11 by 2, which gives us 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can start by identifying the number of students for each size.

Let's break it down step by step:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Since twice as many students need size small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts."
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 is 0.05 x $140 = $7.

$140 - $7 = $133

So, you will pay $133 after the discount."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

We have 20 playlists, each with 300 songs. Since each song is 10 hours long, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

First, multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist: 20 * 300 = 6000 songs
Then, multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: 60,000"
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

First, we find 20% of 50 people who think horse #2 will win. This is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find 60% of the remaining people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. This is 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The answer is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies, we know that 1/3 of them are Pomeranians, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's start by finding the total number of Pomeranians. Since 1/3 of them are girls, we can set up an equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To determine how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Adding this to the $70 he already had, we get:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

$85"
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. The first house needs half of that amount, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases.

Now, we need to find out how many cases the third house needs. Since the third house needs double the amount of the first house, we multiply the number of cases the first house needs by 2. 

So, 125 * 2 = 250 cases.

The third house needs 250 cases of shingles."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, we find 45% of 200 bananas. To do this, we multiply 200 by 0.45. 

200 * 0.45 = 90

Now, we add the result to the number of bananas: 
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. 

To find the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to multiply the number of kilograms of oranges needed for 1 liter by 4. 

5 kilograms of oranges * 4 liters = 20 kilograms of oranges

Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3 = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

The total number of books read is 600."
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Since Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns this bonus on both Monday and Wednesday. So, we add $5 * 2 = $10 to her total earnings for both days.

Total earnings for Monday and Wednesday = $300 + $60 + $10 = $370

The final answer is: $370"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20

20 - 16 = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents."
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling eggplants, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount he wants to make:
$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):
$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To find the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to calculate the total time she has available for soccer.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. She spends 3 hours reading and 3 hours playing video games. 

First, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend time to find the time spent playing soccer: 
12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

Now, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100 to find the percentage:
(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. This leaves him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we subtract the pencils he gave to Charlie from the remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. We can find the time it takes to drive to the museum by dividing the distance by the speed:

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

The total time spent driving is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time taken to drive back home:
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Finally, we add the time spent at the museum to find the total time Jack is gone from home:
Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. Next, we calculate the number of wheels for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels. 

Now, we add the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels that will be left is 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is $200. To find this, you multiply $1000 by 0.20. 

$1000 * 0.20 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:

1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

Since Mike can get these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find out how much the series would cost if they were bought individually. Since a normal movie costs $10, the series would cost:

200 * $10 = $2000

But Mike can get them for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, so we need to divide the cost by 6:

$2000 / 6 = $333.33

Next, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:

0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

Since these older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies that are not in series or older movies. Since there are 400 movies left, and 160 are older movies, we subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

These movies cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. So, we can calculate the cost of these movies:

240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33"
"To find the total amount spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

Next, we calculate the cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Lastly, we calculate the cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we can multiply the hiking speed by the time:
Distance = Hiking speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score is calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score is calculated as follows:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 
So, the total number of times for these 2 days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish. Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this scenario is not possible.

Let's try the other scenario: 14 orange fish were taken out, and 3 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 + 14 = 17 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

After adding the new fish to the pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's set up the equation:

17 = 2(1)

Since this equation is not true, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. However, 4.5 is not a whole number, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. We can try x = 4 or x = 5.

If x = 4, then 4 + x = 8, and 2(4 + x) = 2(8) = 16, which is not equal to 17.

If x = 5, then 4 + x = 9, and 2(4 + x) = 2(9) = 18, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, then 4 + x = 8, and 2(4 + x) = 2(8) = 16, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 0.5 = 5, then 4 + x = 9, and 2(4 + x) = 2(9) = 18, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 1 = 3.5, then 4 + x = 7.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(7.5) = 15, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5, then 4 + x = 9.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(9.5) = 19, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 2 = 2.5, then 4 + x = 6.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(6.5) = 13, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 2 = 6.5, then 4 + x = 10.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(10.5) = 21, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 3 = 1.5, then 4 + x = 5.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(5.5) = 11, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 3 = 7.5, then 4 + x = 11.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(11.5) = 23, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 4 = 0.5, then 4 + x = 4.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(4.5) = 9, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 4 = 8.5, then 4 + x = 12.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(12.5) = 25, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 5 = -0.5, then 4 + x = 3.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(3.5) = 7, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 5 = 9.5, then 4 + x = 13.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(13.5) = 27, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 6 = -1.5, then 4 + x = 2.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(2.5) = 5, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 6 = 10.5, then 4 + x = 14.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(14.5) = 29, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 7 = -2.5, then 4 + x = 1.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(1.5) = 3, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 7 = 11.5, then 4 + x = 15.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(15.5) = 31, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 8 = -3.5, then 4 + x = 0.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(0.5) = 1, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 8 = 12.5, then 4 + x = 16.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(16.5) = 33, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 9 = -4.5, then 4 + x = -4.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(-4.5) = -9, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 9 = 13.5, then 4 + x = 17.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(17.5) = 35, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 10 = -5.5, then 4 + x = 12.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(12.5) = 25, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 10 = 14.5, then 4 + x = 18.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(18.5) = 37, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 11 = -6.5, then 4 + x = 10.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(10.5) = 21, which is not equal to 17.

If we try x = 4.5 + 11 = 15.5, then 4 + x = 19.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(19.5) = 39, which is not equal to 17.

However, if we try x = 4.5 - 12 = -7.5, then 4 + x = 8.5, and 2(4 + x) = 2(8.5) = 17, which is equal to 17.

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is 7.5.

The final answer is 7.5."
"To figure out how much money Andy's car is using per week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week. Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day.

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate how much gas his car uses per week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so we can divide the total miles driven by the fuel efficiency to get the amount of gas used.

Gas used per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas used per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas used per week = 5 gallons

The cost of gas is $3 per gallon, so we can multiply the amount of gas used by the price to get the total cost.

Cost of gas per week = Gas used per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes is 5 * 22 = 110.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants. Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. So, the total number of eggplants is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together to get the total number of fruits. 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

John is missing $150."
"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people, and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initial number of people: 172
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

We know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. 

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the number of days in the month: 
10 * 30 = 300

Then, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 * $0.25 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
For 3 hours, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then multiply it by the salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new ones every month. So, after 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

The total number of employees after 3 months is 260.

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. To find the total salary paid, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:
260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. 
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after each raise. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings are $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since Sally also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to first calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. We add the number of each type of stuffed animal:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = 10.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals, then the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day for 14 days. 
Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days.
Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 2 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 2 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is traveling faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled:
Distance between them = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between them = 20 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the cost of the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500, which is 68% (340/500). The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100, which is 40%. The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 80 out of 400, which is 20%.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate by adding the percentages of students who passed in each grade and dividing by 3 (since there are three grades). 

Overall pass rate = (68% + 40% + 20%) / 3
= (68 + 40 + 20) / 3
= 128 / 3
= 42.67%

Since we can't have a fraction of a percentage, we can round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is not among the options."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags of glass chips by the number of chips per square inch and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of tea consumed by the four students who drank 1.5 quarts each. 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Next, we'll calculate the amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who drank 2 quarts each. 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Now, we add the amount of tea consumed by both groups. 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, bringing his total to 100 + 100 = 200 candies. However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Since Dale wants to sell all of his candies, we need to find out how many more he needs to sell. To do this, we can subtract the number of candies he has left (50) from the total number of candies he has (200). 

200 - 50 = 150

Dale still needs to sell 150 more candies to sell all of his candy."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

Let's break it down:

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number doubles to 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number doubles to 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number doubles to 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number doubles to 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number doubles to 320 students.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). This will give us the total number of branches he climbed in a week.

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many S'mores John and DeSean can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows they dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

There are 35 marshmallows in the bag initially. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 3 = 32.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 120 minutes as well, so they will also use 6 quarters.

The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the information given. 

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. We also know that the amount of salt and citrus zest are the same, and the amount of oil is twice as much as the salt. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest are the same, let's call this amount ""x"". 

The amount of oil is twice as much as the salt, so the amount of oil is 2x. The amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, which is x.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total amount of the mixture: x + x + 2x + x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Let's calculate the number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

There are 20 students working together, so we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. 

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

Since Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day by dividing the time she walked on the first day by 2.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars. To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the pay per task.

There are 5 tasks in each cycle, and John does 30 cycles a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of tasks per day by the number of days in a week to get the total number of tasks in a week.

Total tasks per day = 5 tasks/cycle * 30 cycles/day = 150 tasks/day
Total tasks in a week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Each task pays $1.20, so we can multiply the total number of tasks in a week by the pay per task to get the total weekly earnings.

Total weekly earnings = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 * 11 = 88.

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we need to use variables to represent the number of cards each person has. Let's say PJ has x cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Next, we know she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, we multiply the number of green eggs by 2 to find the number of blue eggs: 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

We also know she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. To find the number of pink eggs, we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, we're told she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find the number of yellow eggs, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, she will lose:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Milly will lose $8.

$8"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them up.

First, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs. She writes 2 hours a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so she writes 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup. She does it for 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60, so 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she does her makeup for 1.5 * 4 = 6 hours in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends writing songs and doing her makeup to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a month. 8 hours + 6 hours = 14 hours.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is: 
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to start by finding out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply Anthony's money by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Finally, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to determine the height Saskay can lift first, then the height Kagiyami can lift, and finally the height Naruto can lift.

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 4 hours, the distance covered is 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles.

For the next 6 hours, the distance covered is 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

The total distance is the sum of these two distances: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroo first. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
We know that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, so we can find the distance by multiplying the time by the speed of one kangaroo.

Distance = Speed of one kangaroo * Time for kangaroos
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108

Now we can find the time it will take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Time for turtles = 108 / 3
Time for turtles = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first determine the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them to find the total number of dishes.

Total number of dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50.

x + 230 = 350

Now, we need to solve for x.

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from both the large and small apples: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Finally, Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide 25 by the amount of milk one cow produces per day. Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. However, he already has 3 cows. To find out how many more cows he needs, we subtract the number of cows he has from the number of cows needed.

5 (cows needed) - 3 (cows he has) = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. Since the original length of the glue stick is 12 mm, we can find the length of the used part by multiplying 12 mm by 5/6, which equals 10 mm. Then, we subtract the used part from the original length to find the length of the unused part: 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. We can find the length of the used part by multiplying 12 mm by 1/3, which equals 4 mm. Then, we subtract the used part from the original length to find the length of the unused part: 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. We can find the length of the used part by multiplying 12 mm by 1/2, which equals 6 mm. Then, we subtract the used part from the original length to find the length of the unused part: 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

The total cost of the items is $10,800 (car) + $800 (phone) = $11,600.

Gabriel has $5,200 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,400.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $11,600 - $5,400 = $6,200.

So, Gabriel still needs $6,200."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we can multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2 to find Peter's socks.

30 * 2 = 60 socks

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can add the number of socks and dishes they have together:

60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find the total number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Let's start by adding the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only. This gives us 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13.

Since there are 20 students in total, we subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of students good at both math and English. 20 - 13 = 7.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both math and English (7). 5 + 7 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract that from the total time of the concert.

Each group takes 10 minutes to get on stage, perform, and exit. So, the total time taken by each group is 10 minutes.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equal to 120 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total time of the concert by the time taken by each group to find out how many groups can perform.

Number of groups = Total time of the concert / Time taken by each group

= 12

So, 12 groups can perform in the concert.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that there are 40 white shirts in total. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate the number of white shirts with collars by dividing 40 by 2, which equals 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 out of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from 50, which equals 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of white shirts with no collars (20) from the number of floral shirts with no buttons (30). The result is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. 

The total number of eggs is 900, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. 

900 ÷ 30 = 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

The total amount spent on shoes per year is $2640, and James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, James buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent per year by the number of pairs bought per year:

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with a $2 discount for each basket. 
3 * $18 = $54
Since we get $2 off for each basket of red food, we subtract $6 from the total cost:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. 

Since you are 3 years younger than your brother, your brother's age is x + 3.

You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2.

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can check if 15.6 is a valid solution by plugging it back into the original equation.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day and then add the increase in water on the third day.

The amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she sold. Since she baked 2 loaves per hour and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, we can multiply the number of loaves by 8 to get the total number of slices. 

2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves
10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we can multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to find the total amount raised.

80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

The total amount Paige raised is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to figure out how many silver coins she had. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she had 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70.

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30. This simplifies to x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students and then subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George.

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos given to the students.

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books, Anne has y books, and Sofie has z books.

We can write an equation for the first statement: z = y + 25.

We can write another equation for the second statement: y = x - 12.

We also know that together, they have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now, let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, let's substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine how much jello Greg will spend, we need to figure out how many boxes he needs to buy. Since each box makes 10 cups and he wants 120 cups for his son's party, we can divide 120 by 10 to find out how many boxes he needs.

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the price per box to find the total cost.

12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much change the seller will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones first. Since the seller bought 5 phones at $700 each, we multiply 5 by 700.

5 * 700 = 3500

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount the seller gave, which is $4000.

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he pays in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. We can calculate 40% of the total cost by multiplying 0.4 and $400.

0.4 x $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $8.00 = $16.00

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, and he wants to buy 16 of them. 

First, we multiply the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts he wants to buy:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate. 

We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3 hours). 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work (12 hours): 
$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him. 52 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles from his friend) = 80 marbles.

Next, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80 marbles. 1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total. 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left."
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since there are 10 multiple-choice questions and each is worth 1 point, we can multiply the number of questions by the point value: 10 * 1 = 10 points. However, Amy correctly answers 80% of the questions, so we need to find 80% of 10. To do this, we multiply 10 by 0.8: 10 * 0.8 = 8 points.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions and each is worth 1 point. Again, we multiply the number of questions by the point value: 20 * 1 = 20 points. Since Amy correctly answers 90% of the questions, we multiply 20 by 0.9: 20 * 0.9 = 18 points.

Lastly, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions and each is worth 5 points. We multiply the number of questions by the point value: 5 * 5 = 25 points. However, Amy correctly answers 60% of the questions, so we need to find 60% of 5. To do this, we multiply 5 by 0.6: 5 * 0.6 = 3 points.

Now, let's add up the points from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"To find out how much Isaias bought each chicken for, we need to first find out how many chickens he sold. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 300 is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

Since he sells the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he made from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. So, the total cost of the chickens he sold must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

To find out how much he bought each chicken for, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold: $7000 / 180 = $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade.

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 10 from her age in 10 years. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, a packet of chicken will cost 2 x $10 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 x $20 = $120.

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

Let's start by subtracting the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, we divide the result by 2 to find the length of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find the total number of toys given away, we add 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so together they make 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs.

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

So, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3. 

2/3 * 6 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to find the total.

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies. 

55 (initial cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies

Since she placed the rest equally into 5 jars, we divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

The final answer is 10."
"To find the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Since there are 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies. There are 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, so we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4. This gives us 25 indoor plants.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3. This gives us 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. This gives us (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We're given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121. Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The cost of the salad is $6. 
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new weekly income, we need to calculate his new hourly wage first. 

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total hours he works in a week. 

$12 (new wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to figure out how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
702 - 80 = 622

The final answer is: 622"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how much profit John makes from renting his car, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, we calculate the total hours he works in a month: 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours. Then, we multiply the total hours by his hourly wage: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750. 

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month from renting his car."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. Martha had 3x notebooks. Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2.33 = 4.67

The final answer is: 4.67"
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance by adding 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance is 50 miles. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which equals 10. So, Anis's distance is 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances. The total distance is 50 (Dijana's distance) + 60 (Anis's distance) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

Therefore, William spent $8 in total."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can find the material needed for 1 small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4 masks. This gives us 0.5 yards per small mask.

Now, we can multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by the total number of small masks (20) to find the total material needed for small masks: 0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can find the material needed for 1 large mask by dividing 2.25 yards by 3 masks. This gives us 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we can multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by the total number of large masks (8) to find the total material needed for large masks: 0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.

Finally, we can add the material needed for small and large masks to find the total material needed: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216, and Deepa has seen 9 movies, with each movie costing 3 tickets. So, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 ÷ 27 = $8.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The total number of shoe boxes left is 4 + 6 = 10."
"To find the number of books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply Sarah's number of books by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

First, we need to find 1/5 of 30, which is the number of marbles Dean gave to Jamie. 

1/5 * 30 = 6

Then, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald. 

6 + 10 = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total. 

30 - 16 = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can set up the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical 8-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sudoku puzzles. 

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, so it would take 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons:
20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons:
58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there were:
18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days. He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They spent $11 on a cake and $7 on 2 tubs of ice cream, so the total amount spent on these items is $11 + $7 = $18.

Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons, and each balloon costs $0.5, the total amount spent on balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially.

$24 / 2 = $12.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball. 

For soccer, we are given the total number of boys and girls separately, so we add those together: 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students playing soccer.

Now, we add the number of students in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to find the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

First, we find the total number of lollipops sold by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops.

Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student
= 300 lollipops

Next, we find the profit per lollipop by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. The cost price is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8.

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop to find the total profit.

Total profit = Total lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 lollipops * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. 

Larry also has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish. Additionally, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days a loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby's slices) + 4 (Josh's slices) = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):
24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to divide the total number of cups of mint tea by the number of rows. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 rows: 12 / 3 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of trips.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water first. Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 / $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs. So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday). To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 x 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 x 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

Stuffed animals: 8
Stacking rings: 9

Total number of toys already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the current total number of toys: 62

Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can write an equation to represent this:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's age and John's age. We can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

P + 10 = J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P = J - 10

Now, substitute P = J - 10 into the first equation:

(J - 10) + (J - 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3J - 20 = 100

Add 20 to both sides:

3J = 120

Divide both sides by 3:

J = 40

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Peter's age by substituting J = 40 into the equation P = J - 10:

P = 40 - 10

P = 30

So, Peter's age is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

Adding the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons, the total number of balloons is 9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. We add the distances spat by each of them: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people). So, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To figure out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Since there are 30 days in a month, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from each machine. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43,200 widgets * $6 = $259,200. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32,400 widgets * $6 = $192,000.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To calculate the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we compare the cost of the extended stay to the cost of the 24-hour stay. The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 15 goats, so the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.
There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds."
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25.

100 / 25 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows. 

Number of children in each row = 8
Number of rows = 7

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can get.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 - 58 = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). This gives us $78.75.

The total fixed charge is $40.

The cost of parts is $60.

Now, we add these three amounts together to get the total cost: $78.75 + $40 + $60 = $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount.

Money James was out = Total cost after discount - Amount made
= $90 - $200
= -$110

Since James was out of money, the answer is -$110."
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total value of each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9. 
Next, we calculate the value of the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20. 
Lastly, we calculate the value of the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The total amount Jen will earn is $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James spends swimming 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 5: Calculate the distance James swims at half the speed (1 mile per hour).
Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Distance = 8 miles

Step 6: Calculate the time James spends swimming 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find the remaining stickers, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Next, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the final total, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times. We have 6 copies of the newspaper, and Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. To find 10% of $5, we multiply 5 by 0.1, which equals $0.50. Since there are 6 copies, we multiply $0.50 by 6, which equals $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal. We have 10 copies of the newspaper, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. To find 8% of $15, we multiply 15 by 0.08, which equals $1.20. Since there are 10 copies, we multiply $1.20 by 10, which equals $12.

Now, let's add the commissions together: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age. So, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to figure out how many points Dinar scored first. Let's say Dinar scored x points. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points.

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

So, Dinar scored 15 points.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

There are 12 hours from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, which is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.
There are 3 hours from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Total minutes = 720 + 180 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

The correct answer is 60."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time.

She also woke up at 2:15 a.m. instead of 2:00 a.m. We need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and she usually wakes up at 6 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time.

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:45 a.m.

Now, we need to subtract the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time to find the time she was sleepwalking. 

10 p.m. - 3:45 a.m. = 6:15 p.m.

However, we need to convert 6:15 p.m. to minutes. 6 hours * 60 minutes = 360 minutes, and 15 minutes. So, 6:15 p.m. is equal to 360 + 15 = 375 minutes.

Now we can calculate the total minutes she slept on her bed that day. 

375 minutes - 5 minutes = 370 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital, we need to first determine the number of occupied beds. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks). 

50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted in 2 weeks.

The total number of occupied beds will be 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (added in 2 weeks) = 900 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 

Since Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know Shawna's age. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice. 

Let's denote the number of balls that Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 4x balls.

We know that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up an equation: 2x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know the number of balls carried by each person, we can find the total number of balls:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4x + 2x + x
Total balls = 7x
Substituting x = 1, we get:
Total balls = 7(1)
Total balls = 7

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day. 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes on the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is 87."
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to figure out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the number the others got, and Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, Collins must have gotten 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the number of corn chips each person got: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

First, we find 50% of $400. To do this, we multiply $400 by 0.5. This gives us $200. 

Next, we add the $200 to the cost of the supplies, which is $400. So, the total cost of the travel is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We can start by writing an equation for the total number of Pokémon caught:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A + 4A - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles."
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, she had 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at the office party. Since 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6, she got 6 brownies.

Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Total brownies = 12 (made by Greta) + 6 (from the office party) + 48 (from her friends)
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 a dozen is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18, 18 brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of racquet. 

For the synthetic gut racquets, it takes 15 minutes per racquet. Since there are 3 of them, the total time is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, we have the polyester racquets. It takes 22 minutes to string each one, and there are 5 of them. So, the total time for polyester racquets is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, we have the hybrid racquets. It takes 18 minutes to string each one, and there are 4 of them. So, the total time for hybrid racquets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the racquets: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones) is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Carlton's team has 13 players, we add 7 to this number to find the number of players in Zeke's team. 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we find out how many oranges she gave to her mom and sister. Since she gave 2 boxes to each of them, that's 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. With 20 oranges in each box, that's 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, we know she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find 1/4 of 240, we can divide 240 by 4, which equals 60 oranges.

So far, we have 240 - 80 (given away) - 60 (kept) = 100 oranges left.

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39. Since Tyler has saved $14, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much more he needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to figure out how many cherries Richard has first. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item he sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150
Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $90 = $180

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $180 = $330

The final answer is: $330"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32 / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

The price of the red car = $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. 

We know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. We can set up an equation based on this information: 24 = D/2.

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, we can set up another equation: 24 = 2B. To solve for B, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now that we know the current ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12), we can find the sum of their ages by adding them together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is 79."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The total number of beads Adrianne has is 90."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot to get 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between each plant from the total length of the bed. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches. Subtracting this from the total length, we get 1332 - 18 = 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 1314 / 12 = 109.5. Since we can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63 pretzels per week

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias is 5 baskets times 3 petunias per basket, which equals 5 * 3 = 15 petunias. Since each petunia costs $3.00, the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

The cost of sweet potato vines is 5 baskets times 2 vines per basket, which equals 5 * 2 = 10 vines. Since each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines, which is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Since each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil and they're planting 4 sunflowers, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations. Since each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil and they're planting 10 carnations, the total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they bought a 30-pound bag of soil, we subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 is $500. Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp.

90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp: 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 18."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was off for 2 hours, so it warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. 

Let's say the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is x. Then, Bill saw the comet x + 75 years after his dad saw it. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was 90 years old, so we can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 15. This means 15 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet.

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet: 30 + 15 = 45 years old.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3 * 45 = 135 years old.

So, Bill was 135 - 75 = 60 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 1 check. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, so that's 1 more check. Additionally, he writes 2 checks to the church every month. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service 4 times a year, which is equivalent to 1 check per month.

Total checks per month: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) + 1 (pest and lawn) = 5 checks

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total checks per month by 12: 5 checks/month * 12 months/year = 60 checks/year

The final answer is 60."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to break down the information given. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice the average age, we can calculate her age as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"So, Walter starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors and then $1500 from an online fund. To find out how much he has collected so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total amount collected, so the new total is $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Finally, Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the new total amount, which is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide 750 by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To divide the watermelon among the family, we need to figure out the number of slices each person gets. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's say the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's say the size of a kid's slice is y. Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, the total size is:

2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y

Now, we know that the total size of the watermelon is 10y, and we want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total size of the adult slices is 2(2y) = 4y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, divide the size of the adult slices by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

So, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

First, we calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds. Since there are 9 inpatients and each takes 20 minutes, we multiply 9 by 20 to get 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. There are 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes, so we multiply 10 by 30 to get 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing 480 by 60, which equals 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent (8 hours) from the total hours available (9 hours) to find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

The time it takes to make the cake is 20 minutes to make the batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool the cake, and 10 minutes to frost the cake. 

First, let's convert the 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Now, we can add up the total time:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to figure out how many boxes were sold in total and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. To find the total number of boxes, we add these two numbers together:

3.5 + 4.5 = 8

Now, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total chocolate bars sold = Number of boxes sold * Number of chocolate bars per box
64 = 8 * x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons for a month.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75. To find the monthly cost, we multiply this by 4, which gives us $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Multiplying this by 4 gives us the monthly cost of the students' lessons, which is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $60 = $360.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360.

$360"
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we need to first determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes: 64 ÷ 4 = 16.

Similarly, Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes: 56 ÷ 7 = 8.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks. 

Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14

Next, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks to find the number of yellow sticks.

Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed x time = 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed x time = 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles

To find the difference, subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means 3/4 of them are female. So, the number of female students over 16 is 3/4 * 1500 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run. 

First, we know Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we add 4 to Bethany's laps: 10 + 4 = 14 laps for Trey. 

Next, we find out how many laps Shaelyn can run. Since she runs half as many laps as Trey, we divide Trey's laps by 2: 14 / 2 = 7 laps for Shaelyn. 

Lastly, we determine how many laps Quinn can run. Since she runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, we subtract 2 from Shaelyn's laps: 7 - 2 = 5 laps for Quinn.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's recheck the calculation for the first 5 hours. We can set up an equation:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, let's try to find the initial charge. If the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, we can set up an equation:
100% - (9% * 5) + x = 28%
100% - 45% + x = 28%
55% + x = 28%
x = -27%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's try a different approach. Let's assume the initial charge is y%. Then, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
y% - (9% * 5) = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
y% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
y% - 45% - 21% = 28%
y% - 66% = 28%
y% = 94%

So, the initial charge of the power bank is 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar only has $10, we need to subtract the total amount spent from his earnings. 

$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

However, since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. It seems Jamaar actually overspent. To find out how many plums he can buy, we need to subtract the total amount spent from his earnings.

Let's re-calculate the total amount spent on other fruits: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar only has $10, we can subtract the total amount spent from his earnings.

$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

Since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we need to subtract the total amount spent from his earnings, but in this case, he actually doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs of 60 pieces each, she kept a total of 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces she gave away. Since there are 15 packs in total and she kept 2, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away (780) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes ÷ 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads:

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

The hotel initially had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76. Next, 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91. Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is 98."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she's sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy questions there are. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we multiply 60 by 0.4:
60 * 0.4 = 24

The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult. So, we subtract the easy questions from the total:
60 - 24 = 36

Now, we divide the remaining questions by 2 to find out how many average and difficult questions there are:
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She's also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is x. Then, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. So, we can set up an equation: x = 4.

Now, let's say Teresa sold y large stuffed animals and 2y small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 3x * y, and the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y.

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount earned: 3x * y + 8y = 120.

Substituting x = 4, we get: 3(4) * y + 8y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12y + 8y = 120.

Combine like terms: 20y = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: y = 6.

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs.

The twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 10 eggs that were not found by the friends.

So, the total number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

There are 30 days in a month, so the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich. We know that the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so we can calculate the price per sandwich by dividing the total cost by the number of sandwiches. 

$3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can use this price per sandwich to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches. 

$1.50 per sandwich × 8 sandwiches = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom.

Tom initially spent $3000 on the bedroom set. He then sold his old bedroom for $1000, which he uses to pay for part of the bedroom set. So, the remaining amount he owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - 6 = 6.

Sally then found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons. So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To figure out the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider a few different scenarios.

First, let's think about what happens if the normal teacher comes in. There's a 50% chance that she'll be there, and if she is, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension. So, the chance that she'll be there and not give an extension is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3. 

Next, let's think about what happens if the substitute teacher comes in. There's a 50% chance that she'll be there, and if she is, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension. So, the chance that the substitute teacher will be there and not give an extension is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

Now, we need to add up the chances of these two scenarios: 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 60%.

Final answer: 60%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending. 

First, we add the seats taken by graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250.

Now, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity: 6000 - 1250 = 4750.

There are 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates: 4750 / 950 = 5.

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then find out how many medium beans he can eat, and finally find out how many small beans he can eat.

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans he can eat by multiplying 75 by 2. This gives us 150 medium beans.

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans, we can multiply the number of medium beans by 3. So, 150 medium beans x 3 = 450 small beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans."
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Melissa is paid $15 per day and has to pay $3 for parking each day. So, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she works for 6 hours a day, we multiply her daily income after expenses by the number of hours she works: $12 * 6 = $72.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total jury pay by the total hours worked: $72 ÷ 6 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box and then divide by the number of apples in each pack.

We have 2 boxes with 40 apples in each box. So, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack, which is 8. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 x $11 = $22.
Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"So, Jim is going to college to make more money. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years. Before college, he made $25,000 a year. After college, his income tripled to $75,000 a year.

First, let's figure out how much money Jim lost while he was in school. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years, so he lost a total of $200,000.

Now, let's calculate how much money Jim made after college. He made $25,000 a year before, and his degree made his income triple, so he made $75,000 a year after college. Since he worked for 4 years, he made a total of $300,000.

To find out how much money Jim needs to make to pay off the loans and the money he lost while in school, we add the two amounts together: $200,000 (lost money) + $50,000 (loans) = $250,000.

To figure out how long it will take Jim to make this amount, we divide the total amount by his new income: $250,000 ÷ $75,000 = 3.33 years.

The answer is 3.33 years."
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

"So, Johnny's dad took him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

To find the total amount lost, we need to calculate how much he won and lost in each race. 

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. 

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country: 
26 * 5 = 130

Then, we multiply the result by the population of each city: 
130 * 1000 = 130,000

So, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches, which can be converted to just inches by multiplying the feet by 12 and adding the inches: 4 * 12 = 48 + 3 = 51 inches. 

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the amount the first person took, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total amount is $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took x + 80, and the third person took 2(x + 80). The sum of their amounts is x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80). This sum should equal the total amount, $1920.

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: 3x + 160 = 1920.

Subtract 160 from both sides: 3x = 1760.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 1760 / 3.

x = 586.67.

The first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To find the total hours worked by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8 of a day every day, we can convert this to hours by multiplying 3/8 by 24 hours. 

3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 7 days. 

9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters. There are 4 painters, so we divide 63 hours by 4.

63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours per painter

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We also know that in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is 19. We can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.

Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.

Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. Half of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the books are written in German, so there are 10% of 50 = 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

Let's do the math:

1955 (total distance) - 325 (distance driven) = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the total gallons:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, we start with 120 people on the train. Then, 20 more people board at the first stop, making the total 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people get off, and 100 more people get on. So, we subtract 50 from 140 and add 100, which gives us 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

Finally, at the third stop, 80 more people get off, leaving us with 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the running shorts. Since they cost $5 more than the tank top, and the tank top costs $10, the running shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the tennis shoes. The original price of the shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

We also know that Alison bought a package of athletic socks for $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. So, the cost of the socks is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot.

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. The total cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost.

$192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. So, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

We can do this by dividing 720 by 60.

720 ÷ 60 = 12

So, the cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Let's say Jake ate x slices. Then, Becky ate x + 3 slices. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long Betsy's part of the meal took, we need to figure out how long Donovan's part took and then add 18 minutes to it. Let's call Donovan's part ""x"". Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can say Betsy's part is x + 18.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can set up an equation: x + (x + 18) = 98. 

To solve for x, we first combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98. Then, we subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80. Finally, we divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200. The doctor charges $300 for a 30-minute visit, so we need to calculate the cost per hour. Since the visit is 30 minutes, we can divide $300 by 0.5 hours to get the hourly rate, which is $600 per hour. For 2 hours of parking, the cost is $6 per hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 (cast) + $600 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $832

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $832."
"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 x 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 x 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. First, we find twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. Then, we find 80% of 40, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, we can multiply 700 by 2 to get the number of big coupons.

Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400

Now, we can calculate the cost of each type of coupon. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and each big coupon costs 15 cents.

Cost of small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents
Cost of big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small and big coupons together.

Total cost of postage = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100.

Total cost of postage = 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars

The total cost of postage is $245."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. We know that he ordered 3 less than ten, so we subtract 3 from 10. This gives us 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many are left, we subtract 4 from 7, which gives us 7 - 4 = 3.

After that, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. So, we add 3 to the 3 remaining sub sandwiches, giving us a total of 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we multiply the total number of sub sandwiches (6) by 4 to find the total number of meatballs. This gives us 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is 24."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

There were 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. We know that 5 trucks could not deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is 20 - 5 = 15.

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the promotion.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy, we divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to determine the number of guests first. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 21 additional guests, we multiply 21 by $6 to find the cost for these extra guests.

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the initial rental fee to the cost of the additional guests to find the total cost.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * 60 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 3 monkeys, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of bananas eaten in a week:

10x + 14x + y = 315

where x is the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys and y is the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey.

We know that the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 70 (10 * 7) and 98 (14 * 7), but we can also calculate it as 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168. However, we can use the equation to find y.

10x + 14x + y = 315
24x + y = 315

Since we know that the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 168, we can substitute x with 7 (10 * 7 = 70 and 14 * 7 = 98) in the equation:

24 * 7 + y = 315
168 + y = 315

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 315 - 168
y = 147

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats:
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, if we assume she has enough money, we can calculate the change:
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses.

The correct answer is: She will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30.

Now, we add the total sales from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can set up the equation:

$2666.67 * 1.20 = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price.

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

Since the friend paid more than the original price, the percentage discount is actually a percentage increase. To find the correct percentage, we can subtract the percentage increase from 100:

Percentage discount = 100 - 20
Percentage discount = 80%

The correct answer is 80%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 times the number created by one spring in 4 hours, which is 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice that amount is 2 * 90 = 180. Adding 15 to this gives us 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, we multiply the number of bananas by the cost per banana. Jenny bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas in each bunch, so she bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The total cost of buying bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost of buying bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to figure out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.

The growth rate per year is 8 inches, and we want to find the growth in 13 years. 

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. If 8 inches is the growth in 4 years, then we can divide 13 by 4 to find the multiplier for 13 years.

13 years / 4 years = 3.25

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year (8 inches) by the multiplier (3.25).

8 inches/year * 3.25 = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to know the prices of each type of bike and the number of each type sold.

The price of a Trekking bike is $450, and the price of an MTB is $500. Since the price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, it's $250.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in a month. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 150 bikes. 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

John attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

John also spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10). This will give us the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

Let's start with the Allosaurus, which ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, we can set up an equation. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 + 540 = 1620 kilograms.

Final answer: 1620"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

So, the likelihood is 1/10 or 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. There are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people. So, the total number of people in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people. So, the total number of people in the cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars. So, the total number of people is 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. So, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Next, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age: 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch is 30 minutes, and time for breaks is 2 * 15 minutes, which equals 30 minutes. Adding these together, we get 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60. 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, so we multiply the total time per day by 5. 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance by multiplying Amber's distance by 3.5.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three.

Total distance run by all three = 52 miles
Distance run by Amber = 8 miles
Distance run by Micah = 28 miles

Distance run by Ahito = Total distance - (Distance run by Amber + Distance run by Micah)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00. Adding this to the new balance after the return, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5.

We're told that a third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15. We're also told that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color.

Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2. This gives us Ben's age as 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3. This gives us Caroline's age as 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to know how much she needs to save for her retirement. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current salary, we can calculate how much she needs to save.

Lauren's current salary is $100,000. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000. So, she needs to save $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000.

Since Lauren saves 20% of her income, we can calculate how much she saves each year. 20% of $100,000 is $20,000. 

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $60,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

$60,000 / $20,000 = 3 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 3 more years to save enough for her retirement.

Final Answer: 3"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of equal parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into.

First, we divide 100 cm by 4: 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

Then, we divide 25 cm by 5: 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the soil is $26. Let's add them together: $19 + $26 = $45.

However, we need to subtract the discount of $7 from the total. So, $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to add up the heights of all the heels and then divide by the total number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.

There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 heels in total (3 of 4 inches and 3 of 2 inches). To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels:

18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we can divide the total miles by the number of days.

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract 125 from 310.

310 - 125 = 185

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Then, we add the increase in temperature: -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is -3."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21. He then saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32. After spending $5 on a comic book, he has $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, after spending $19 on a puzzle, he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to figure out how much money Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the time it takes for the light to blink once, we can divide 5 minutes by 255.

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times."

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can multiply 10 by 7 to get the total distance she will cover in 7 days.

10 * 7 = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks.

70 / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. 

First, we calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so they make 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so they make 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. 

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys. 

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys. 

The fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys. 

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis received half of the stickers from Seth and then gave half of those to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to get the speed of the 2nd fastest car: 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the 2nd fastest car's speed is 600 Miles per hour. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so we multiply 600 by 1.25 to get the speed of the faster car: 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

2x = 14

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. We can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, we can write two equations: C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

Since C = S + 12, we can substitute this into the first equation, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately.

First, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to get the number of boxes.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:
Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we can divide the total weight of the crayons by 16 to get the weight in pounds:
Total weight of crayons = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the number of logs he can make and then the number of planks from each log, and finally the total amount he earns.

First, we find 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet, the number of logs he can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

Next, we find the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5, which is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank, which is $1.2. So, 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate each person's salary first.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, which is 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. To find their combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Then, their mother earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Let's call the speed on the beach 'x'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

We know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We also know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk and the time it takes to walk on the beach:

40 + 30/x = total time

We also know that the total distance is 3 miles, so we can set up another equation:

2 + 1 = 3

This equation is true, so we can use the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach and the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk to find the value of x.

We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach and the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

(2/x) * 60 + (1/(2x)) * 60 = 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120/x + 30/x = 3

Combine like terms:

150/x = 3

Multiply both sides by x:

150 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

50 = x

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = 30/x = 30/50 = 0.6 minutes

Now we can find the total time:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 0.6
Total time = 40.6 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{40.6}$"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to calculate how much she has already saved. Since she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, we can multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks she has already saved.

$4 x 8 = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save.

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take.

$28 ÷ $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8 blue birds. Lastly, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to figure out how many marbles he will have after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. If he receives 24 marbles and ends up with 60, we can find the initial number of marbles by subtracting 24 from 60.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob has 36 marbles initially.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and then he can drink the water.

Let's assume the unknown temperature is x degrees. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce.

We know that the total amount of water is 5 ounces, so the amount of water in the other mug is 1 ounce. This means the temperature of the water in the other mug is also 1 ounce.

We also know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, and the temperature of the water in the other mug is x degrees. The average temperature of the water is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature of the water is at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, 20 cows and 10 chickens are added. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

The total number of cows added in 21 days is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The total number of chickens added in 21 days is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The total number of cows after 3 weeks is 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows. The total number of chickens after 3 weeks is 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To find the cost of each bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell pays. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes are needed for 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
6 - 3 = 3 scoops
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we are told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
Since 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, we can divide 18 scoops by 2 to find out how many scoops of potatoes Gomer ate.
18 / 2 = 9 scoops

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops, so we can multiply 9 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.
9 * 3 = 27 potatoes

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 x 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we need to first find the total number of women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the number of men is 5 parts, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 84

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 16.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16. 

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 16 = 80. 

The number of women is 9x = 9 * 16 = 144, but we know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation:

9x + 5x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now we know that the number of women is 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 100 rocks, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total amount he earns is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total earnings: $500 - $420 = $80.

So, Adam loses $80."

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many seashells each person collected.

Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Carlos collected x seashells. Then, Jim collected x + 5 seashells.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey collected y seashells. Then, we can set up the equation:

22 = 2y

Solving for y, we get:

y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

Dividing 60 seashells equally among the three people, we get:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and the number of babies wearing blue. Since there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 of them are wearing purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies. The remaining 1/4 are wearing blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple wearers and all the blue wearers are wearing bows. So, the number of purple bow wearers is 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies, and the number of blue bow wearers is 2 babies.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2 (purple bow wearers) + 2 (blue bow wearers) = 4 babies.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple bow wearers by the total number of bow wearers: 2 / 4 = 0.5, which is equivalent to 50%.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land, we need to break it down step by step.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. A quarter of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

So, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

Abraham initially earned $50 + $30 = $80 from the first two sales. He then earned an additional $60 from the last sale. In total, he earned $80 + $60 = $140.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can multiply the number of face masks he changes per day by the number of times he goes out in a day.

So, 2 face masks/day * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the total number of apartments from all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits it produces each year.

In the first year, the tree produces 50 fruits. In the second year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. In the third year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits. This pattern continues for the next few years.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100 and add it to the $100 Jack already had.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, we can express the length of the blue rope as Y - 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express the length of the red rope as 4(Y - 7).

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. This gives us the equation Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Let's simplify this equation by combining like terms: 
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie. Since Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister.

1/5 of $15 is $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Now, Rissa had $15 and gave $3 to her sister. So, she is left with $15 - $3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie didn't give any money to her sister, she still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is $5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are four colors of paint in the mural: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say that the amount of each of these colors is the same. Let's call this amount 'x'. The amount of yellow paint is also 'x', but we know that half the mural is yellow. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is half of 12, which is 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

Now, we know that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors. So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the total number of clouds counted across all five days:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to calculate the cost of one pod and then divide $1 by that cost.

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods. So, the new box has 120 pods.

The cost of one pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod to find out how many cycles you can run:

$1 ÷ $0.12 = 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since $1000 / $20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Then, Thomas triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals."
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45

Since 0.45 is equal to the amount of chalk used on Monday, we can set up an equation:

0.20 * (2.25 - 0.45x) = 0.45

Simplifying the equation:

0.20 * 2.25 - 0.20 * 0.45x = 0.45

0.45 - 0.09x = 0.45

Subtracting 0.45 from both sides:

-0.09x = 0

Dividing both sides by -0.09:

x = 5

So, the teacher will have 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the number of students on varsity and subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. 

The number of girls on varsity is 1/3 * 12 = 4. 
The number of boys on varsity is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate how many face masks Mike bought and then multiply that by 3 and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. Thrice as many as Mike is 3 * 5 = 15. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, so he bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than the number drilled, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100.

So, the percentage of teeth fixed is (15/30) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the refund, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is equal to (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons. 

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

The final answer is $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we let W be Wendy's current age and C be Colin's current age, we can write an equation based on this information:

W = 5(C + 7)

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3C + 75 = W

Now we have two equations:

W = 5(C + 7)
3C + 75 = W

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

3C + 75 = 5(C + 7)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54

Since Bob has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get.

54 ÷ 3 = 18

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out how many books each school can get.

18 × 100 = 1800

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he put 6 apples in his pocket and threw 1 apple back into the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags. 

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Since each bag costs $18, we can multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

6 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 14 pizzas

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The nurses start with an unknown number of bandages. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

Therefore, the nurses started with 93 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 93"
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and add it to the cost of the color.

First, we find the difference in length of her hair. She started with 10 inches and ended with 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total is now 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is now 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it's 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50

"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. The height of the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, we divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. 8 / 4 = 2.

So, the last dog needs 2 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off debts.

First, we need to find 40% of the house's value. 40% of $250,000 is 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000. This is the amount John borrowed.

Next, we need to find 60% of the loan amount to determine how much he used to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.

To find out how much money John had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount. $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The final answer is: $64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines first. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is 29."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

The total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack, which equals 300 balloons. Since 12 balloons are left, we can calculate the number of balloons thrown by subtracting 12 from 300.

300 - 12 = 288

Therefore, 288 balloons were thrown."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first find the amount of each medicine in one dose.

The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, the total amount of medicine is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has 2 classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 1/8 * 120 = 15
John's school capacity = 2 * 15 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. 

Half of 10 diaper changes is 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the percentage difference. We can do this by dividing the difference by the true number and multiplying by 100: (765 / 900) * 100 = 85%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85}$"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps below:

The bus had 20 people initially. Then, 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, making the total number of people on the bus 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This means 3/4 of 40 people entered, which is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. This means the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100.

$100"
"To find the length of the longer piece, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. This means the longer piece is 4x.

Since the total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to figure out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy, we need to calculate the total width of all the windows and then multiply it by 2.

There are 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. So, the total width is:

5 * 35 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2:

175 * 2 = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made. Let's start by using the information that each person gets two treats and there are 5 people in the class. This means the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.

Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, we can represent the number of cupcakes as 'x'. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, so we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we need to calculate the discount first. The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we calculate the price in December after an 80% increase from the initial price of $40. This is done by adding 80% of $40 to the initial price. 80% of $40 is 0.8 * $40 = $32. So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, we calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease from the price in December. 50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36. So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

First, we calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons. He charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount he earns from the standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

Next, we calculate the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans. He reduces his rate by 25%, so his reduced rate is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount he earns from the lessons with veterans is:
2 * $60 = $120

The total amount Charlie will make for the day is the sum of the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total score by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it as follows:

Let's denote the original amount as x. We know that 1/4 of x is equal to 5. We can set up the equation:

1/4x = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 5 * 4
x = 20

Now that we know Eve originally had 20 pomelos, we can find out how many she gave away by subtracting the amount left from the original amount:

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating 2/5 of them and giving 25% to his sister.

First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. We know that 2/5 of 60 apples is the same as (2 * 60) / 5. 

(2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Walter ate 24 apples, so the remaining number of apples is 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. 25% of 36 apples is (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples.

The remaining number of apples is 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

If Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up an equation to find the total number of novels she wrote this year. Let's call the total number of novels she wrote this year ""x"". Since 3 quarters of x is equal to 9, we can write the equation as:

(3/4)x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Since he is traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

The number of sick teachers is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 13 + 9 = 22."
"To find the total amount Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 52.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00. Adding the cost of pasta, the total weekly cost is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520"
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to figure out how many books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. So, the total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since there are 100 hats in total, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. We're told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test).

70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct. Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

To find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test, we can calculate 35 as a percentage of the total questions on the second test, which is 40.

35 questions is 35/40 = 0.875 or 87.5% of the total questions on the second test.

So, Audrey needs to get 87.5% of the questions on the second test correct to pass."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

The number of games played per year is 40, and she has been playing for 4 years. To find the total number of games played, we multiply the number of games played per year by the number of years:

Total games played = 40 * 4
Total games played = 160

Since Ara scores 21 points per game, we can multiply the total number of games played by the points scored per game to find the total points scored:

Total points scored = Total games played * Points scored per game
Total points scored = 160 * 21
Total points scored = 3360

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"Let's break down the situation step by step. Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which means he lost 5 marbles. This leaves him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing his total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Finally, he found 1 item that wasn't a marble, but he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, so he still has 8 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Next, we need to find out how many potential customers Jason needs to get to get 15 customers. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Finally, we need to find out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers. Since for every 25 phone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls to get 30 potential customers.

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16.
The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The answer is: 44"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we calculate the total number of chips: 2 bags * 55 chips per bag = 110 chips.

Now, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find out how many chips each person gets.

110 ÷ 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time it takes for each side. The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they each take 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to figure out how many calls he makes in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many calls he deals with in an hour.

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Since Tim works 6 hours a day, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per hour by the number of hours he works per day.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with per day by the number of days he works per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the time it would take for each varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so on 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so on 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish."
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This is 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the land distance and the water distance separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

The land distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.
The water distance is also 100 yards.

Time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
Time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Total time taken = 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we need to divide the total number of sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8). This will give us the number of boxes Bob needs to purchase.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box:

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since it's mentioned that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can find the cost of each additional phone by dividing the cost of the main phone by 2. 

$20 / 2 = $10

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of these phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

To find the total cost of the whole phone plan, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June and then multiply it by the price per doughnut.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

We know that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. So, the total number of photos she uploads per day is 7 * 6 = 42.

Now, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 42

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 42
= 5

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00
Then, we calculate the cost of the skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, we add the costs together: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

So, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

The final answer is: $47"
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speaking speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days left, we can calculate the total number of people for those days as 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To find the total number of kernels popped, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each time interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. Then, in the next 30 seconds, 3 times that amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add the total number of kernels popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is 210."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to figure out how many lemons are required for 5 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons needed for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of each breed. German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 of them, so 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms. Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 of them, so 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms. To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs. There are 10 two-legged animals, which have 2 legs each, so they contribute 10 * 2 = 20 legs. There are 15 four-legged animals, which have 4 legs each, so they contribute 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total legs together: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first find the total number of blue and yellow blocks. We know that there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

The distance for the first part of the journey (west) is 18 miles per hour times 5 hours, which equals 90 miles. 

The distance for the second part of the journey (east) is 18 miles per hour times 8 hours, which equals 144 miles.

The total distance traveled is 90 miles plus 144 miles, which equals 234 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.

The net distance is 144 miles minus 90 miles, which equals 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First, we calculate the depreciation for the first year. The boat depreciated by 30% of its initial value. The initial value is $9000. 30% of $9000 is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30% of its value. 30% of $6300 is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20% of its value. 20% of $4410 is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.
10% of $80 = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets is calculated by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost of an adult ticket, and then adding the cost of a child ticket. In this case, 2 adult tickets cost 2 x $12 = $24, and 1 child ticket costs $8. So, the total cost of the tickets is $24 + $8 = $32.

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns. Since they bought 2 popcorns at $3 each, the total cost of the popcorns is 2 x $3 = $6.

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost. So, the total cost is $32 + $6 = $38.

The family pays a total of $38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight is:

1200 + 250 + (2 * 75) = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)

In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma and Mia is 40 years old, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by each person and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

First, let's add the number of seashells found by each person: 
214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells: 
732 - 67 = 665

So, the total number of good seashells is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the dinner plates. Since there are 12 people and each dinner plate costs $6.00, we multiply 12 by $6.00 to get the total cost of the dinner plates.

12 * $6.00 = $72.00

Next, we calculate the cost of the bowls. There are 12 people and each bowl costs $5.00, so we multiply 12 by $5.00 to get the total cost of the bowls.

12 * $5.00 = $60.00

Now, we calculate the cost of the salad plates. There are 12 people and each salad plate costs $4.00, so we multiply 12 by $4.00 to get the total cost of the salad plates.

12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Finally, we add the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates together to get the total cost of the place settings.

$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to calculate half of Steve's time first. 

Steve's time is 10 hours. Half of that is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we add 2 hours to the half of Steve's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of hot dogs John needs, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs required for the party. 

There are 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. To find out how many hot dogs he needs to buy, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so that's 20 * $2 = $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 * $1 = $40. Adding these together, we get $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays of cupcakes for $4 each, so that's 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income: $80 - $20 = $60.

Frances has $60 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we start with 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. To find the total number of children, we can multiply the number of children on the second street (10) by 2, then add the original 10 children. This gives us 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. To find the total number of children remaining, we subtract the original 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16.

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 
12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 840 minutes / 60 = 14 hours.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 5 hours * 4 = 20 hours.

First, let's calculate the area of each type of shirt:
- Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
- Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
- Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To find Jackie's height before the summer, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The final answer is 67."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in that time period.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in two weeks, there are 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar: 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts, Jake pays full price for the first one and 50% off for the second one. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, Jake gets a 40% discount on the original price of $40. The discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are $6 * 3 = $18. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is $1.25 * 4 = $5. Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we can divide $13 by $6.50 to find out how many tickets he can buy. 

$13 / $6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount she spent is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total cost of the bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

To find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add their individual totals: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to first find the total cost of making one jar. 

The cost of the ingredients for one jar is as follows:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. There are 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have 95 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Then, there are 120 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. So, 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Lastly, we have 750 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15. 

Now, we add the cost of the ice cream and the bracelet: $3.50 + $8.50 = $12.

Total amount spent = $12 + $15 = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40.

Amount left = $40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Randy now has a total of 6 + 7 + 6 = 19 cookies."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 7 = $42

Total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first.

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Let's do the math:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

He had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29 (total items).

However, we know that Igor lost some beakers, so we need to subtract the number of beakers he had from the total number of beakers he should have had. Let's call the number of beakers he lost 'x'. Then, the correct number of beakers is 7 - x.

We can set up the equation: 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 31 - x = 29.

Solving for x, we get: x = 2.

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the eggs from both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances. We know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. 

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can find her distance by multiplying Aaron's distance by 2.

Vanessa's distance = 2 * Aaron's distance
Vanessa's distance = 2 * 2
Vanessa's distance = 4 miles

Now that we know Vanessa's distance, we can find her speed by dividing the time it took Aaron by his distance, and then multiplying that result by Vanessa's distance.

Aaron's speed = 16 minutes / 2 miles
Aaron's speed = 8 minutes per mile

Vanessa's speed = Aaron's speed * Vanessa's distance
Vanessa's speed = 8 minutes per mile * 4 miles
Vanessa's speed = 32 minutes per mile

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time by multiplying her speed by her distance.

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 miles * 32 minutes per mile
Time = 128 minutes

The final answer is 128."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3 to get the total length of line required.

200 * 3 = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total meals per night is 6 * 2 = 12 meals. Each meal costs $5, so the total cost of meals per night is 12 * $5 = $60. Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65.

Now, let's multiply the daily revenue by 2 to get the weekly revenue. $65 * 2 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per watermelon and then add a 25% profit.

First, let's find the cost per watermelon. We know the vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 

Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we'll calculate 25% of the cost per watermelon and add it to the cost.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price = $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find the current age of James, we need to know Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we subtract 3 from 12 to get her current age: 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we multiply Dora's age by 2 to get James' age: 9 * 2 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. They start peeling oranges at the same time.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges. In the third minute, Ana will peel x - 2 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges, and so on.

We can see that Ana peels one less orange in each minute, while Jane peels the same number of oranges in each minute.

To find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane after an hour (60 minutes), we need to find the difference in the number of oranges they peel in 60 minutes.

Ana peels x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + ... + 1 oranges in 60 minutes. This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of 1, and 60 terms.

Jane peels x + x + x + ... + x oranges in 60 minutes. This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of x, and 60 terms.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Since the series for Ana and Jane are the same, the difference is 0.

Final Answer: $0$"
"To find the cost of the new radiator, Mark gets 80% off the original price of $400. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 
So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final cost Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The number of cows is 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices."
