"So, Janet has 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, which means she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs. 

She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

The answer is $18."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. The amount of white fiber is half of the blue fiber, so it's 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find out how many meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, we multiply 3 by 60.

3 * 60 = 180

James runs 180 meters per week."
"To find out how much feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed she gave them in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gave her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gave them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed she gave them so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total daily feed needed. 

40 cups * 20 chickens = 800 cups

Since Wendi has already given the chickens 40 cups of feed, we subtract this from the total daily feed to find the amount needed for the final meal.

800 cups - 40 cups = 760 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{760}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"So, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we need to add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This takes 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download takes 20 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 80 minutes (second download) = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To find out how far John is from home, we need to break down his journey into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. We can find the distance by multiplying the speed and time: 60 * 3 = 180 miles. This means he is 180 miles away from home.

Then, he stops for 2 hours, so he doesn't move. This doesn't change his distance from home.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. We can find the distance by multiplying the speed and time: 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. This means he is now 180 + 15 = 195 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 miles per hour. We can find the distance by multiplying the speed and time: 80 * 2 = 160 miles. This means he is now 195 - 160 = 35 miles away from home.

So, John is 35 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is 35."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to multiply the overtime pay rate by the number of overtime hours. The overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10. So, the overtime pay rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12.

The number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54 downloads. So, the downloads in the third month are 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. There are 12 donuts in a dozen, so 3 dozen donuts is 3 x 12 = 36 donuts. Each dozen donuts costs $68, so 36 donuts will cost 36 x $68 = $2444. However, I will round this to $244.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 12 cupcakes in a dozen, so 2 dozen cupcakes is 2 x 12 = 24 cupcakes. Each dozen cupcakes costs $80, so 24 cupcakes will cost 24 x $80 = $1920. However, I will round this to $1920.

Lastly, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. There are 12 cheesecakes in a dozen, so 6 dozen cheesecakes is 6 x 12 = 72 cheesecakes. Each dozen cheesecakes costs $55, so 72 cheesecakes will cost 72 x $55 = $3960. However, I will round this to $3960.

Now, let's add the costs together: $244 + $1920 + $3960 = $8124.

The total cost is $8124."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to think about the costs and the income.

The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, it grows 7 lemons, and Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.50. However, it costs him $3 to water and feed the tree every year.

Let's calculate the net profit each year. The tree makes $10.50 from selling lemons ($7 lemons * $1.50 per lemon) and spends $3 on expenses. So, the net profit is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start making money, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit. $90 (initial cost) ÷ $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We need to find out how many vacuum cleaners she started with.

Let's say Melanie had x vacuum cleaners initially. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she had (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners. This means she had (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Now, we can add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

First, we find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students. 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students. 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12. To find the percentage, we divide 12 by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100. This gives us (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is 60."
"So, there are two options: a necklace worth $5,000 or some electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The person who is helping me think about this says that the necklace will go up in value by 2.5% and the gadgets will go up by 1.2% in the same month. I need to choose the option that will make me the most money.

To do this, I need to calculate how much more money I'll have for each option. 

For the necklace: $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125. So, the necklace will be worth $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.
For the gadgets: $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96. So, the gadgets will be worth $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since $8,096 is more than $5,125, I should choose the gadgets. 

The profit from the gadgets is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96."
"So, there are two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time. They both travel west for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they travel north for 150 miles.

To find the total distance each train traveled, we need to add the distances they traveled on the first day and the second day. Since they traveled the same distance on the first day, we can just add the 80 miles to the 150 miles they traveled on the second day.

So, the total distance each train traveled is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach. She gets paid $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a coach. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. 
- 35 hours * $20/hour = $700 per week
- $700 per week * 50 weeks = $35,000 per year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. 
- 15 hours * $30/hour = $450 per week
- $450 per week * 50 weeks = $22,500 per year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching together. 
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first find out how much time she has left to finish the trail. 

She wants to walk 12 miles in total and has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left.

She wants to finish the remaining 6 miles in 3 hours (since she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail). 

To find the speed required, we can divide the remaining distance by the time she has left: 

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 15 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to know how old Raymond is now. We know Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so we subtract 6 from 31 to find Raymond's age.

31 - 6 = 25

Now, we know Raymond is 25 years old. We also know that his son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from 25.

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each group of customers bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total. The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total. The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find out how much shorter a candle will be after burning, we need to know how many hours it burns. We can do this by subtracting the start time from the end time.

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what number, when decreased by 25%, equals $19.50. 

Let's call the original price ""x"". We can set up an equation: x - 0.25x = 19.50. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.75x = 19.50. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.75: x = 19.50 / 0.75.

x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the shorts. Since one pair of shorts costs $16.50, we multiply 3 pairs by $16.50 to get $49.50.

Next, we do the same for the pants. One pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the shoes. One pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to figure out how many cartons she'll buy and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she'll need 60 servings in 60 days. We can divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton to find out how many cartons she'll need:

60 servings ÷ 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Each carton costs $4.00, so we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The first stop was 20 miles into the 60-mile trip. To find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, we subtract 20 from 60.

60 - 20 = 40 miles

Now, we need to find the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, we subtract 15 from 60.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we add the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

40 + 45 = 85 miles

However, this doesn't make sense because it's more likely that the second stop was before the first stop. Let's try again.

If the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, it means the second stop was 60 - 15 = 45 miles into the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract 45 from 20.

20 - 45 = -25 miles

This doesn't make sense because distance can't be negative. Let's try again.

If the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, it means the second stop was 60 - 15 = 45 miles into the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract 20 from 45.

45 - 20 = 25 miles

The final answer is: 25"
"So, Gloria is shopping for shoes and finds a pair that fits her budget. She has to choose between these boots and two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much. Together, the two pairs of heels cost $5 less than the boots.

Let's start by finding the cost of the two pairs of heels. Since one pair costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, we can find the cost of the boots by subtracting $5 from $99. So, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"So, we have two friends, Darrell and Allen, and their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years. We can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a number that makes this true.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we find that x = 9.

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages. Darrell is 7x = 7(9) = 63 years old, and Allen is 11x = 11(9) = 99 years old.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses. 

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans. The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

There are 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, we multiply 10 by 0.5.

10 * 0.5 = 5

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 5 hours by 7.

5 * 7 = 35

So, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs."
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to figure out how many silver coins she has first. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the clues given in the problem.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. Then, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of 40. Half of 40 is 20. Then, we add 5 to 20 to find out how many jewels Aaron has. 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We are told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from 25 to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = points in the first 20 minutes + points in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75"
"So, John is selling his Lego sets to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. We need to figure out how many Lego sets he has left.

First, let's find out how much money John got from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 sets for $15 each, so he got 13 * 15 = $195.

Then, he spent $20 on 8 video games, which is 8 * 20 = $160. He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he had $35 left after buying the video games, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know he had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

But we want to know how many Lego sets he has left. Since he sold all his Lego sets, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's speed, we need to know how far he runs and how long it takes him. We know he runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Dana can travel in 6 hours. We know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

First, we need to find out how fast Dana can run and walk. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is 18."
"So, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. We also know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's. To find Ben's iPhone age, we multiply Suzy's age by 2. 

Ben's iPhone age = 1 * 2 = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's age by 4.

Brandon's iPhone age = 2 * 4 = 8 years

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

There were 5 pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces initially set out is 5 x 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract 14 from 40.

40 - 14 = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

The final answer is: 26"
"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to know how many calories you have left in your daily target. You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already eaten 1800 calories.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories left.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100g, we multiply 0.8 servings by 100g per serving.

0.8 * 100 = 80g

So, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sold 20 candles. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he used 1 pound of beeswax, and he already accounted for the cost of the wick in the initial cost of the pound of wax. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = $10.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the hours for each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice bought, we need to figure out how many notes she had in total and then subtract the ones she already had in her purse.

We know she used 220 notes at work and had 23 notes left. So, the total number of notes she had is 220 + 23 = 243.

Since she already had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she bought is 243 - 80 = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"So, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. This means if he buys 5 blue ties, he buys 10 red ties. 

The blue ties cost $40 each, and he bought 5 of them, so he spent 5 x $40 = $200 on blue ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. 50% of $40 is $20, so the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

He bought 10 red ties, so he spent 10 x $60 = $600 on red ties.

In total, John spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy got, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to know how many units are in the building. We know there are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply 15 by 8 to get the total number of units.

15 * 8 = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply 120 by 3/4.

3/4 * 120 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

120 - 90 = 30 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much money Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. So, we multiply 252 eggs per day by 7 days per week.

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 1764 eggs by 12.

1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we know Lloyd sells 147 dozen eggs per week. He sells each dozen for $2. To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he is removing 30 comic books. 

First, we multiply the number of comic books by the weight of each comic book: 
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"So, there's a mechanic who charges different rates for fixing truck tires and car tires. He charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. 

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Let's calculate how much he made that day. 
- He made 6 * $60 = $360 from truck tires.
- He made 4 * $40 = $160 from car tires.
- So, in total, he made $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires, but no truck tires. 
- He made 12 * $40 = $480 from car tires.
- So, in total, he made $480 on Friday.

We need to compare the two days to see which day he made more money. $480 is less than $520, so he made more money on Thursday.

The final answer is $40."
"So, the Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens that they adopted from the local animal shelter. Their mom just told them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, had kittens too. 

We know that Patchy had 3 times as many kittens as Trixie. Since Trixie had 12 kittens, we can multiply 12 by 3 to find out how many kittens Patchy had. 12 * 3 = 36. 

Now, we need to add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has a total of 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to subtract the number of lollipops she ate from the total number of lollipops she had. 

She started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so we subtract 2 from 30:
30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2, since she wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

The cost of the ticket and popcorn is $7 + $7 = $14. 

Now, let's divide the total money available by the cost of the ticket and popcorn: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. 

The bridge can carry 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck weigh 3755 pounds. So, the weight available for the boxes is 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds.

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the available weight by the weight of a single box: 245 / 15 = 16.33.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to 16 boxes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add some extra fees to the original bill. 

First, we need to find 25% of the original bill. 25% is the same as 0.25. So, we multiply 0.25 by $40.00 to get $10.00.

Next, we add the $10.00 fee to the original bill: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster. So, we multiply 6 by 20 to get the total number of raspberries in the clusters: 6 * 20 = 120.

Then, we add the 67 individual raspberries to get the total number of raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187.

Therefore, there are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to figure out how many oranges are not good. We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour.

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 oranges is 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To find out how much Janet paid, we need to add up the costs of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

First, we add the cost of the material and the construction: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then, we need to calculate 10% of $1300 to find the insurance cost. 10% is the same as 0.1, so we multiply $1300 by 0.1 to get $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"So, Marcy works for a company for 40 years and gets a pension of $50,000 per year. But, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the pension amount every year. 

For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000 per year. That's a total of $1,000,000.

For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the pension amount. 5% of $50,000 is $2,500. So, for 10 years, she gets $2,500 per year. That's a total of $25,000.

To find the total pension after 30 years, we add the two amounts together: $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000.

The final answer is: $1,025,000"
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so she paid:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To figure out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how much gas her tank holds and how much gas she used to fill it up.

Her tank holds 12 gallons, and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. To find out how many gallons are left, we subtract the amount used from the total capacity:

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons left

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons. We already know she drove 100 miles on 4 gallons. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the miles by the gallons:

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we multiply the miles per gallon by the gallons left in the tank:

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

So, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: 200"
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours he spends each day and then multiply it by 28 days (4 weeks).

He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The answer is 44."
"To find the total number of gems, we need to figure out how many of each type there are.

Let's start with the diamonds. There are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we subtract 35 from 175 to get 140 rubies.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we multiply 140 by 2 to get 280 emeralds.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to know the total number of students. We know there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. So, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, the number of teachers is 180 / 5 = 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to figure out how much money she got from her weekly allowance. She gets $5 each week for 8 weeks. 

First, we multiply the weekly allowance by the number of weeks: $5 x 8 = $40. This is the total amount of money she got from her allowance.

Now, we need to find out how much money Bailey had at the start. We know that at the end of 8 weeks, she had $100. To find the initial amount, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she had at the end: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. Plus, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

She charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"

"So, Luke is building sandcastles at the beach. He makes 4 levels, and the top level has a square footage of 16. Each level has half the square footage of the level below it. We need to find the average square footage of each level.

To do this, we need to find the total square footage of all levels. The levels are 16, 8, 4, and 2. We add these numbers together:

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total by 4 to find the average:

30 ÷ 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"So, Cecilia has a new puppy and needs to feed it dog food. The vet says she needs to feed it 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that, she needs to feed it 2 cups of dog food every day. We need to figure out how many bags of dog food she'll use in the first year.

First, let's calculate how much food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since it eats 1 cup of food per day, we multiply 1 cup by 180 days, which is 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and it will eat 2 cups of food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so we multiply 2 cups by 365 days, which is 730 cups.

Now, we add the food eaten in the first 180 days (180 cups) to the food eaten in the rest of the year (730 cups). 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

One bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide 910 cups by 110 cups per bag. 910 ÷ 110 = 8.27. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Cecilia will need 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how much laundry David does, we need to divide Sarah's laundry by 4, since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To find out which option is cheaper, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
We need 6 packages of 3 flowers each, so the total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
We need 9 packages of 2 flowers each, so the total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is: $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost is $100. To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.3. 

$100 x 0.3 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$100 - $30 = $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

We have 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is 3 * 25 = 75.

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To find out how many games the football team won, we need to figure out how many games they lost first. Let's say the number of games lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. To find out how many games they won, we add 8 to the number of games lost:
7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The answer is 44."
"So, the alarm goes off three times a day. The first time it went off, it rang for 4 times. The second time it went off, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time.

To find out how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's salary after three more years of service, we need to add a 10% increase to her salary each year.

Year 1:
Her initial salary is $600. A 10% increase is $60, so her salary after 1 year is $600 + $60 = $660.

Year 2:
A 10% increase from $660 is $66, so her salary after 2 years is $660 + $66 = $726.

Year 3:
A 10% increase from $726 is $72.60, so her salary after 3 years is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

Year 4:
A 10% increase from $798.60 is $79.86, so her salary after 4 years is $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

Year 5:
A 10% increase from $878.46 is $87.84, so her salary after 5 years is $878.46 + $87.84 = $966.30.

Year 6:
A 10% increase from $966.30 is $96.63, so her salary after 6 years is $966.30 + $96.63 = $1062.93.

Year 7:
A 10% increase from $1062.93 is $106.29, so her salary after 7 years is $1062.93 + $106.29 = $1169.22.

Year 8:
A 10% increase from $1169.23 is $116.92, so her salary after 8 years is $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15.

Year 9:
A 10% increase from $1286.15 is $128.62, so her salary after 9 years is $1286.15 + $128.62 = $1414.77.

Year 10:
A 10% increase from $1414.77 is $141.48, so her salary after 10 years is $1414.77 + $141.48 = $1556.25.

The final answer is $1556.25."
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide the total number of copies sold (88,000) by 11, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

Let's do the math:

88,000 ÷ 11 = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To figure out how many guests will show up, we need to calculate 3/4 of the number of friends Christina invited. Since 1/4 don't show up, that means 3/4 of the friends will be there.

3/4 of 16 is 12. So, 12 friends will show up.

Now, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags, we multiply 12 by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost will be 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the amount for adults and children separately.

First, let's calculate the amount for adults. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad. So, the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the amount for children. There are 5 children, and each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. So, the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To find out how many pets the three have, we need to figure out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To find out how old Jackson is, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first.

We know James is 10 years old, and he's 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles now, we need to know how fast he used to run. Let's call that speed 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed is x + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

We can set up an equation to find Gerald's original speed: x + 2 = 38. To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 38 - 2
x = 36

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we need to find his new speed after his diet change. His speed improved by 10%. To find 10% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.1:

0.1 * 36 = 3.6

We add this to his original speed to find his new speed:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to figure out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept.

2/3 of 9 hours = (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours

Since Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, we can find the difference by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to figure out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce.

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces.

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 ÷ 3 = 5.33

Since we can't use a fraction of a tomato, we round down to 5 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 5 cans of tomatoes.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to figure out how many cars were in the traffic jam in total and then subtract the number of cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Then, 5 cars took an exit, so we subtract those from the total: 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the last 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the 20 cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes from the 25 cars that were left after 5 cars took an exit. So, 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"So, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her house. To find out how many potted plants she already has, we need to multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants on each ledge.

40 window ledges * 2 potted plants per ledge = 80 potted plants

Then, Mary got 18 new potted plants. So, the total number of potted plants she has now is:
80 + 18 = 98

She wants to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. There are 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants. To find out how many she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she's giving away from the total number of plants she has:
98 - 40 = 58

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is 58."
"So, Jerome had 4 friends visiting him. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend rang the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend rang the doorbell 20 times, the second friend rang the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks.

He has to read 4 pages from Science, 20 pages from Social Studies, 7 pages from History, and 8 pages from Geography. Let's add them up:

4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we need to subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we need to find out how many pages he needs to read per day to finish in 4 days. We can do this by dividing the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"So, John likes to drink water with his meals and before bed. He does this every day, but on weekends, he drinks soda with dinner instead of water. 

Let's break it down: John drinks water with his meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and before bed, which is 4 times a day. That's 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he drinks 4 * 7 = 28 glasses of water in a week. 

However, on weekends, he drinks soda with dinner instead of water, so we need to subtract 2 glasses of water (1 glass for Saturday and 1 glass for Sunday). 

28 - 2 = 26 

The final answer is: 26"
"To figure out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance the fog bank covers in that time.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since it takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover 3 miles, we need to multiply 14 by 10 to get the total time.

14 sets of 10 minutes is 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many jigsaw pieces are left, we need to follow the steps:

First, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy placed on the board. Since she placed a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we can calculate it by multiplying 1000 by 1/4. This gives us 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed her pieces. We do this by subtracting 250 from 1000, which gives us 750 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces her mom placed on the board. Her mom placed a third of the remaining 750 pieces. To find this out, we multiply 750 by 1/3. This gives us 250 pieces.

Finally, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed her pieces. We do this by subtracting 250 from 750, which gives us 500 pieces.

So, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed."
"So, we know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. To do this, we multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

3 x 5 = 15

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody. 

5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20

So, together they eat 20 cookies."
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year. Let's say he baked x cookies last year.

This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. This can be simplified to 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 110 - 10
2x = 100

Next, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"So, there's this gas station that sells gas for $3.00 per gallon. There's also an app that gives you $0.20 back for every gallon you buy. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will they pay in total?

To find the answer, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas first. We do this by multiplying the price per gallon ($3.00) by the number of gallons (10). 

$3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Next, we need to calculate the cashback amount. We do this by multiplying the price per gallon ($0.20) by the number of gallons (10). 

$0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost. 

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups they had and then divide it by 2.

Beatrice had roll-ups that were 2 wide and 24 long, so we multiply 2 x 24 to get 48 roll-ups. Marcell had roll-ups that were 3 wide and 14 long, so we multiply 3 x 14 to get 42 roll-ups. 

Now, we add 48 and 42 to get the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 ÷ 2 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can divide the total time it took her to reach the shore (64 seconds) by 16 seconds to find the total number of 20-foot intervals: 

64 / 16 = 4

Since she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, she rowed 4 x 20 feet in 4 x 16 seconds = 64 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on for each 20-foot interval. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 x 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 20 feet.

Since Julia rowed 64 feet, the boat took on 64 / 20 = 3.2 times 2 liters of water.

3.2 x 2 = 6.4 liters

The final answer is: 6.4"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons per day and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. 

So, we multiply 4 (number of teachers) by 2 (number of lessons per day) and then by 3 (number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson).

4 x 2 = 8
8 x 3 = 24

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To find out how many flowers Ryan has, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants per day (2) by the number of days (15). 

First, we multiply 2 and 15: 2 * 15 = 30. 

Then, we subtract the number of flowers that didn't grow (5) from 30: 30 - 5 = 25.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to figure out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we divide 1800 by 6.

1800 ÷ 6 = 300

Now, we know that the number of photographs on Brittany's phone is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. To find the number of ducks, we divide 300 by 50.

300 ÷ 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. She bought 10 of them for $10 each. So, the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

Next, let's find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. She bought 5 of them for $16 each. So, the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: $100 + $80 = $180.

The prices have gone up by 50%, so the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 ÷ 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we can round down to 17 teaspoons per part.

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
17 * 7 = 119

So, Katy used 119 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 119"
"To find out how much John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair and then multiply by the number of children.

Let's break it down:

Number of pairs of shoes per child: 2
Cost per pair: $60
Number of children: 3

First, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes per child by the number of children: 2 * 3 = 6
Then, we multiply the result by the cost per pair: 6 * $60 = $360

So, John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to subtract the initial number of containers from the total number of containers.

Let's do the math:

Initial number of containers = 2
Total number of containers = 30

Number of containers imported on the second day = Total number of containers - Initial number of containers
= 30 - 2
= 28

So, 28 containers were imported on the second day."
"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. So, we multiply 2 by 4:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply 8 pads by 30 sheets:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"So, Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together. Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is 27."

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, we need to find out how far she runs in the first 3 hours. Since she runs 10 miles per hour, we multiply 10 miles/hour by 3 hours:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how far she runs in the remaining 4 hours. Since she runs 5 miles per hour, we multiply 5 miles/hour by 4 hours:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is 50."
"So, Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of those letters. To find out how many letters she put stamps on, we can divide 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she put stamps on from the current total.

30 (already-stamped letters) - 20 (letters put stamps on) = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many spoons Julia had before she used some to sample her stew. We know that she had 12 spoons in the end, and her husband gave her 5 spoons. 

Let's say the number of spoons Julia bought is x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

This equation means that the number of spoons Julia bought (x), plus the 5 spoons her husband gave her, minus the 3 spoons she used, equals 12.

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Now, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10

So, Julia bought 10 spoons.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

He bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can find the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to 38. 

38 + 6 = 44

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages.

38 + 44 = 82

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in total."
"So, we know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Since Lily made 50 friends, we can find out how many friends Amy made by adding 20 to 50. 

50 + 20 = 70

Now, we need to add the number of friends Amy and Lily have together. We can do this by adding 50 (Lily's friends) and 70 (Amy's friends).

50 + 70 = 120

So, Amy and Lily have 120 friends together."
"So, there are three types of fruits: watermelons, peppers, and oranges. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper. We know that a pepper costs 15 dollars. 

To find the cost of a watermelon, we multiply the cost of a pepper by 3. So, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45 dollars.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. So, an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 * 45 = 180 dollars
- 20 peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300 dollars
- 10 oranges cost 10 * 40 = 400 dollars

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 dollars."
"To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total money made from patients and doctors.

First, we find out how many hours the doctors and patients spend at the hospital. There are 500 people and each person is seen for 24 minutes. We need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 24 minutes by 60 to get 0.4 hours. 

Now, we multiply 500 people by 0.4 hours to get the total time spent on patients: 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so we multiply 200 hours by $150 to get the total money made from doctors: 200 * 150 = $30,000.

The patients pay $200 per hour, so we multiply 200 hours by $200 to get the total money made from patients: 200 * 200 = $40,000.

The total money made is $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000.

The hospital spends $30,000 on doctors. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total money made: $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $40,000."
"To find out how many elves are left, we need to subtract the elves that quit from the total number of elves.

First, we need to find out how many elves quit after kids vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can divide 60 by 3. 

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit. Now, we subtract 20 from the total number of elves: 60 - 20 = 40.

Next, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the amount spent in May and June. 

The amount spent in May is $500. In June, he spent $60 less. So, the amount spent in June is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to figure out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we multiply 4 by 6 to get 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the number of months in a year.

There are 12 months in a year. If Tom gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply 4 by 12.

4 * 12 = 48

Now, we need to multiply 48 by the cost of each car wash, which is $15.

48 * 15 = 720

So, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

The final answer is: $720"
"So, we know that Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5 right before the comparison was made. To find out how many video games Brian has now, we need to subtract 5 from 20.

20 - 5 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. We know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we can multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 * 15 = 45
45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to do a few simple math steps.

First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can divide the total number of unicorns by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total cost of Rory's order, we need to add up the cost of each item.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

There's also a delivery fee of 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"So, Mark took two tests. The first test had 75 questions and he finished it in 8 hours. He can answer 5 questions per hour. To find out how many questions he answered, we multiply 5 questions per hour by 8 hours. That's 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

The second test had 100 questions and he finished it in 6 hours. He can answer 5 questions per hour. To find out how many questions he answered, we multiply 5 questions per hour by 6 hours. That's 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

Now, we add the questions he answered in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions. Since the first test had 75 questions, we subtract 70 from 75 to find out how many questions he left incomplete. That's 75 - 70 = 5 questions.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Let's do the math:
Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final answer is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

There are 20 cars in total. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is (4 / 20) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%.

The final answer is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to figure out how many bees are in the hive. We know there are 700 bees in total. 

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's start by finding the number of queens. If we call the number of queens ""Q"", then the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write an equation: 700 = 4Q + 2Q + Q. 

Combine like terms: 700 = 7Q.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is 400."
"So, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. We need to figure out how much money he would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working.

Let's break it down. If he plays video games for 2 hours a day, that's 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week. Since he earns $10 an hour, we multiply 14 hours by $10 to find out how much he would earn in a week.

14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the food items and the non-food items separately.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars, respectively. So, the total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars, respectively. So, the total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

There's a 10% tax on the non-food items. To find the tax amount, we multiply the total cost of the non-food items by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%). So, 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items (including tax): 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The total cost of everything is 16 dollars.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract it from his total income.

Kim has 8 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

First, let's find the total cost of bleach: 8 clients * 2 bottles = 16 bottles. 16 bottles * $2 = $32.

Next, let's find the total cost of cloths: 8 clients * 1 pack = 8 packs. 8 packs * $5 = $40.

Now, we add the cost of bleach and cloths: $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to know how many pineapples he has in total and how often he harvests them.

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples he has is:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he can harvest his pineapples 4 times a year. To find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by 4:
1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To figure out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees come back, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

So, the total number of bees that left in the first three periods is 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees.

Since 15 bees had already come back, the number of bees that left in the first three periods and hadn't come back yet is 105 - 15 = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the first three periods come back, which is 90 bees.

The final answer is 90."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"So, we know Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. We also know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To figure out who wins the race, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles away from school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. We need to convert 3 miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 3 miles is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.

Now, we can calculate how long it takes Steve to get home: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, and he can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. We need to convert 2 miles to feet: 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate how long it takes Tim to get home: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find out how long Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. We do this by subtracting the time it takes Steve to get home from the time it takes Tim to get home: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then add them together.

For bicycles, she inflated 5 people's 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.
For tricycles, she inflated 3 people's 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.
For the unicycle, she inflated 1 person's 1 tire, so that's 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl gets, we need to do a few simple math problems. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl bought. We know he bought 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, we multiply 10 packs by 6 cookies to get the total number of cookies: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out how much the cookies cost. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Now, Carl paid with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill: 
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To figure out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that ants took 1 french fry and left 5 behind. So, before the ants took their french fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.

Then, a raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'x'. We can set up an equation: 1/3 of 'x' is 6. To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 3, which gives us x = 6 * 3 = 18.

So, before the raccoon ate, there were 18 fries.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Then, a seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. We know Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

Finally, Dave initially ate 14 fries. So, the pack had 34 - 14 = 20 fries when Dave bought it.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Kimo has classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He has 3 classes of 1 hour each on these days. That's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

He also has classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He has 2 classes of 2 hours each on these days. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

There are 16 weeks in a semester. So, Kimo spends 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to add the hours he spends on both types of days. 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls. There are 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 24 inches long (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, and 2 feet is equal to 24 inches). So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 24 = 1440 inches.

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in feet = (1200 + 720 + 1440) / 12
Total length in feet = 3360 / 12
Total length in feet = 280 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To figure out who wins the contest, we need to calculate how far each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he's running back and forth, he's covering the whole 100 yards twice with each run. So, he runs 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, she runs 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to add up the costs of all the things he bought.

He bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, 4 pens will cost 4 x $1.5 = $6.

He also bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, 2 notebooks will cost 2 x $4 = $8.

Lastly, he bought a roll of bond paper for $20.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles he initially saw.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles he initially saw.

So, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid (2) from the initial number of tadpoles (11). 

11 - 2 = 9

Therefore, Finn can see 9 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we need to find two thirds of the water depth on Tuesday. Two thirds of 24 feet is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

The initial price is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We can see that the price is increasing by $4 every 2 months. So, we can multiply the initial price by 18 (which is 36/2) and add the initial price to get the final price.

$20 * 18 = $360
$20 + $360 = $380

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Let's recalculate:

$20 + $4 = $24
$24 + $4.80 = $28.80
$28.80 + $9.60 = $38.40
$38.40 + $7.68 = $46.08
$46.08 + $9.36 = $55.44
$55.44 + $11.08 = $66.52
$66.52 + $13.20 = $79.72
$79.72 + $16.28 = $96.00
$96.00 + $19.60 = $115.60
$115.60 + $23.20 = $138.80
$138.80 + $27.60 = $166.40
$166.40 + $31.20 = $197.60
$197.60 + $35.80 = $233.40
$233.40 + $40.00 = $273.40
$273.40 + $44.00 = $317.40
$317.40 + $48.00 = $365.40
$365.40 + $51.60 = $417.00
$417.00 + $55.20 = $472.20
$472.20 + $58.40 = $530.60

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $530.60.

The correct answer is $530.60."
"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to know the cost of each type of toy.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

We also know that one red car costs $4.

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"So, Jackie is thinking about whether to do her taxes by herself or hire an accountant. If she does it by herself, she'll lose 3 hours of work, and she makes $35 per hour. That means she'll lose 3 * $35 = $105.

The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost from the amount she'll lose. So, $105 - $90 = $15.

The answer is $15."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the cost of all the computer accessories.

The computer costs €1090, the scanner costs €157, the CD burner costs €74, and the printer costs €102. Let's add them up:

€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is 77."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 15 eggs. Since she gets 3 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide 15 by 3 to find out how many times she needs to babysit.

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times."
"Let's solve the problem.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Seth's age be x, then Brooke's age is x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years is 28. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4 + x + 4 = 56

Now, let's combine like terms:

3x + 8 = 56

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days. So, he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

First, let's calculate the legs of the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of spider legs is 80 x 8 = 640.

Next, let's calculate the legs of the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of insect legs is 90 x 6 = 540.

Lastly, let's calculate the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates, and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 x 10 = 30.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to figure out their ages. 

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"So, Jessica has some debts that she needs to pay off. She has student loans, credit cards, and a mortgage. The minimum payments for these are $300, $200, and $500, respectively. 

To find out how much she pays each month, we need to add these amounts together. 

$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we multiply it by 0.5. 

0.5 x $1000 = $500

We add this to the total minimum payment: 

$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is how much Jessica pays each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12.

$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato, and 5 seconds to cut it up. We need to add these times together to get the total time to prepare one potato. 

1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

We can convert this to seconds for easier understanding:
94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to figure out how much money they made from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the money they make from selling one gallon of lemonade is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

They made a total of $25 in profit. Profit is the money they made minus the cost. So, we can set up an equation:

$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:

$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:

$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

So, Juan and his brother Carlos spent $35 on lemons.

$35"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to know how many Chinese people there are in total. We know that there are 240 people in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that 60 of the Chinese people are boys. To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese people - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much money Zaid has left, we need to calculate how much he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The amount left after these expenses is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

So, Zaid will have 350$ left after all his expenses and donations."
"So, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which means Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we need to add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to multiply the number of hours he worked by the amount he earns per hour. 

For the first week, Lloyd worked 5 hours and earns $10 per hour, so he earned 5 x $10 = $50.

For the second week, Lloyd worked 8 hours and earns $10 per hour, so he earned 8 x $10 = $80.

To find the total amount he earned, we add the two amounts together: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we need to know how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's say the number of white carnations is 'x'. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To find Jean's age, we need to figure out Mark's age first. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Jan is 30 years old, so half of that is 30 / 2 = 15. Two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that Mark is 2 years older than Jean. So, to find Jean's age, we need to add 2 to Mark's age. Mark is 20 + 2 = 22 years old. Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in total time between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"So, Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We want to know how much more likely it is for him to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we count the number of good outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 good outcomes and 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we count the number of good outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

There are 3 good outcomes and 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 3/36, which simplifies to 1/12.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

The difference in probability is 0.5 - 0.0833, which is 0.4167. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 41.67%.

So, Jerry is approximately 41.67% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 41.67%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many apples Jenna picked. 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom. 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to figure out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and rabbits first.

There are 10 hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

In total, the hamsters and rabbits used 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw.

Since the total number of straw used is 160, the number of straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for rats is 3 x 6 = 18.

Since 90 pieces of straw are used for rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces, the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest first. The interest is 2% of the $100 she owes. 

2% of $100 is $2. Since she paid after 3 months, we multiply the $2 by 3 to get the total interest. 

$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount she owed. 

$100 + $6 = $106

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final answer is: $106"
"To find out how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue.

The trader bought the wheat at $20 per bag, and it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost is the cost of the wheat plus the cost of transportation. Let's call the number of bags the trader bought ""x"".

The total cost is 20x + 2x, which is 22x.

The trader sold the wheat at $30 per bag, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8x = 400

To find the number of bags, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. 

First, let's find the cost of the food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, and each ride costs $33. So, the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. Cost per person = $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per hour.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is 360."
"To figure out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

The ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week. There are 7 days in a week. 

To find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide 3.5 by 7.

3.5 ÷ 7 = 0.5

So, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"So, Tom plants 10 trees every year. He starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees in 10 years, so he has 10 * 10 = 100 trees. Then, he chops down 2 trees every year, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. That means he has 100 - 20 = 80 trees left.

But then, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0.3. 80 * 0.3 = 24. So, 24 trees die.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has left: 80 - 24 = 56 trees.

The final answer is 56."
"So, there were 18 pink flamingos initially. The neighbors took back one third of them, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. Now, there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to divide the total amount of carrots available by the number of restaurants. 

There are 200 pounds of carrots and 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots. 

200 ÷ 40 = 5

This means each restaurant gets 5 pounds of carrots. But we already know that each restaurant gets 2 pounds. So, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots are left over.

200 - (40 * 2) = 200 - 80 = 120

There are 120 pounds of carrots left over."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

We know that the total population is 23786, and the number of men and women is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. 

So, the number of children is 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

The answer is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 cards."
"So, Mark is a copy-editor who edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total of 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. To find out how much Mark makes from Publisher A, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we multiply the amount Mark makes from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he makes from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how much water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can multiply the number of pails by 5 to find the total amount of water in liters.

Morning: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Now, let's add the morning and afternoon amounts together: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"So, John won an award at work. The award is worth $5,000 and it's a one-time thing. He makes $2,000 a week, and he gets paid every week of the year. If he got the award on the first day of the year, how much money did he make that year?

To figure this out, we need to calculate how much he made before the award and then add the award amount. 

He makes $2,000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:
$2,000 * 52 = $104,000

Then, we add the award amount:
$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

So, John made $109,000 that year.

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to do a little math.

First, we know that each acre of the farm produces 5 tons of grapes. Since there are 10 acres, we multiply 10 by 5 to get the total tons of grapes.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total tons of grapes by 2 to get the total barrels of wine.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"So, Carl likes cheese a lot. He eats a sandwich for lunch every day, and he uses 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he uses 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl eats cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He uses one more slice of cheese per omelet than he does per sandwich. Since he uses 2 slices per sandwich, he uses 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he uses 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese, and he uses 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we need to add up all the slices: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add up the number of pens in each color.

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens had 9 pens, and each bag of red pens had 6 pens.

Let's start by adding the green and yellow pens: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we need to add the blue pens. There were 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens, so we multiply 6 x 9 = 54. Now we add 54 to 32: 32 + 54 = 86.

Finally, we need to add the red pens. There were 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens, so we multiply 2 x 6 = 12. Now we add 12 to 86: 86 + 12 = 98.

Janet now has 98 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to know the total score she wants for all six tests. Since she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6. 

93 * 6 = 558

Now, we need to add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358

To find the score she needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score she wants: 
558 - 358 = 200

So, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 200."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total, we need to add up the number of cakes she bought each day.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To find the cost of each cup, we need to know the total cost of 20 dozen cups and the number of cups.

First, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 3 plates, and each plate costs $6000. So, the total cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than $18000. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. So, the cost per cup is $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 x 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we can divide $60 by $5:
$60 / $5 = 12

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60. To do this, we can divide $60 by $4:
$60 / $4 = 15

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 15"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. If we let 'r' be the number of red chickens, then the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. We can write an equation to represent this:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle, so we add up the lengths of all four sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, we plug those numbers into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed, which is 3 miles per hour. 

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two pools, and both are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative.

Let's try a different approach. We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. We can set up an equation based on this: 4y = 2x - 16 + 16. Simplifying, we get 4y = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 2y = x.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can substitute 2y for x in the second equation: 2y - 16 = y. Adding 16 to both sides, we get 2y = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 8.

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy from her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00. 

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage of $8.00. 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"So, Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an extra 10% of the amount. This means she has to pay back $2000 + 10% of $2000.

To find 10% of $2000, I'll multiply $2000 by 0.1. That's $2000 x 0.1 = $200. So, she needs to pay back $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, she's going to pay $165 every month for 12 months. To find out how much she'll pay in total, I'll multiply $165 by 12. That's $165 x 12 = $1980.

Since she needs to pay $2200 and she's paying $1980, I'll subtract $1980 from $2200 to find the remaining balance. $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

The final answer is 15."
"So, we have three people: Harriet, Adrian, and Zack. Harriet is 21 years old now. We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. That's 21 * 2 = 42 years old for Zack.

Now, we know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3. That's 21 * 3 = 63 years old for Adrian.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add up their ages and divide by 3. So, 24 + 45 + 66 = 135. Then, we divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to figure out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles. Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles, and it takes her 10 minutes to finish one. So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles. Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles, and it takes her 5 minutes to finish one. So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time spent. 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

He plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, let's add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. Since the company spends a third of the first year's amount, we divide $15,000 by 3.

$15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to calculate the cost of each of their rentals and add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for $30 an hour. He used it for 3 hours, so we multiply 3 hours by $30 to get the total cost. 3 * 30 = $90.

Benji rented a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. He used it for 5 hours, so we multiply 5 hours by $18 to get the total cost. 5 * 18 = $90.

Now, we add the cost of Carlos' rental and Benji's rental together. $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. 
The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The answer is 9."
"So, James has a bunch of Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards. But then, he loses 8 of the water-type cards. That means he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.

He also buys 14 new grass-type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards. Let's add up all the cards: 30 fire-type + 34 grass-type + 32 water-type = 96 cards in total.

To find the chance of picking a water-type card, we need to divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards. That's 32 water-type cards divided by 96 total cards. 

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water-type card is 33%.

The final answer is 33%."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to add up the cost of all the things he got.

First, we start with the base burrito, which costs $6.50. Then, he adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. That's $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50, then $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50, and $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. He also gets 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's $0.50. Now we add that to $10.50, which is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. Then, he upgrades his meal for $3.00, so now it's $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. Finally, he uses a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from $14.00, which is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces they can put together per minute. 

Kalinda can put 4 pieces together per minute. Her mom can put half as many pieces together per minute, so her mom can put 4 / 2 = 2 pieces together per minute.

Together, they can put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces together per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"So, there's a watermelon farm with 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and picked 36 watermelons because 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

When she came back two weeks later, she picked 63 more watermelons because 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. 

To find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest, we need to subtract the total number of watermelons picked from the total number of watermelons.

Total watermelons picked = 36 + 63 = 99

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 120 - 99 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's find the cost of the cars. There are 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to find the tax. The tax is 10% of the cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10. This gives us $24,000.

Now, let's add the registration fees. There are 12 cars, and each car costs $1,000 for registration. So, the total registration fees are 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees together. $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

50 (ants) + 25 (bugs) = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to figure out how many penguins left the group. 

We know that one-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean and another one-third went inside the cave. Since one-third is the same as 1/3, we can divide 36 by 3 to find out how many penguins left. 

36 ÷ 3 = 12

So, 12 penguins left the group. To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we subtract 12 from the total number of penguins. 

36 - 12 = 24

But wait, we need to remember that 12 penguins also left the group. So, we need to subtract 12 from 24. 

24 - 12 = 12

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"So, Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as many as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day. To find out how many tomatoes he eats in a week, we multiply 6 by 7.

6 * 7 = 42

Since Steve eats twice as many as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount. So, we divide 42 by 2.

42 / 2 = 21

Now, we need to figure out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine makes 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide 42 by 3.

So, Steve needs 14 vines to grow enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

The final answer is 14."
"To figure out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices he wants by the number of slices per pizza. 

There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices, so we multiply 20 by 4 to get the total number of slices needed: 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we need to divide 80 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find out how many pens Ram can make, we need to divide the number of pens he has by 5, since he can make one full pen from 5 empty pens.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow some steps.

First, we need to find out how many students went out through exit A. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left after 300 students went out through exit A. We subtract 300 from 1000, which is 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students went out through exit B. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. We subtract 420 from 700, which is 700 - 420 = 280 students.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2.

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. To find out how many candies James has, we can add 6 to Robert's candies.

27 + 6 = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we can subtract James' candies from John's candies.

54 - 33 = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"So, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books too, that means they'll read 2 books from Dolly's and 1 book from Pandora's, and also 1 book from Pandora's and 2 books from Dolly's.

Let's add the books they'll read: 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) + 1 (Pandora's book) + 2 (Dolly's books) = 6 books.

So, in total, they'll read 6 books."
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Mike has 3 penpals left, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, Mike gets 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since Mike responds to all the letters, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing 60 pages. To do this, we multiply 60 pages by 6 minutes per page: 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 360 minutes by 60 to find out how many hours Mike spends writing: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin had 24 french fries initially. Then, Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After that, Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. So, after Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 9 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 9.

x = 18

So, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two aquariums with different numbers of snails. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

The problem says that the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. This means that the number of fish in both aquariums is half of the difference between the number of snails. To find the number of fish, we need to divide the difference between the number of snails by 2.

So, we divide 28 by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Since there are 14 fish in each aquarium, and both aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is 14.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how much the makeup artist paid, we need to calculate the total hours she worked and then subtract a 10% discount.

She works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, so she works 6 * 4 = 24 hours a week. Since the movie took 5 weeks, she worked a total of 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost before the discount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

A 10% discount means she gets 10% of $30,000 back. 10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

So, the total amount she paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up the cost of all the party supplies.

The total cost is $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96.

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to do a few simple math problems. 

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag. There are 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, 4 * 50 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much 200 pounds of onions cost. We know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply 200 by $1.50. 

200 * $1.50 = $300

So, the chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to know how many cookies her sister ate on Monday and Tuesday. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we multiply 5 by 4 to get 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we multiply 13 by 2 to get 26 cookies. 

Now, we add the cookies Sue ate on both days: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. 

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the number of cookies each person ate by 200 to find the calories consumed. Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. 

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories her sister ate from the calories Sue ate: 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to figure out the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, that means 50% are boys. There are 3 classes, so we multiply 50% by 3 classes to get the total number of girls. 

50% of 3 classes is 1.5 classes. Since each class has 20 students, we multiply 1.5 classes by 20 students per class to get the total number of girls. 

1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract 15 + 12 from 30. 

30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, that means the number of boys is also 50% of the total number of students. The total number of students is 3 classes * 20 students per class, which is 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

We know the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract 27 from 30.

30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now, we need to do some simple math.

First, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted (9) from the initial number of apps (61). This will give us the number of apps he had left.

61 - 9 = 52

Then, we need to add the number of new apps he downloaded (18) to the number of apps he had left.

52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"To figure out how many animals Rick killed, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at what Rick killed last night. He killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Then, today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

Also, today he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
- Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to multiply his starting floor (3) by 4 and add 6.

3 * 4 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to figure out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

We know that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.3. This gives us 9. So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down, we multiply 21 by 4. This gives us 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and puts them evenly into the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall now, we add the 40 new cows to the 20 cows and divide by 20.

20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) = 60 cows
60 cows / 20 stalls = 3 cows per stall

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

3 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 24 cows

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of money and add it together.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins. There are 100 pennies, which is 100 x $0.01 = $1. There are 40 nickels, which is 40 x $0.05 = $2. There are 20 dimes, which is 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Now, let's add the values of the coins together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5. Then, we add the value of the dollar bills, which is 40 x $1 = $40.

So, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is $5 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."
"To find out how much Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's find out how much she owes for the overdue books. There are 8 books, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the overdue books.

8 x $0.50 = $4.00

Next, we need to add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue. The flat fee is $2.00. So, we add $4.00 and $2.00 to get the total amount she owes.

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. We also know that Andrea has 52 apples. To find out how many apples Jamal has, we can subtract 8 from 52.

52 - 8 = 44

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Now, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. To find out how many bananas Jamal has, we can add 4 to 44.

44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find out how many bananas Andrea has, we can divide 48 by 2.

48 ÷ 2 = 24

Now, let's add up the number of fruits that Andrea and Jamal have. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, while Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Andrea: 52 + 24 = 76
Jamal: 44 + 48 = 92

The total number of fruits is: 76 + 92 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies).

She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Let's add those together:

36 + 30 = 66

Now, we need to divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour she needs:

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5

So, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to find two thirds of the pennies in the cup. 

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we need to do a simple math problem. 

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box. There are 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, 5 * 50 = 250.

Then, Maddison gets 20 more marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add 20 to 250. 250 + 20 = 270.

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to know how many trees each of them has.

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half of that, so he has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: 11 - 3 = 8.

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much money the girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Adding this to the selling price, we get $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find out how much money Mr. Tan got from selling his house, we need to subtract the costs from the selling price.

First, we need to find out how much he paid for the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. 3% of $400,000 is $12,000. Then, he paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. 5% of $400,000 is $20,000. So, the total amount he paid is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount he paid from the selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up the oil, and then it takes 40% longer than that. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat up the oil. So, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, we add the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken. The total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we need to multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50). This gives us $5 * 50 = $250.

Next, we multiply the cost per television ad ($75) by the number of ads (15). This gives us $75 * 15 = $1125.

Finally, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads. $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we divide 16 by 2 to find the number of golf balls: 16 ÷ 2 = 8.

Now that we know there are 8 golf balls, we need to find out how many of them are blue. Half of the golf balls are blue, so we divide 8 by 2 again: 8 ÷ 2 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

There are 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows.

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, not connected to the bedrooms. So, the total number of additional windows is 2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we need to add up the prices of the things the mom bought.

The mom bought cocoa for $4.20, laundry for $9.45, and pasta for $1.35. Let's add these numbers together:

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the things the mom bought is $15.00. 

Since the mom paid $20, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

$20 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives the mom $5.00 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to figure out how many stitches are left after we subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

We know the whole sweater is 1800 stitches. To find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet. This is equal to 20 * 40 = 800 dollars.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet. This is equal to 80 * 30 = 2400 dollars.

The total cost of the seeds is 800 + 2400 = 3200 dollars.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break it down into parts.

The song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. But Sean only needs to remember a third of those lines, which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so he needs to remember 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we need to follow some steps.

First, we need to find out how many cards had the letter A on them. We know that 2/5 of the cards had the letter A. Since there were 80 cards in total, we can calculate this by multiplying 2/5 by 80.

2/5 * 80 = 32

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. Now, we need to find out how many cards were left. We subtract the cards with the letter A from the total number of cards.

80 - 32 = 48

Now, we need to find out how many cards had the letter B on them. We know that 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. We can calculate this by multiplying 1/2 by 48.

1/2 * 48 = 24

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. Now, we need to find out how many cards were left. We subtract the cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.

48 - 24 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many cards had the letter C on them. We know that 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C. We can calculate this by multiplying 5/8 by 24.

5/8 * 24 = 15

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. Now, we need to find out how many cards had the letter D on them. We subtract the cards with the letter C from the remaining cards.

24 - 15 = 9

Therefore, 9 cards had the letter D on them.

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes. Matthew digs 30 small holes, and it takes him 3 minutes to dig each one. So, the total time for small holes is 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for large holes. Matthew digs 15 large holes, and it takes him 10 minutes to dig each one. So, the total time for large holes is 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Mico and Marco want to know each other's ages in 10 years. We know that their current ages add up to 20. Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is C. We can write an equation: M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10). We can simplify this to M + C + 20.

We know that M + C = 20, so we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, in 10 years, Mico and Marco's ages will add up to 40."
"Let's solve the problem.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If we let Ruby's age be R and Sam's age be S, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

We can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is 6."

"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To figure out how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy pizzas for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of people is:

12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 12 * 2 (guests) = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs:

39 ÷ 3 = 13

Since Maddy can't buy a fraction of a pizza, she needs to buy 13 pizzas.

Now, we need to find out how much 13 pizzas will cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to figure out how much space is left between the topaz gemstones. 

There are 8 topaz gemstones, and each one is 1 inch long. So, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the space left between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the space left by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"So, Alani's family decided that the kids should write stories of any kind. They had to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, how many stories did they write altogether?

To find the total number of stories, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories. Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories. Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To find the brother's age in 3 years, we need to know his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

So, the brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age. 
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we multiply 5 by 25 to get 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and dimes together: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To figure out how many trucks are needed, we need to know how much one truck can carry and how many flagstones we need to move.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. We want to move 80 flagstones. So, we multiply 80 by 75 to find the total weight.

80 * 75 = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to know how many trucks can carry 6000 pounds. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide 6000 by 2000.

6000 ÷ 2000 = 3

So, we need 3 trucks to move 80 flagstones.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to know the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane.

The car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. If we let the total number of medals given out be 'x', we can set up the equation: 10x = 39.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10 = 3.9.

Since the number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can round down to 3, but in this case, we can also consider the exact number of medals given out.

The final answer is: 3.9"
"So, we have 4 adults and 8 kids who are sharing 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet has 5 chocolate bars. 

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars we have in total. We have 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars, so we multiply 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

Now, the 4 adults are going to get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is 4 * 6 = 24.

We subtract the chocolate bars the adults are getting from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 kids. To find out how many each kid will get, we divide 16 by 8, which is 2.

So, each kid will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"So, there are three friends - Mike, Jim, and Tony. They played a game for 3 rounds. 

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have more than 20 points. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will get an extra point each.

Mike's points will be 21 + 1 = 22.
Jim's points will be 18 + 1 = 19.
Tony's points will be 42 + 1 = 43.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 22 + 19 + 43 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to figure out how many oranges the sons washed. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he's 4 years old. Since the youngest son is half as old, he also washed half of 8 oranges, which is 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"So, Darren is doing some exercises for a week. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He does 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the total number of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

So, the total number of exercises Darren did in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To figure out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to think about how much rice is eaten each week.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for two meals a day. So, for one person, it's 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg per day. Since there are 5 people, the total amount of rice eaten per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice eaten per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount eaten per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Sam sells bread and he wants to sell 120 crates in a week. But he's closed on Monday and Friday, and he sold some crates over the weekend. Let's break it down:

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. Then, on Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. To find out how many crates he sold in total, we need to add these numbers together.

15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
45 + 20 = 65 crates

Now, we need to compare this to his target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he's short, we subtract 65 from 120.

120 - 65 = 55

So, Sam is 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much the desk costs, we need to add up the bids. 

The bids on the desk are $200, $250, $300, and $350. Carmen bids after each of the other people, so her bids are $200, $250, and $300. 

We need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid, which is $350. 

$350 + $300 = $650

We also need to add the cost of the bids made by the other 3 people. 

$50 + $50 + $50 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen's last bid. 

$650 + $150 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"So, John has to drive to work and back home every day. His work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, which makes it 60 miles per day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. Since he works 50 weeks a year, he drives a total of 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

He gets charged $2 for every mile he drives, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000. He also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

To find the total cost per year, we add the cost of driving and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a simple folding newspaper or tabloid, you need to fold a piece of paper in half and then print the pages on each side. 

Imagine you have a 32-page tabloid. If you print the pages on each side, you'll need to consider the front and back of each side. 

For the left side, you'll need 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back. That's a total of 8 + 8 = 16 pages. 

The same goes for the right side - you'll need 8 pages on the front and 8 pages on the back, which is another 16 pages. 

So, in total, you'll need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

The final answer is 32."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she brought.

Annika brought $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elise made in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold that year.

We know she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and there were 250 books in total. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells for 20 dollars, the total amount of money she made in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"So, Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours in a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, he works 50 * 4 = 200 hours in April.

He earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings for the week are 200 * $10 = $2000. Plus, he gets a $300 bonus for the month because the company did well. So, his total earnings for April are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 x 0.8. 

20 x 0.8 = 16

So, John lost to 16 people."
"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of those loaves. Two-thirds of 60 is 40 loaves. So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left. We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves made: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

The remaining 20 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we divide 20 by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses per week, we can divide 8 by 4.

8 ÷ 4 = 2

So, Joey loses 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks by the weight lost per week to find the total weight lost.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

It will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how much you'll save, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
So, the total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

Now, let's calculate the cost at the discounted price. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
So, the total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the savings, we subtract the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will make a person grow in 15 days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will get.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to see how many times they'll get an extra arm. 15 ÷ 3 = 5, so they'll get 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can divide 15 by 5 to see how many times they'll get an extra leg. 15 ÷ 5 = 3, so they'll get 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the extra arms and legs together: 5 + 3 = 8.

The person will grow 8 new limbs in 15 days."
"To find out how much money Theo has left to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the things he bought.

He bought 6 business suits, and each one costs $100. So, 6 * $100 = $600. He also bought 3 suitcases, and each one costs $50. So, 3 * $50 = $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the things he bought: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo had $6000 to spend on his trip. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total cost of the things he bought from his total budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we need to subtract that from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find out how many eggs the family eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each group eats and add them together.

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day. So, they eat 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, they eat 9 x 7 = 63 eggs in a week.

The other 2 people eat 2 eggs each day. So, they eat 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day. In a week, they eat 4 x 7 = 28 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs eaten in a week, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 63 + 28 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"So, we know that Quinn is 30 years old. We also know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, which means Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 

Now, we need to find Trent's age. Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we add 5 to Jane's age. So, Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the current population of Chile, we need to figure out some things first.

We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is 46 years old now, we can find out how old Cera was six years ago. We subtract 6 from 46 to get Cera's age six years ago: 46 - 6 = 40.

Now, we know that six years ago, Noah was 40 years old. We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago. So, we multiply 40 by 3000 to get the population of Chile six years ago: 40 * 3000 = 120000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2: 120000 * 2 = 240000.

The final answer is: 240000"
"To find out how many players are on the defense, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of players on the defense is 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 x 6 = 12 people. Then, she invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 x 4 = 12 people. In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Unfortunately, 8 people couldn't make it to the party because they were sick. So, we need to subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who were supposed to come had other plans. 1/4 of 8 is 2. We need to subtract 2 from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we multiply the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"So, we know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. If there are 30 boys, then the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

We also know that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we need to add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children. 

30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to figure out how many groups of 3 electric wires there are. 

We know that there are 45 electric wires in total. To find the number of groups of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3.

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since each group of 3 electric wires needs 1 electric pole, we need 15 electric poles.

The final answer is 15."
"So, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 3 men left, the number of men who left is 3. We can find this by subtracting 22 from 25.

Now, we need to find out how many women left. We know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women. This is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information. 

First, we know the book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can find the cost of the magazine by dividing the cost of the book by 2. So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine. So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils. Since each box has 24 pencils, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has by multiplying 3 (the number of boxes) by 24 (the number of pencils in each box) and then adding the 2 loose pencils.

3 * 24 = 72
72 + 2 = 74

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils. Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24.

120 / 24 = 5

So, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate two things: how much weaker it is because of the ice cubes and how much weaker it is because of the cream.

First, we need to figure out how many ice cubes were used. We know that the coffee was cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes were used, we divide 65 by 13. This gives us 5 ice cubes.

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes the coffee weaker. So, we add 15 to 60 to find the total weakening. 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, there are 5 people who come into the record store. They trade their old records for new ones, and they end up with 7 new records. 

Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to figure out how many old records they brought in. 

If each person gets 1 new record, then they must have traded 1 old record each. 

So, we multiply the number of people by the number of old records each person traded: 

5 people * 1 old record/person = 5 old records

The answer is 5."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

First, we find the number of junior programmers. The company has 100 employees, and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. To find 2/5 of 100, we multiply 100 by 2 and then divide by 5. 

2/5 of 100 = (2 * 100) / 5 = 200 / 5 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers. 

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and the salary of senior programmers is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total salary of junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month. The total salary of senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to figure out how many people were on the bus when it was leaving the terminal. We know that 7 people got off at the second stop, and there were 20 people heading to the third stop. 

If 7 people got off at the second stop, that means there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus when it was leaving the second stop. 

Now, we need to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To figure out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down what happens to him throughout the day.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he gives 14 lollipops to his friends. So, he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Later that night, he eats 3 more lollipops, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, in the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to figure out how much more charge it needs. Since the phone is already 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. So, to get 40% charge, we multiply 40 by 3:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the lollipops Erin already had to the ones her mom gave her. So, 7 (the lollipops Erin had) + 10 (the lollipops her mom gave her) = 17 lollipops.

Then, we subtract the lollipops Erin gave to Ella. So, 17 (the total lollipops) - 3 (the lollipops Erin gave away) = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"So, the customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. They get $1 off for every $20 they spend, and they got $1 off for every $20. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 $1 off rewards.

But then, they used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, we need to subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"So, Nick is choosing between two jobs. One job pays $15 an hour and he works 2000 hours a year. The other job pays $42,000 a year. 

To figure out which job is better, we need to calculate how much money he'll take home from each job. 

For the first job, let's do this: 
- He makes $15 an hour and works 2000 hours, so he makes $15 * 2000 = $30,000. 
- The government takes 20% of that, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 
- So, he takes home $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For the second job, he makes $42,000 a year. But, he has to pay $6,000 in property tax. So, he's left with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. 
- Then, the government takes 10% of that, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. 
- So, he takes home $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

The second job is better because he makes $32,400, and the first job makes $24,000. 

The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 is the same as 0.4 * 220. We can do this calculation to find the total number of ruined castles.

0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is 44."
"To figure out the cost difference between the two offers, we need to add the advance payment and the monthly installments.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Let's add them up: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24.

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4: 24 ÷ 4 = 6.

So, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers and fudge separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers. Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers, and he wants to make 8 batches. So, we multiply 30 ounces by 8:

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

Next, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge, and he wants to make 1 batch. So, we just need 70 ounces.

Now, let's add the amount of sugar needed for suckers and fudge together:

240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. If the initial price is $8 and it increases by 50%, we add 50% of $8 to the initial price. 50% of $8 is $4, so the new price is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year. If the price is $12 and it decreases by 25%, we subtract 25% of $12 from the price. 25% of $12 is $3, so the new price is $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to figure out how many hot dogs Thomas ate first. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 hot dogs for Thomas.

Now that we know Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, we divide that by 2 to find out how many hot dogs John ate. 6 divided by 2 is 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. So, 3 (John's hot dogs) minus 2 (Luke's hot dogs) is 1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the three groups have a total of 200 students. We also know that two of the groups are equal in number, and the smallest group is 10 students less than each of the other groups.

Let's say the number of students in the two equal-sized groups is x. Then, the smallest group would have x - 10 students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, the two equal-sized groups have 70 students each. The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

The correct answer is 60."
"To find out how many legs the animals have, we need to figure out how many chickens and cows there are.

Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

The final answer is: 160"
"So, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. Let's see how many balls he has at the end of the fourth week.

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

At the end of the fourth week, Josh has 6 balls. Then, he drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. To find out how many balls he has left, we subtract 1 from 6.

6 - 1 = 5

So, Josh has 5 balls to juggle on stage."
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the animals and the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since it weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits given by Laurel's friend, the new outfits received at the baby shower, and the outfits gifted by her mom.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 outfits. Then, she got 48 more at the baby shower, and her mom gave her 15 more.

To find the total, we add these numbers together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

The total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87."
"So, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more meters each day. To find out how much more he needs to run, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which is 1000. So, he will now run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

There are 30 days in June. To find the total distance covered in June, we multiply 6000 by 30. This gives us 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"So, we have three juice boxes: A, B, and C. The price of Juice Box A is $4. Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so it's $4 + $5 = $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so it's $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. That would be $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

First, let's calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs. There are 40 tables with 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these tables is 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs from the tables with 3 legs. There are 50 tables with 3 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these tables is 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of tables. 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to calculate the discount first. The discount is 40% of the original price of one shirt, which is $30. 

40% of $30 is 0.4 * $30 = $12. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt: $30 - $12 = $18. 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $18 * 2 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"So, the factory used to make tractors and now makes silos. They used to sell 10 tractors a day and made $100 each. Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 each.

To find out how much more they make now, we need to calculate the total amount they make from tractors and silos. 

First, let's find out how much they make from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Then, let's find out how much they make from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Now, let's add these two amounts together: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

The difference between what they make now and what they made before is $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: 10"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost of food, treats, and medicine per month.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month and food costs $25 per week, we multiply $25 by 4 to get $100 per month.

Next, we add the cost of treats, which is $20 per month. So, the total cost of food and treats per month is $100 + $20 = $120.

Then, we add the cost of medicine, which is $100 per month. So, the total cost of food, treats, and medicine per month is $120 + $100 = $220.

To find the total amount spent per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. $220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to add up the time for each activity.

Peyton has a 1-hour yoga class on Monday. On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 hours. On Wednesday, she has a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which is 0.5 hours. On Thursday, she has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, so it's half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, on Friday, she has 2 hours of errands.

Let's add the hours together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"So, April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. That means she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we add the number of pots for the daisies and the number of pots for the roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 at the beginning. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. 

First, let's add the amount she spent and gave away: $11 + $4 = $15

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21

So, Andrea saved $21."
"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to figure out the total time he spent on vacation. 

First, we know he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours. 

Adding these up, we get 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. This is the total time spent on these activities.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we know the total time spent on vacation is 50 hours. Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours. So, she earned 20 * $10 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, so she earned 15 * $5 = $75. 

Now, let's add her initial savings of $80 to her total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275. Then, we add $80 to that: $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much she still needs, we subtract her total earnings and savings from the price of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to figure out the height of the second tree first. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we add the heights of the two shortest trees together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

A round of mini-golf costs $5, and she wants to play once. The go-karts cost $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. The arcade tokens cost $5.

First, let's add up the costs: $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. We need to convert the cost of lollipops to dollars, so 25 cents is $0.25. 

The total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * $0.25 = $1. For 5 days, it's $1 * 5 = $5.

Since she saves the change, we subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

The final answer is $0."
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to follow some steps.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have had $8 initially. Since he spent $1.5 on candy, he must have had $8 - $1.5 = $6.5 left.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide $6.5 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4.33 pounds of candy."
"To find the son's age, we need to figure out how old he is. We know Carver is 45 years old, and he's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's call the son's age ""S"".

We can write an equation to represent this: 2S - 5 = 45. 

To solve for S, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation: 
2S - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2S = 50

Now, we need to divide both sides by 2 to find S:
2S / 2 = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

The final answer is 25."
"So, the train travels from city A to city B, then city B to city C, and then city C back to city A. The distance from city A to city B is 75 miles, from city B to city C is 100 miles, and from city C to city A is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two parts. 

To find the total distance of one trip, we need to add the distances together: 75 + 100 + (100 - 50) = 225 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days, or 0.38 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round it to 1 day."
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing for each type of dog bed.

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. To find the amount of stuffing for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the two. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds. So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs 4 chihuahua beds, which will require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. He also needs 3 collie beds, which will require 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's find the time taken to drive to his friend's house. We know the distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to find the time taken for the detour. The detour is 10 miles and the speed is still 70 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 / 70
Time = 0.14 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Finally, we add up the times for each part of the trip to find the total time taken.

Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3
Total time taken = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

There are 96 students in total, and 9 students were absent. Since 5 of the absent students are girls, the remaining absent students must be boys. So, the number of absent boys is 9 - 5 = 4.

Now, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of students to find the number of boys present. 

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

So, there were 87 boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to know how many boys are there. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can divide the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To pass the school year, Jane needs at least 42 points from the 3 tests. She already got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. We need to find out how many points she needs on the third test.

Let's subtract the points she already got from the total points she needs: 42 - 15 - 18 = 9

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many people were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out.

First, let's calculate the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Since it's four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5, we do the following calculation: 4 * 3 - 5 = 7.

Next, we multiply the number of people kicked out for shoplifting by 3 to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence: 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we subtract the people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out: 50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = 19.

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points Sara had first. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can say Erin had 3 times the points Sara had.

We know Erin scored 14 points, and we need to find out how many points Sara had. Let's call the points Sara had ""x"". Then, Erin had 3x points.

We can set up an equation: 3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 ÷ 3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to 4 or 5. But we need to choose the option that makes sense in the context of the problem.

Let's think about it: if Sara had 4 points, then Erin would have 3 * 4 = 12 points. But Erin scored 14 points, so Sara must have had more than 4 points. If Sara had 5 points, then Erin would have 3 * 5 = 15 points, which is more than Erin scored. However, if Sara had 4 points, Erin would have 3 * 4 = 12 points, which is less than Erin scored. 

So, Sara must have had 5 points. Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 5
Erin's points before = 15

The correct answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880. Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 11 officers, and each cord costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost is $400. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20. 

$400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$400 - $80 = $320

The total cost for the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours for each day.

Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. So, Saturday's practice is 1 x 2 = 2 hours.

Total hours per week = 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment, and 40% of the total number were faulty. This means 40% of 400,000 is the amount of faulty equipment. To find 40% of 400,000, we multiply 400,000 by 0.4.

0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

So, there are 160,000 faulty pieces of equipment. To find the number of functioning pieces, we subtract the faulty pieces from the total number of pieces.

400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

Final answer: $240,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The answer is 45."
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know she started with 12 rolls. Then, she gave 6 rolls to her 6 children. So, we subtract 6 from 12 to find out how many rolls she had left: 12 - 6 = 6.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces each roll was cut into. The problem says she cut each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left (6) by the number of pieces each roll was cut into (8): 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils are left. We subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils: 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Next, we're told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. To find out how many pupils like green, we divide the remaining pupils by 4: 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

So, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To find out how many apples Lucy picked, we need to figure out how many she picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to know how many socks she has already washed. She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, that's 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, we need to subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total to find out how many she has missed. 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Let's do the math step by step:

1. First, we add the cookies Rachel initially had and the cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65
2. Then, we subtract the cookies eaten by her brother: 65 - 44 = 21

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final answer: 21"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to calculate the interest first. The interest is 10% of the $3,650 she borrowed. 

10% of $3,650 is $365. So, the total amount she needs to pay is $3,650 + $365 = $4,015.

Since Karan has to pay for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5. 

$4,015 ÷ 5 = $802

So, Karan has to pay $802 each month.

The final answer is $802."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply 14 by 8.

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. We multiply 9 by 5 to find out how far she hiked.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is 67."
"So, Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we need to add the silver and gold pesos. The total number of silver pesos is 50 + 100 = 150. The total number of gold pesos is 80 + 120 = 200.

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"So, Millie is opening a lemonade stand and she spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher can hold 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1 and sells an average of 4 cups per hour. 

To find out how many cups of lemonade she can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups. 

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36. 

Her total cost is $18, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18. 

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, she needs 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. 

So, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is $2."
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what number, when 3/5 of it is 12.8 hectares. Let's call that number x.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is 32."
"So, there are 52 people in the choir. Half of them are girls, which is 50% of 52. To find 50% of 52, I multiply 52 by 0.5. This gives me 26 girls. 

Since the choir is only performing with the girls, there are 26 girls. But then, half of the people performing can't make it to the show. To find half of 26, I divide 26 by 2, which equals 13. So, 13 girls can't make it.

The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 divided by 2, which equals 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, I'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils: 8 pencils * $3 = $24

Now, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36

The total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3 to find the number of messages to Mr. Yu.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we add the number of messages to Mr. Yu to the number of messages to Ms. Thompson to find the total.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22 = 88

The final answer is: $\boxed{88}$"
"So, David and Dasha went to the carnival. There are 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket. You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30, which gives you 9 rides.

If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?

To figure this out, let's look at the options:

A) David saves $12
B) David saves $18
C) David saves $30
D) David doesn't save any money

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. The ride bracelet costs $30, and the tickets cost $18. So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The correct answer is A) David saves $12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.

She has 144 inches of ribbon and 12 gifts in total. 

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide 144 by 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

We divide 165 by 11: 
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Since the ratio is 5:6, we multiply 15 by 5 and 6 to find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 15 * 5 = 75
Sam: 15 * 6 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"So, Tim wants to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. The other two services, Hulu and Disney Plus, normally cost $10 each, but he gets a discount because he's bundling them. The discount is 20% of $10, which is $2. So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we need to compare the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package. The cable package costs $60 per month, and the streaming services cost $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Let's calculate how much Tim saves:

$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is $42."
"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to add up all the time she spent on each task. She spent 4 hours writing, 1.5 hours recording, and 1.5 hours editing.

First, let's add up the time she spent on each task:
4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total time she spent editing. To do that, we'll divide the time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7 hours), and then multiply by 100.

(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

So, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns. 

6 x 6 = 36

Now, Wendy wants to put 20 more books than double the number of books that can fit in the system. To find double the capacity, we multiply 36 by 2.

36 x 2 = 72

Then, we add 20 more books to that number.

72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task."
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

So, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many slices of pizza Jenny has left, we need to figure out how many slices she gave away and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices. She gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. She started with 12 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

But then, Jenny ate 2 slices. So, we need to subtract 2 from 5. 5 - 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

The cost of the bike is $300, and Mark earns $10 per day. To find the number of days, we can divide $300 by $10.

$300 ÷ $10 = 30

So, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

We know there are 90 spiders. Since there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, we can find the number of millipedes by multiplying 90 by 1/3. This gives us 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we multiply 30 by 2 to get 60, and then subtract 12 to get 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to figure out their ages first. 

We know Erica is 30 years old. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we add 5 to 30 to find Beth's age: 30 + 5 = 35. 

Now, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we add 7 to 35 to find Alice's age: 35 + 7 = 42. 

The difference between Alice's age and Erica's age is 42 - 30 = 12."
"To find out how many calories John consumed, we need to do a simple math problem. 

First, we know that John drank 2 glasses of milk. Each glass is 8 ounces. So, we multiply 2 glasses by 8 ounces to get the total ounces of milk John drank. 

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Next, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce.

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to know how many days he works in a year. 

He works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so he works 4 * 6 = 24 days a month. 

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 * 12 = 288 days a year. 

He earns $50 per day, so his total earnings for the year would be 288 * 50 = $14400.

The answer is: $14400"
"To figure out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4. 

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so 3 * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup, so 1 * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk comes in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

"So, Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?

To find the energy saved, we need to first find the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day. So, the energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh).

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours. Mel now uses the AC for 3 hours a day. So, the new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy usage and the new energy usage: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

To convert Wh to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000. So, the energy saved per day is 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

The energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh.

The final answer is 4050."
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. Then, there's a zebra with 36 stripes. Lastly, there's another zebra with half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To figure out how much money Tyson will spend on meat and cheese, we need to calculate how much of each he'll need for 20 people.

Since each sandwich has 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to figure out how many steps he completed before his jog. 

He walked to and from school, which is half of his goal of 10,000 steps. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. Then, he did another 1,000 steps with his friend. 

So, the total steps he completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book. So, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, leaving 3/4 of the employees. 
3/4 of 40 employees = 30 employees
The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The taffy was on sale, so she got 2 pounds for $3. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, the price of the second pound is $3 - ($3/2) = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

$3"
"To find out how much Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package is twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find 20% of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 0.20. This gives us $240. 

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to think about how many cookies she eats in a day and how many days she wants to have cookies for.

She eats 2 cookies per night, and she wants to have cookies for 30 days. So, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 days to get the total number of cookies she needs: 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide 60 cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs. 60 ÷ 12 = 5.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to know the percentage of candles that explode. The problem says 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but it doesn't tell us if that's the same percentage that also explode.

However, let's assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that explode. We know that 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog. To find 5% of 50,000, we multiply 50,000 by 0.05.

50,000 x 0.05 = 2,500

So, 2,500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

2,500"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can find the discount by multiplying the regular price by 0.30.

The regular price of each blouse is $20. So, the discount amount is:

$20 x 0.30 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

$14 x 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3 times as many, which is 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write an equation to represent this:

T + S + A = 500

We know that T = 30 and S = 90. We can substitute these values into the equation:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

So, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 380"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dromedaries are in the herd. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. We also know that there are 180 heads in total.

Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. Since each camel has 2 humps, the total number of bumps (humps) is 2c. We also know that each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of bumps is also 'd'.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation: c + d = 180.

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304, so we can write another equation: 2c + d = 304.

Now, we can solve for 'c' and 'd'. Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Then, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to figure out the size of Zack's locker first. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can multiply 5 by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 14,000 feet (10,000 feet + 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

The difference in elevation is 14,000 - 3,000 = 11,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is 11,000."
"To find out how much money Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the money he already had to the money he got from the two banks.

He started with $5000. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $8000. So, we add $4000 and $8000 to $5000.

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To find out how many cats are left on the rock, we need to follow some steps.

First, 4 boats came and took away 5 cats each. So, we need to multiply 4 by 5 to find out how many cats were taken away. 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract 20 from the initial number of cats, which is 50. 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5. 30 * 3 = 90, and 90 / 5 = 18.

Finally, we subtract 18 from the remaining cats, which is 30. 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts.

First, we have the first 6 months, which cost $8 per month. We multiply $8 by 6 to get the total cost for these months: $8 * 6 = $48.

Next, we have the next 8 months, which cost $12 per month. We multiply $12 by 8 to get the total cost for these months: $12 * 8 = $96.

Lastly, we have the last 8 months, which cost $14 per month. We multiply $14 by 8 to get the total cost for these months: $14 * 8 = $112.

Now, we add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"So, Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. He had to choose between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Cole bought both and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's say the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many people can go on the day trip, we need to add up the number of people that can fit in each type of vehicle.

There are 4 buses that can hold 60 people each. So, 4 x 60 = 240 people can go on the buses.

There are 6 minibusses that can hold 30 people each. So, 6 x 30 = 180 people can go on the minibusses.

There are 10 minivans that can hold 15 people each. So, 10 x 15 = 150 people can go on the minivans.

Now, let's add up all the people: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people.

The total number of people that can go on the day trip is 570."
"So, Lillian wants to put up some bird feeders in her garden. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day. However, she notices that the birds prefer the feeders she made herself, which attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.

To find out how many birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find out how much Aleksandra paid for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each thing she ordered.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so it's $4 + $1 = $5. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so it's $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the things she ordered:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra paid $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the cards. He has $50 in spending cash and keeps 1/3 of the cards. This means he sold 2/3 of his cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.5, the amount of money he made from selling the cards is 1.5 times the number of cards he sold. Let's say he started with x cards. He sold 2/3 of them, so he sold (2/3)x cards.

We know that the amount of money he made from selling the cards is $50. So we can set up the equation:

1.5 * (2/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we need to first multiply 1.5 and 2/3:

(1.5 * 2)/3 = 3/3 = 1

Now, we have:

1x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 1:

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is 50."
"So, the caterer was supposed to prepare hotdogs for 36 guests. But, he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. That means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 to have one.

Then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. Since he had 18 hotdogs for the guests who were supposed to have two, that means he had 40 - 18 = 22 extra hotdogs.

These extra hotdogs were for the 22 guests who only had one hotdog. So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of 6 is 3. 

Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of all the items:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to find 20% of $165.00. To do this, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20.
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

$1"
"To figure out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps:

First, we know Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur killed three-fourths as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons. 

Next, Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he killed 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he killed 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The answer is 30."
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we can multiply 15 gallons by 8 pints/gallon to get the total number of pints.

15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Now, we need to find 1/4 of 120 pints. To do this, we can divide 120 by 4.

120 ÷ 4 = 30

So, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to calculate how much money he spent on chips and candy bars.

George spent $5, which is 500 cents. He had 1% of his money left, so he spent 99% of his money. 99% of 500 cents is 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents. We subtract this from the total amount he spent on chips and candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Now, we divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar, which is 75 cents. 375 ÷ 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"To find out how much cake is left, we need to subtract the number of pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total number of pieces.

There are 8 pieces in total, and 2 people had a piece. So, 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left.

Since each piece weighs 20 ounces, we multiply 6 by 20 to find the weight of the remaining cake.

6 x 20 = 120 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 120 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add Sitti and Juris's oranges together. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. There are 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to know how long it takes her to get to the theater. We know it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get there, and it takes 4 times as long for Bernadette. So, we multiply 4 by 4 to find out how long it takes Bernadette.

4 x 4 = 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to subtract 5 minutes from 16 minutes.

16 - 5 = 11 minutes

So, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width. We're given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. 

First, we need to find the width. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to calculate how much the temperature changes.

First, let's think about the oven. It's on for 3 hours and makes the house warmer by 5 degrees each hour. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to think about the window. When it's open, the house gets cooler by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 (because 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes) = 6 degrees.

Now, let's put it all together. The house started at 40 degrees. After baking, it's 40 + 15 = 55 degrees. Then, after cooling, it's 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it took James to do each part of the triathlon.

First, let's look at the swim. Jon took 40 minutes, but James finished 10% faster. To find James' swim time, we need to calculate 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40. 10% of 40 is 4, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, let's look at the bike ride. Jon took 80 minutes, but James took 5 minutes longer. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 10 minutes more than Jon's. We can set up an equation to find James' run time:

Jon's time = 40 (swim) + 80 (bike) + 50 (run) = 170 minutes
James' time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since James' run time is the same as the total time minus the swim and bike times, we can set up another equation:

James' run time + 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) = 180
James' run time + 121 = 180
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to figure out the length of Movie C first. Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To find out how much change Michael has, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the money he has.

First, we need to find out how far the horse ran. The horse ran for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. We need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile. Since there are 4 bales in a bail, the horse eats 2 bales of hay for every mile. The cost of the hay is:
2 bales * $3 per bail = $6 per mile

Since the horse ran 16 miles, the total cost of the hay is:
16 miles * $6 per mile = $96

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $96
Change = -$66

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $66.

The final answer is: $-66"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, each tray can hold 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 / 25 = 2.

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is 2."

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each and the rest for $25 each. 

First, let's find out how much he made from selling the sneakers at $20. 17 sneakers at $20 is 17 x 20 = $340.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he has left. 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.

He sold the rest of the sneakers for $25 each. 31 sneakers at $25 is 31 x 25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

There are 6 packets with 8 colors each, so we multiply 6 by 8 to get 48 colors. Then, there are 4 packets with 16 colors each, so we multiply 4 by 16 to get 64 colors. 

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

So, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is 112."
"To figure out the price of the popcorn, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $20 - $1 = $19.

We also know that the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3.

The final answer is: $7"
"So, there's this thing about filling helium balloons. The cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. Then, two days later, the price of filling each balloon went up by $20. We need to figure out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

To do this, we first need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon after the price increase. We can do this by dividing the original cost of 20 balloons ($900) by 20, and then adding the $20 increase. So, $900 ÷ 20 = $45, and then $45 + $20 = $65. This is the new cost of filling one balloon.

Now, we can multiply this new cost by 170 to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons: 170 x $65 = $11,100.

The final answer is: $11,100"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance it traveled and the total time it took.

The car drove 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, so the distance it covered in that time is 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drove 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so the distance it covered in that time is 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The car took 2 hours to drive the first part and 1 hour to drive the second part, so the total time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money all her jewels are worth, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she got.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 of them. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She got 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Since they each eat 4 apples a day, we can add 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day. Then, we multiply 8 apples per day by 30 days.

8 apples per day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

A raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together: 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply 32 by 10 to get the total volume of soil needed: 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we divide 320 by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs: 320 ÷ 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply 160 by $12 to find the total cost: 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to know how many green cards there are. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 

First, we find 60% of the number of red cards. 60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. 

The number of green cards is 15 (red cards) + 9 = 24.

Now, we know the number of red cards (15), green cards (24), and yellow cards (which is the sum of red and green cards).

The number of yellow cards is 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39.

The total number of cards is 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78.

The final answer is 78."
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events. 

First, 50 fairies were initially seen. Then, 20 minutes later, half of the initial number of fairies flew in from the east. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the initial 50. This makes a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

After that, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75. 75 - 30 = 45.

So, there are 45 fairies remaining."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

So, 35% of the puppies have spots."
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to add up the weight of all the feed he's buying.

He buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which weigh 2 pounds each. So, that's 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

He also buys 4 bags of carrots, which weigh 12 pounds each. So, that's 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.

The main food for the horses is hay, and he buys 42 bales of it. Each bale weighs 75 pounds, so that's 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.

He also buys 20 sacks of oats, which weigh 65 pounds each. So, that's 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights: 4 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 4400 ÷ 2250 = 1.96.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately.

She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her total earnings per week, we add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to figure out how many plants Toni has first. 

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants by finding 60% of 10 and adding it to 10. 

60% of 10 is 0.6 * 10 = 6. 
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total. 
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9

The final answer is 9."

The correct answer is $18."
"To figure out where Finley finished, let's break down what happened to her during the race.

She started in first place, but then fell back 5 spots. So, she was in 6th place. Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, which means she was in 4th place. After that, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which means she ended up in 6th place.

So, Finley finished in 6th place.

The correct answer is: 6"
"So, Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. To find the total number of basketball cards, we multiply 6 decks by 25 cards per deck, which is 6 * 25 = 150 cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. To find the total number of baseball cards, we multiply 5 boxes by 40 cards per box, which is 5 * 40 = 200 cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards and 200 baseball cards. So, the total number of cards is 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student got 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students. 300 / 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples they bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9.
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount.
Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8, so Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Let's start with the sheets. Each room has 2 sheets. Then, there's 1 comforter per room. Next, there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases per room. Lastly, there are twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels per room.

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items per room.

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of items per room by 80: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find out how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to follow the order of events.

First, he starts with 200 shoes. Then, he gets 5 pairs on Monday, so he now has 200 + 5 = 205 shoes. 

Next, he gains 15 pairs on Wednesday, so he now has 205 + 15 = 220 shoes. 

After that, he gains 30 pairs on Friday, so he now has 220 + 30 = 250 shoes.

Finally, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, so he now has 250 - 180 = 70 shoes.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to multiply the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

She has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, we multiply 6 jars by 8 cupcakes.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans Mary needs to bake these cupcakes. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To do this, we divide the total number of cupcakes by 12.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1.

The pen costs $2, so three times the price of the pen is 2 * 3 = $6.
The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it costs 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is 10 - 7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how many pencils are left, we need to follow some steps.

First, we know that there are 30 students in the class, and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils were used in two months. Since 1/5 of the pencils were used, we multiply 300 by 1/5. To do this, we can divide 300 by 5, which gives us 60 pencils used.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total to find out how many are left: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find this out, we multiply 240 by 1/3. To do this, we can divide 240 by 3, which gives us 80 pencils.

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up an equation: 

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. This will cancel out the 1/2. 

2 * (1/2)x + 2 * 2 = 2 * 5

This simplifies to:

x + 4 = 10

Next, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4

This simplifies to:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark. The remoras are 2 * 0.5 feet long, which is 1 foot. 

So, the total length is 10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (11 / 10) * 100
= 110%

However, since the remoras are attached to the shark, we need to subtract the length of the remoras from the total length to get the actual length of the shark. So, the correct percentage is:

Percentage = (10 - 1) / 10 * 100
= 9 / 10 * 100
= 90%

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of students, we need to figure out how many students have a desktop computer and how many don't. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. If we let the total number of students be x, then the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We also know that 20 students don't have a desktop computer. This means the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x. We can simplify this to (1/4)x.

Since we know (1/4)x = 20, we can multiply both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

The final answer is: 80"
"To break in a new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk for a certain amount of time each day. He has 3 weeks to do this. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we need to divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk for approximately 11.43 minutes each day for 4 days a week to break in his new shoes in 3 weeks.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to figure out how many books Sarah bought. We know that each book costs $15 and she spent $300. 

We can divide $300 by $15 to find the total number of books she bought. 

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both, as they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

We also need to add the 7 tour guides. So, the total number of people going on the tour is 600 + 7 = 607.

The final answer is 607."
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"

$240 - $20 = $220

The cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"To find out how many hours James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

James runs 12 miles a day and he runs 5 days a week. So, we multiply 12 miles by 5 days.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we need to find out how many hours he runs per week. We know that James runs 10 miles per hour. To find the hours, we divide the total miles by 10.

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day, so each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by 50 to find out how many bags: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64 inches. So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64 inches = 256 inches.

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches.

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64 inches. So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches.

The shortest girl is 60 inches tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 576 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576 inches / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is 48."
"Charisma works for 8 hours a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 8 * 5 = 40 minutes per day.

After 5 days at the office, she has walked 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The answer is 200."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to figure out how old she will be in four years. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

We know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's age in four years by 3: 18 * 3 = 54.

Now, we need to find Angela's current age. We subtract 4 from 54 to find her age: 54 - 4 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Paul drives twice a day, so we multiply the number of days by 2. 14 days * 2 rides = 28 rides.

The cost of his morning rides is $6 per ride, so we multiply 28 rides by $6. 28 * 6 = $168.

The cost of his afternoon rides is $2 per ride, so we multiply 28 rides by $2. 28 * 2 = $56.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides together. $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to know how many oranges they have in total. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make. 120 ÷ 3 = 40.

So, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 greek orange pies."
"To find out when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to think about the costs. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, and then $5 for each guest. The second venue charges $25 for each guest.

Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. We want to find when the costs are the same. So, we set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 20x

Next, we divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are needed for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many insects each person found. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 91 yards. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 182 yards. 

Total yards used = 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"So, Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each. To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the gifts for the two friends who want 5 gifts each. We multiply 2 friends by 5 gifts, which is 2 x 5 = 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the gifts for the three friends who want 2 gifts each. We multiply 3 friends by 2 gifts, which is 3 x 2 = 6 gifts.

Now, we add the gifts together: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. We add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to figure out the width of the rug first. We know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, we know the rug is 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, and the other 2 packs were grape and green apple. She paid $2 for the grape gum and half as much for the green apple gum. 

Let's say the cost of the green apple gum is x. Then, the cost of the grape gum is 2 dollars. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum, the cost of the green apple gum is x = 2 / 2 = 1 dollar. 

The total amount she paid for the grape and green apple gum is 2 + 1 = 3 dollars. 

Since she paid 7 dollars in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is 7 - 3 = 4 dollars. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to know which type of wood is cheaper. We have two options: 2 x 4 wood and 2 x 8 wood.

The 2 x 4 wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks. The 2 x 8 wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

Let's calculate how many sticks we can get from each type of wood for $24.

For 2 x 4 wood:
$24 ÷ $4 = 6
6 x 200 = 1200 sticks

For 2 x 8 wood:
$24 ÷ $6 = 4
4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Since 1600 sticks is more than 1200 sticks, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood to make more popsicle sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

There are 6 dogs, and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. 

We can multiply 6 (number of dogs) by 12 (cost per pair of snowshoes) to get the total cost.

6 * 12 = 72

So, the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs is $72.00."
"To figure out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week.

She takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, she takes 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips in a week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20. To find the total cost of 10 bus trips, we multiply 10 by $2.20. That's 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we need to know how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, the farm has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 45 + 80 = 125.

The final answer is 125."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. If we divide these numbers by 4, we get:

Onions: 12 ÷ 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 ÷ 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of items Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose 30 pounds.

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn a total of 3500 x 30 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 ÷ 183 ≈ 576 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories per day to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 576"
"So, Gerald works at a daycare and gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. To find out how much he made, we multiply the amount he gets paid per day ($30) by the number of days he worked (7). 

$30 * 7 = $210

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made. 

$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the number of laps she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer. 

She runs 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. So, we multiply 8 by 0.25 to get the total distance in kilometers. 

8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers

Since Hannah needs 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer, we multiply 2 kilometers by 60 milliliters. 

2 * 60 = 120 milliliters

So, Hannah needs 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is 0.20 * $500 = $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is 0.25 * $400 = $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3x + x = 120,000
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

So, the house cost $30,000."
"To find out how much profit Tara made, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount she got from selling the bags and the total amount she spent on buying them.

First, let's find out how much she spent on the bags. She bought 8 packs of 5 bags each, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Each bag cost $4, so she spent 40 * $4 = $160.

Now, let's find out how much she made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she made: $320 - $160 = $160.

So, Tara made a profit of $160."
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to multiply the number of punches he throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight.

He throws 25 punches per minute. There are 5 rounds in the fight, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total number of minutes in the fight is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of punches per minute (25) by the total number of minutes (15). This gives us 25 * 15 = 375 punches.

The final answer is 375."
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to figure out how many cookies Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Suzanne made 36 cookies, so Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Ali has $40 from the $10 bills and $120 from the $20 bills. To find the total amount of money he has, we need to add these two amounts together. 

$40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 

Now, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left. He uses 3/5 of this remaining amount to buy dinner. 

3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48. 

So, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left after buying dinner.

The final answer is 32."
"To find out how long it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to figure out how long it takes Rob first. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to turn that into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know Royce takes 40 minutes more than twice the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Twice the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate the total number of items for her 3 grandchildren. 

She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. 

For a hat, it takes 2 skeins of wool. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she'll need 3 hats * 2 skeins = 6 skeins.

For a scarf, it takes 4 skeins of wool. So, she'll need 3 scarves * 4 skeins = 12 skeins.

For a sweater, it takes 12 skeins of wool. So, she'll need 3 sweaters * 12 skeins = 36 skeins.

For a pair of mittens, it takes 1 skein of wool. Since there are 3 pairs, she'll need 3 pairs * 1 skein = 3 skeins.

For a pair of socks, it takes 2 skeins of wool. So, she'll need 3 pairs * 2 skeins = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

Martha will need 63 skeins of wool."
"So, Chris has 100 math problems to do. He does 12 on Monday. Then, he does 3 times as many on Tuesday, which is 3 * 12 = 36. So, he's done 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left. On Wednesday, he does 1/4 of the remaining problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13. So, he's done 13 more problems.

To find out how many problems he has left, we subtract 13 from 52, which is 52 - 13 = 39.

The final answer is 39."
"So, we have four people picking strawberries on Grandma Concetta's farm: Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky. We know how many quarts each of them can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby can pick 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky can pick 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we need to add up the quarts each person can pick. 

6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29.

The final answer is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, let's add the number of loaves sold: 93 + 39 = 132
Then, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68
Finally, we add the number of loaves returned: 68 + 6 = 74

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips, we divide 36 by 6. This gives us 6 rows of red tulips.

For blue tulips, we divide 24 by 8. This gives us 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we take the smaller number of rows, which is 3 rows.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

There are 27 cups of raisins in total. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins. To divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can think of it as dividing 27 raisins into 3 equal parts.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, Heather can make 9 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The correct answer is 9."
"So, Ada's daily electric bill is 12 kilowatts per hour. She's thinking of getting a new device that will use 2 kilowatts per hour a day. The price of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour.

To find out how much her bill will be, we need to calculate how much electricity she uses in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply her daily usage by 7.

12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours

Now, we multiply the total kilowatt-hours by the price of electricity to find her original weekly bill.

84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

Next, we need to find out how much electricity the new device will use in a week. We do the same thing as before.

14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

Now, we multiply the total kilowatt-hours by the price of electricity to find her new weekly bill.

98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

To find the difference in her weekly bill, we subtract the original bill from the new bill.

$147 - $126 = $21

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $21."
"To find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to think about how long it takes one person to paint a whole house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days. 

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 / 5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The answer is 48."
"To find out how many chairs Ophelia has, we need to figure out the number of chairs she has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's say Ophelia has x chairs. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We also know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, we can set up the equation:

20 = x - 2

To solve for x, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 20 + 2
x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

The total amount Tom paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought. $44 ÷ $4 = 11.

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

The correct answer is 11."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to add up the hours he worked each week.

He worked 4 hours for 5 weeks, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 hours. Then, he worked 5 hours for 1 week, which is just 5 hours. Lastly, he worked 6 hours for 1 week.

Now, let's add up the hours: 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 31 hours."
"To find out how many people are riding the bus after the second stop, we need to follow the steps:

1. There are 48 people on the bus initially.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off, so there are 48 - 8 = 40 people left.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off, so there are 80 - 21 = 59 people left.
5. 3 times fewer people get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. Now, there are 59 + 63 = 122 people on the bus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how old Jame and his cousin are now.

We know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, we can find Jame's current age by subtracting 5 from 27. Jame's current age is 22.

Now, we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Let Jame's current age be x. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 2(x + 8) - 5 years old.

We know that Jame's current age is 22, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(22 + 8) - 5 = 2(30) - 5
= 60 - 5
= 55

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we can find Jame's cousin's current age by subtracting 8 from 55. Jame's cousin's current age is 47.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to know the cost of the printer first. We know the computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the cost of the computer and the printer. The total cost of all three items is $2,400. We subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the monitors.

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 ÷ 2 = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"So, there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two groups - boys and girls. Since they are equal, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means they brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, each girl brought 30 seashells."
"So, let's solve this problem. We know that George has 3 candies left after eating some. We also know that he had twice as many candies as Nick. 

To find out how many candies Nick had, we need to figure out how many candies George had before eating some. Since George has 3 candies left, we can add the 5 candies he ate to find out how many he had initially. 

So, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before eating. 

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we multiply 8 by 2 to find out how many Nick had. 

8 * 2 = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we subtract 4 from 10 to get Alyana's age. 

10 - 4 = 6

Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age. 

6 + 2 = 8

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add those numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we need to subtract 54 from 72 to find out how many vlogs she still needs to make. 72 - 54 = 18.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To find out how much you paid, we need to calculate 20% of the dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10. 

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60. 

So, you paid a total of $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy had initially. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get $6 per boy. So, the eldest boy had $6.

Then, he added $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he added another $10 to his share, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Now, he saved some more money and tripled the amount he had left after spending $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is $39."
"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to know how much he saves in the first half. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the target for the second half of the month: 
$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's say he saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half. 

We know that the total amount saved in the first half of the month is equal to the total amount saved in the second half of the month, so we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half of the month. 

We know that the total amount saved in the first half of the month is equal to the total amount saved in the second half of the month, so we can set up the equation:
x * 15 = 2x * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = $562.50

Since Elvis saves $562.50 per day in the first half of the month, he will save 2x = $1125 per day in the second half of the month. However, we need to divide $1125 by 15 to find the amount he needs to save each day in the second half of the month.

$1125 / 15 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much change Verna got, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit she bought.

She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so that's 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so that's 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she got is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate how much each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"So, Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. We need to figure out how much Jeff gets.

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to think about the distance he walks to and from work. Since he walks to work and back, we need to multiply the distance from his home to work by 2.

The distance from his home to work is 3 miles. So, the distance he walks each day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, we need to multiply the distance he walks each day by 5. 

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many letters Elise has written, we need to add up the number of letters in each step.

First, she writes the alphabet in full twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Then, she writes half of it once, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"So, there's this phone tree thingy where Ali calls 3 families, and then each of those families calls 3 other families, and so on. We need to figure out how many families will be notified in the fourth round.

Let's break it down:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 families.
- In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 x 3 = 27 families.
- In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so that's 27 x 3 = 81 families.

So, in the fourth round, 81 families will be notified.

The final answer is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. So, the total weight he lost is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

To find his initial weight, we add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
= 70 pounds + 30 pounds
= 100 pounds

The answer is 100."
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys, so a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

So, Jonathan currently has 402 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
5 notebooks cost $1.50 each, so 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
2 pens cost $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
1 calculator costs $12
1 geometry set costs $10

Now, let's add up the costs: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

The store is giving a 10% discount on all the items. To find 10% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.10. 
$20 x 0.10 = $2

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $20 - $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how much Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

She bought 5 hamburgers at $4 each, so that's 5 x $4 = $20.
She bought 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, so that's 10 x $0.30 = $3.
She bought 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each, so that's 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add up the costs: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly paid with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

So, Carly gets $17 back as change."
"To find out how much money Antonella earned, we need to calculate two parts of her commission.

First, we find 30% of $1000. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by $1000. This gives us $300.

Next, we find 10% of the amount she sold over $1000. She sold $2500, so we subtract $1000 from that to get $1500. Then, we multiply 0.1 by $1500 to get $150.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $300 + $150 = $450.

So, Antonella earned $450.

The final answer is $450."
"So, Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. To find out how many bottles he has in total, we multiply 2 by 24. That's 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Now, Bill has 70 guests coming to his party, and he wants 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, we multiply 70 by 2 to find out how many bottles he needs in total. That's 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs. So, we do 140 - 48 = 92.

Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water for his party."
"So, we need to figure out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. 

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since he swims 1 mile in 16 minutes, we multiply that by 3:
3 x 16 = 48 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know he swims 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find twice the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day:
2 x 16 = 32
Then, we add 2 minutes to that:
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much money he makes in a week. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings are $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week.

Now, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save that much money.

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we multiply $40 by 3.

$40 * 3 = $120

The total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 x 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 x 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to figure out how big it is compared to the other lockers. 

First, we know Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's, we can divide 24 by 2 to find out how big Zack's locker is.

24 ÷ 2 = 12

So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches. Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

12 ÷ 4 = 3

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, we know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount of coffee. The daily recommended amount is not given, but we can call it x. Since Octavia drinks half of it, she drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups. This can be simplified to 5x cups.

Juan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract 4 from 5x.

5x - 4

We don't know the value of x, but we can leave the answer in this form.

The answer is: 5x - 4"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. 

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 hamsters. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to know their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the total angle the sun has moved upward.

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. After 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of 32 + 50 = 82 degrees from the ground.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to figure out how many candles he needs. 

One of his sons is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. James has two sons, so he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old.

Since James needs 4 candles and a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide 4 by 5 to see how many packs he needs. 4 ÷ 5 = 0.8. Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he'll need to buy 1 pack.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to know how many pages she read in the first week. We know she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total minutes by 1.5 and multiplying by 2.

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 
70 + 100 = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how old Shiloh's nephew is today. We know that Shiloh is 44 years old, and in 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew.

Let's say Shiloh's nephew is x years old today. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, let's solve for x. First, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

51 - 7 = 3x
44 = 3x

Next, we'll divide both sides by 3:

44 ÷ 3 = x
x = 14.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, Shiloh's nephew is 14 years old today.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

First, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"So, there are three teenagers playing soccer. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We also know that Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can subtract 20 from Richie's total to find Mark's total.

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can subtract 45 from Richie's total to find Anna's total.

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up their individual totals.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount Mitchell made from selling lemonades. 

We know Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find the total, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price of each lemonade.

21 lemonades * $4 = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam. We do this by subtracting the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

$84 (Mitchell's total) - $63 (Liam's total) = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"So, Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. He buys wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday, and plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday.

Let's first calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures. He buys 3 wooden action figures, and each one costs $5. So, he spent:
$5 * 3 = $15

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

Now, he buys plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday. He has $55 left, and each plastic action figure costs $2. To find out how many he can buy, we can divide $55 by $2:
$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures. To find the total number of action figures, we add them together:
3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the 4 broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Let's add these numbers together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"So, Ford has a garden where he grows roses. He gives some roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop gets 20 roses, the second shop gets 15 roses, and the third shop gets 30 roses every week. We need to figure out how many roses Ford doesn't have.

To do this, we need to know how many roses he gives away in total each week. We add the roses the shops get: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses the shops get each week by 4: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford doesn't have, we subtract the roses he grows from the roses he gives away: 260 (roses given away) - 160 (roses grown) = 100 roses.

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"So, Katina has $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to figure out how much money she'll have left after 2 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months. If she takes out $100 every month, she'll take out a total of $100 x 24 = $2400.

To find out how much money she'll have left, we need to subtract $2400 from $3000. $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The answer is $600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The food truck spends $3.00 on bread for 1 loaf, and 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread is $3.00. They also spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. The total cost is:

$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

$70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to figure out how many muffin crayons she can make. We know she has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. So, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin, which is $1.50.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

The final answer is: $9608"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by 7.

Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
= 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add half of the starting value to the starting value. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30. Then, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6.

Next, we multiply 6 by the starting value minus 12. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12, which equals 8. Then, we multiply 6 by 8, which equals 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"So, Maggie's oven is not working right. It's supposed to be 450 degrees, but it's actually 468 degrees. This means it's 18 degrees too hot. To find the correct temperature, we need to figure out what percentage the oven is off.

We can do this by dividing the difference (18) by the original temperature (450) and then multiplying by 100. This will give us the percentage.

18 ÷ 450 = 0.04
0.04 x 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find 4% of 520, which is the temperature the recipe calls for. To do this, we multiply 520 by 0.04.

0.04 x 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the time of each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. This gives us $22,800. 

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find Juan's house value. $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the combined value of both houses, we add their values together. $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"So, we know that 90 single-use contacts fit in one box and last for 45 days. Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off. We need to find out how much each pair of contacts will cost if Pete buys 2 boxes.

First, we need to find the price of one box after the discount. To do that, we calculate 10% of $100, which is $10. So, the discounted price of one box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90 = $180.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts are in 2 boxes. Since 1 box has 90 pairs, 2 boxes will have 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180 ÷ 180 pairs = $1 per pair.

The final answer is $1."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. She earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. He earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To figure out how much water Hannah needs, we need to know how many calories she burns. She does two things: aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does it for 2 hours, so she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories. Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she does it for 1 hour, so she burns 600 calories.

To find the total calories burned, we add the calories from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water. 1600 / 200 = 8.

So, she needs 8 times 100 ml of water, which is 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by 3.

Jared's typing speed started at 47 words per minute. Then, it increased to 52 words per minute. After that, it increased by 5 words again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.

Now, let's add up all the numbers: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 words per minute."
"So, there are two options for Martin's breakfast: Cheerios or donuts. If he eats Cheerios, he'll lose 1.25 pounds every week. If he eats donuts, he'll gain 1.75 pounds every week. We want to know how much his weight will be different after 5 weeks.

To find the difference, we need to calculate how much he'll lose or gain in 5 weeks. If he loses 1.25 pounds a week, in 5 weeks he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds. If he gains 1.75 pounds a week, in 5 weeks he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To figure out how many people are going to the event, we need to count the people Alex invited, the people she invited to invite their friends, and the people she invited to invite their spouses.

Alex invited 100 people. Then, each of those 100 people invited 2 friends, so we need to multiply 100 by 2 to get 200 more people. 

Next, Alex invited 10 of her friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, we add 10 (her friends) + 8 (their spouses) = 18 more people.

Now, we add up all the people: 100 (Alex's friends) + 200 (friends of her friends) + 18 (friends of her friends' spouses) = 318 people.

So, Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

First, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. So, the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to keep doubling the height of the beanstalk until it's taller than 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is now 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is now 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, we know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we need to figure out how many grams of protein he gets per week.

To do this, we first need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per day. We can do this by dividing the amount of mushrooms he eats (200 grams) by the weight of one cup of mushrooms (100 grams). 

200 grams ÷ 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Since each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup: 
2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

Now, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by 7: 
6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

The final answer is 42."
"So, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means if we take his age 5 years ago, and multiply it by 2, we get his current age. Let's call his age 5 years ago ""y"". 

So, we can write an equation: 2y = x

We also know that x = y + 5, because Jerry got 5 years older. 

We can substitute y + 5 for x in the first equation: 2y = y + 5

Now, let's solve for y. Subtract y from both sides: y = 5

So, Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago. Now, we need to find his current age. We add 5 to 5: 5 + 5 = 10

Now that we know Jerry's current age is 10, we need to find his age in 3 years. We add 3 to 10: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"So, George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. He also wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. He's already paid $600.

To find out how much he still needs to pay, we need to add the cost of the implants and the crown. The implants cost 2 x $2000 = $4000. Adding the crown, that's $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George already paid $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to know the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle ""x"".

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The second angle is 2x, which is 2(30) = 60 degrees. The third angle is 3x, which is 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to add up the value of all his coins.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"So, Jamaal was using an 8-pound weight at the gym. He increased the weight by 50%. To find 50% of 8 pounds, we multiply 8 by 0.5. 

8 * 0.5 = 4

Then, we add 4 to 8 to find the new weight. 

8 + 4 = 12

But Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, we subtract 2 from 12.

12 - 2 = 10

Jamaal now uses a 10-pound weight.

The final answer is 10."
"So, Steve gets 5 games for his birthday every year. Then, he buys 1 game per month for a year, which is 12 games. The next year, he buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. The year after that, he buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.

Let's add up the total number of games he gets each year:

Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games
Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) + 5 (Christmas) = 34 games

Now, let's add up the total number of games he has after 3 years: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel 2000 miles, we need to know its speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it already traveled (1200 miles) by the time it took (3 hours).

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this speed to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much chocolate they make together in a day, we need to know how much each person makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2, which is 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 as much as Ruiz in 1 hour. To find out how much she makes in 1 hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4, which is 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"So, let's break it down step by step.

Howard spent $8 at the arcade on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, he spent twice as much as he did on Monday, which is 2 x $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64.

To find out how much money he has left, we need to add up all the money he spent and subtract it from the original amount of money he had. 

The original amount of money he had was $100. He spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $88 in total.

Now, let's subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the money he made in each time period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To figure out how many years a tire will last, we need to know how many times it rotates per year. 

First, we know that the car drives 400 miles a month. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 400 miles by 12 to get the total miles driven in a year.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year ÷ 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we know the tire can do 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will last, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations ÷ 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 4362.5"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to figure out how many washings you get from 1 pump. If 2 pumps give 120 washings, then 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Since we want the cost in cents, we need to convert $12.00 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $12.00 is equal to 12 * 100 = 1200 cents.

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit. 

First, we need to find the discount on the shirt. The shirt costs $25 and there's a 30% discount. To find 30% of $25, we multiply $25 by 0.3. 

$25 * 0.3 = $7.50

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt: 
$25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. Let's assume the sales tax is 8%. We multiply the total cost by 0.08 to find the sales tax: 
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost: 
$52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50, so we subtract the total cost from the amount he had: 
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he won't have any money left.

The final answer is $-6.70."
"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we need to calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street.

The cost per meter is $194, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the things she bought.

She bought an aquarium for $10.00. Then, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. She also bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. 

Next, she bought 20 fish for $0.50 each, so that's 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

The total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

"To find out how many times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it has 1000 - 356 = 644 times left. The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 times left.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we add 644 and 865. 

644 + 865 = 1509

The final answer is: 1509"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. Since he went twice a week, that's 2 sessions per week. For 6 weeks, he went 2 * 6 = 12 times.

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To figure out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is 7."
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to add 4 to her current age. 

We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. So, we can find her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 + 4 = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the price of each one: 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the price of each one: 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts. To do this, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row. 

There are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. So, we multiply 10 and 20. 

10 * 20 = 200

Now, we need to find 4/5 of 200. To do this, we can multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5.

200 * 4 = 800
800 ÷ 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, we divide Ashley's speed by 1000 to convert it to Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply her speed by 60 to get the speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 6 cars per day (since it pulled 4 fewer cars per day). So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height.

First, we need to make sure both measurements are in the same units. Since the required height is in feet, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we divide Adam's height by 12.

Adam's height in feet: 40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Now, we subtract Adam's height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Since we can't have a fraction of a foot, we can round up to the nearest foot. So, Adam needs at least 1 foot to ride the roller coaster.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 1 foot. We know that Adam grows 2 inches per year, and there are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, we divide 12 inches by 2 inches per year to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 1 foot.

12 inches / 2 inches per year = 6 years

So, it will take Adam 6 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 6"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first.

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars. So the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the total cost minus the amount paid by the company, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find out how many surfers can stay upright on the big wave, we need to calculate 25% of 100. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25. 

40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to figure out the prices of gold and silver jewels first.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel. So, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel by multiplying 4/5 by $2000.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to figure out how many of each type of stamp he bought.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to figure out how fast Tom is getting closer to Bob. We do this by subtracting Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. So, we subtract 70 from 55 to get the difference in their speeds.

70 - 55 = 15

This means Tom is moving 15 miles away from Bob every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we need to divide the distance between them (75 miles) by the speed difference (15 miles per hour).

75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to figure out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. So, we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"So, Manny signed up for karate classes that cost $60. His parents said they won't let him take the classes if the cost per class is more than $10. There are 10 classes in total.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to think about it like this: if the cost per class is $10 or less, they'll let him take all 10 classes. But if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't let him take any more classes.

Let's think about the cost per class. If Manny takes 1 class, the cost is $60. If he takes 2 classes, the cost is $120, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 2 classes.

If Manny takes 3 classes, the cost is $180, which is even more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 3 classes.

If Manny takes 4 classes, the cost is $240, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 4 classes.

If Manny takes 5 classes, the cost is $300, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 5 classes.

If Manny takes 6 classes, the cost is $360, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 6 classes.

If Manny takes 7 classes, the cost is $420, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 7 classes.

If Manny takes 8 classes, the cost is $480, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 8 classes.

If Manny takes 9 classes, the cost is $540, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 9 classes.

If Manny takes 10 classes, the cost is $600, which is more than $10. So, his parents won't let him take 10 classes.

So, Manny can miss up to 9 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to know how many customers each person processes per day. Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie processes twice as fast, she processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

Now, we add the number of customers Jewel and Julie process per day: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050 customers per week.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how far Lynn ran. We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times as far as Paisley, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles.

We also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how far Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. Since one apple costs $5.20, we multiply 5 by $5.20 to get the total cost of 5 apples. 

5 x $5.20 = $26.00

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. Since one orange costs $3.30, we multiply 5 by $3.30 to get the total cost of 5 oranges.

5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together to get the total cost.

$26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $42.50."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the costs of all the features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"So, Tim gets a promotion and his salary goes up. He gets a 5% raise, which is 5% of his original salary. To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05. That's $1,000.

He also gets a bonus, which is half of his monthly salary. Half of $20,000 is $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his original salary. $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12. $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost 1/5 * $750 = $150.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 10 shirts, and each shirt costs $60. So, the total cost of shirts is 10 * $60 = $600.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $7500 + $150 + $600 = $9250.

The total cost of everything is $9250."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the information given:

Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. 

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find her total distance, we multiply the speed (12 miles per hour) by the time (4.5 hours). This gives us 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

Stanley biked 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find his total distance, we multiply the speed (10 miles per hour) by the time (2.5 hours). This gives us 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

Now, let's add their distances together: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig his well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil in 1 hour. Since he has to dig 24 feet of soil, we can divide 24 by 4 to find the time it takes.

24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so he can dig 2 feet of clay in 1 hour. Since he has to dig 8 feet of clay, we can divide 8 by 2 to find the time it takes.

8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time.

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig his well.

The final answer is: 10"

He gets 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

First, let's calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 classmates x 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cupcakes: 2 (for himself) + 2 (for his teacher) + 50 (for his classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"So, Fishio posted a selfie on Instagram and got 2000 likes after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means the new likes are 70 times 2000, which is 140,000.

Then, she got 20,000 more likes recently. To find the total number of likes now, we need to add the new likes to the initial likes. 

Initial likes = 2000
New likes = 140,000
Total likes = Initial likes + New likes
Total likes = 2000 + 140,000
Total likes = 142,000

The final answer is 142,000."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 off = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142."
"So, Ariadne has a shop selling two kinds of hats: red and green. She made $400 from selling red hats in one month. We know that the amount she made from red hats is half of what she made from green hats. So, if we multiply the amount she made from red hats by 2, we get the amount she made from green hats. That's 2 x $400 = $800.

Now, let's add the amount she made from red hats and green hats to find the total amount she made in the first month. $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find 3/4 of $1200, we can multiply $1200 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's ($1200 x 3) / 4 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the amount she made in the first month and the amount she made in the second month. $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find out how much James paid for the carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. He hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"So, Sally didn't get the full $300 she was supposed to get this week. Her bank account started with $200 and now has $420. We need to figure out how much was taken from her paycheck.

Let's subtract the amount in her bank account from her paycheck: $300 - $420 = -$120. This means she was short $120.

Since she was short, that means $120 was taken from her paycheck."
"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

She's inviting 16 guests, and each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves. So, we multiply 16 by 3.

16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide 48 by 2.

48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs she needs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find the number of dozens, we divide 24 by 12.

24 / 12 = 2

So, Lori needs 2 dozen eggs for her party."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

She has written 1/3 of the 15-page paper. To find 1/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 1/3.

15 * 1/3 = 5

So, Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left, we subtract 5 from 15.

15 - 5 = 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

The book has 200 pages, and Mike reads 10 pages a day. 

200 ÷ 10 = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

30 - 20 = 10

So, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"So, James buys a plane that costs $150,000. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hangar to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. To find out how much it costs him to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, and then add them together.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

So, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (first year's costs) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find out how long it took to cook all the food, we need to figure out the cooking time for each item. 

First, we know it took 30 minutes to cook the rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice, the pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for the beans is half the combined cooking time of the pork and rice. So, we add the cooking times for pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Then, we divide that by 2 to get the cooking time for the beans, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. To make it easier, let's convert these fractions to have the same denominator, which is 6. 

1/2 pound almonds = 3/6 pound almonds
1/3 pound walnuts = 2/6 pound walnuts

Now, we can calculate the cost of each:

Cost of 3/6 pound almonds = 3/6 * $10 = $5
Cost of 2/6 pound walnuts = 2/6 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Again, let's convert these fractions to have the same denominator, which is 15.

1/5 pound almonds = 3/15 pound almonds
1/3 pound walnuts = 5/15 pound walnuts

Now, we can calculate the cost of each:

Cost of 3/15 pound almonds = 3/15 * $10 = $2
Cost of 5/15 pound walnuts = 5/15 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to think about the number of legs and heads of the animals on the farm. Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'.

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4s + 2g = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation: s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations to find the number of sheep. Let's try to get 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute this expression for 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on the farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Roger is buying coffee and a donut. He needs a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. The regular coffee costs $5 per pound, but he's buying a more expensive kind that costs $6 per pound. 

To find out how much the coffee costs, we multiply 7 pounds by $6 per pound. That's 7 x 6 = $42. 

Then, he buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent.

The total cost of the chips is $4.00 (2 * $2.00). The total cost of the chicken and soda is $9.00 ($8.00 + $1.00). 

The total cost of the other items is $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00. 

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, the cost of the apple pie is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers.

Let's do the math:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we subtract the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

He attends class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the total number of hours he spends in class is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Since this goes on for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

It takes 1.5 hours to learn a new recipe. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe: 48 / 1.5 = 32.

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers. 

There are 150 teachers in total, and 60% of them are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6.

60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract 90 from 150.

Number of math teachers = 150 - 90 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping in one day.

Total time math teachers sleep = 60 * 6 = 360 hours"
"So, we know that Aurelia has $120. 

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which is (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars."
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

There are 4 quarters in a basketball game, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, we multiply 4 quarters by 12 minutes per quarter to get the total time of the regular game.

4 * 12 = 48 minutes

Then, we add the extra 5 minutes to the regular game time.

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find out how many employees oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of the total employees, and then find 30% of that number.

First, we find 20% of 50 employees. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20. 50 * 0.20 = 10.

Now, we need to find 30% of 10 employees. To do this, we multiply 10 by 0.30. 10 * 0.30 = 3.

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour, she needs 5 tablespoons per muffin. So, for 16 muffins, she would need 5 x 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, she needs 3 tablespoons per muffin. So, for 16 muffins, she would need 3 x 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, she needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin. So, for 16 muffins, she would need 0.25 x 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we add these amounts together: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: 132"
"So, we have three people - Robert, Cindy, and Aaron - and they want to share their candy equally. We need to find out how much candy each person will get.

Let's add up the amount of candy they have: 
Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. 
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.

Now, we need to divide the total amount by 3, because there are three people sharing the candy. 
12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

So, each person will get 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

He bought 7 candies of type A, and each one costs $0.5. So, the total cost of type A candies is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.

He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each one costs $0.75. So, the total cost of type B candies is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of all the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"So, Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. Then, the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's break it down:

- The first 8 days were good, so we subtract those from the total good days: 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.
- The next 3 days were good, so we add those to the remaining good days: 4 + 3 = 7 good days left.

So, there are 7 good days left in the month.

Final answer: 7"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to figure out the relationship between Janey's and Sally's books. We know Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. Let's say Sally has x books. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches, we need to figure out how many inches it needs to grow. We do this by subtracting the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 ÷ 30 = 12.

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is 12."
"So, James has a dog shelter with 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs come in, so now he has 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs a toy, James needs 12 toys.

But then, he comes back and finds out there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, he has 2 * 12 = 24 dogs now. However, 3 dogs are gone, so he's left with 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs a toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow some steps.

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 2 by 5, which is 0.4. Then we multiply 1200 by 0.4:
   1200 * 0.4 = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
   1200 - 480 = 720

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 2 by 3, which is approximately 0.67. Then we multiply 720 by 0.67:
   720 * 0.67 = 483.6

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:
   720 - 483.6 = 236.4

So, Skyler's investment was approximately $236.40.

The final answer is: $236.40"
"So, Carol and Jennifer are sisters who love collecting signatures from celebrities. They have been doing this for five weeks, and they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. 

Let's first find out how many signatures they have already collected. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. We can add these numbers together to get the total number of signatures they have so far.

20 + 44 = 64

Now, they want to reach 100 signatures. To find out how many more signatures they need, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to know how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 x 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. So, we can divide 96 by 6 to find out how many groups of 6 potatoes we have.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

This means we have 16 groups of 6 potatoes. Since each group makes 36 hash browns, we can multiply the number of groups by 36 to find the total number of hash browns.

16 x 36 = 576

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

Answer: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. So, the total weight of 9 adults is 9 * 80 = 720 kg.

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find out how much the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load, we need to subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

So, the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"To find out how many cookies everyone has, we need to figure out how many cookies each person has.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies:
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

We also know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies of all three:
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to figure out how long it was before Shania added the extra 20cm and made it 50% longer.

Let's say the original length of the dress is x. When she makes it 50% longer, it becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up an equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 20 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Now, we need to get rid of the 1.5 on the left side. We can do this by dividing both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time. 

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is 60 minutes. 
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is 40 minutes.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. They spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

First, let's add the time they've already spent walking: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

So, they have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

She bought 1 kilo of apples for $4. 
She bought 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, so that's 2 x $2 = $4.
She bought 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, so that's 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine paid a total of $14."
"So, Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta. To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we multiply 30 by 2, which is 60. 

So, the total number of cookies they baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we need to subtract 10 from 90 to find out how many cookies are left in the box. 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"Let's solve the problem.

We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's say the age of the younger triplet is x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number. The age of the older twin is 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To figure out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we do 10 x $0.40 = $4.00.

Next, we need to find the total cost of 10 candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so we can find the cost of one candy by dividing $3.20 by 4. $3.20 ÷ 4 = $0.80. Now, we multiply the cost of one candy by 10: 10 x $0.80 = $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Let's calculate how many coins they save in a year:
Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year

Now, let's calculate how many coins they save in 10 years:
Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

In total, Rong and Neil have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins after 10 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"So, John has his dog at the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. That's a total of 2 * $20 = $40 for the vaccines.

The vet also does a heartworm check. This check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is x. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

First, we know that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

There are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

To find the total number of squares, we add them together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet."
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we need to know how many regular chairs there are. We know there are 8 high chairs, and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. 

So, we multiply the number of high chairs by 5 to find the number of regular chairs: 
8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of adults and babies attending the function to find the total number of people: 
42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since there are 57 people and 40 chairs, Mia needs 57 - 40 = 17 more chairs.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to figure out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks by multiplying the total number of deer by 0.5.

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks. To do this, we multiply the number of bucks by 0.2.

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to add up the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 15, so Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 3 times 35 is 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip."
"So, Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids. Each of her kids has 3 kids of their own, which makes 3 x 3 = 9 grandkids. Now, each of those 9 grandkids has 3 babies of their own, so we multiply 9 by 3 to get the total number of great grandkids. That's 9 x 3 = 27.

There will be 27 great grandkids for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement. 50% is the same as 0.5. So, we multiply 0.5 by $2400 to get $1200.

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, we multiply 0.2 by $2400 to get $480.

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck. We do this by subtracting $1200 and $480 from $2400.

$2400 - $1200 = $1200
$1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

$720"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first find the total number of pencils in the box. 

Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply 15 by 20.

15 * 20 = 300

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 * 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply 3 by 5.

3 * 5 = 15

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard.

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135

The final answer is 135."
"So, there are 14 people going to the movies. Each person needs 2 drinks and 3 snacks. We need to find out how many drinks and snacks they bought in total.

To find the total number of drinks, we multiply the number of people by 2. 14 * 2 = 28 drinks.

To find the total number of snacks, we multiply the number of people by 3. 14 * 3 = 42 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we need to multiply the total number of drinks and snacks by 2. 
Total cost of drinks = 28 * 2 = 56
Total cost of snacks = 42 * 2 = 84

Now, we add the total cost of drinks and snacks to find the overall amount spent. 
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

When Gary joins, the three trucks can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

So, we subtract 8,800 (Gissela's and Gordy's trucks) from 11,600 (all three trucks): 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"So, there are 8 guys and 6 girls, and each guy ate 1 more dumpling than each girl. Since each girl ate 3 dumplings, each guy must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know that there are 8 guys, so the total number of dumplings eaten by guys is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 girls, and each girl ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by girls is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both guys and girls is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) into parts based on the ratio 3:2. This means we have 3 parts for Gerald and 2 parts for Julia.

We add the parts together: 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Now, we divide the total money ($100) by the total parts (5): $100 ÷ 5 = $20 per part.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so we multiply 3 parts by $20: 3 * $20 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this from his share: $60 - $10 = $50.

Gerald had $50 left."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

The cat's speed is 15 feet per second. So, the turtle's speed is 15 / 5 = 3 feet per second.

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to figure out how much more money they need to raise. They already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300.

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise the same amount every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they've already worked (3 hours) to find out how much they raise per hour.

$4200 ÷ 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work.

$4200 ÷ $1400 per hour = 3 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, the city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. But, 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. To find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes, we need to find out what percentage of the total water is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we find out how much water is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, we multiply 0.8 by 0.4. This gives us 0.32, or 32%. 

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total water is used for non-industrial purposes. We do this by subtracting 32% from 100%. This gives us 100% - 32% = 68%.

So, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 14 days x $12 per day = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find out how many quarts of ice cream are made in 48 hours, we need to figure out how many quarts each type of ice cream makes per hour.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we divide 100 by 2, which is 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we divide 50 by 4, which is 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To find the total bill, we need to add up the cost of all the items. 

The cost of 5 croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of 3 mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Adding all these amounts together, we get $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. To do this, we find 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to think about the deal she's getting. If she buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. That means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can multiply the cost of 2 scoops by 2 (since she's paying for 2 scoops) and then add the free scoop. 

2 scoops * $1.50 = $3.00
$3.00 + $0 (free scoop) = $3.00

Now, we need to see how many times $3.00 fits into Erin's $6.00. 

$6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2

So, Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 * 3 = 6 scoops). Since she gets 1 scoop free with each set, she can get 6 scoops in total.

The correct answer is 6 scoops."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is 24. Since he needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds. First, we multiply $1.5 by 30 pounds: $1.5 * 30 = $45. Then, we add the initial cost of $20: $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds. We multiply $2.5 by 30 pounds: $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to calculate the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. 

First, we find 10% of $700. To do this, we multiply $700 by 0.1. 

$700 x 0.1 = $70

Now, we add the 10% increase to the original price. 

$700 + $70 = $770

The new price of each computer is $770. To find the total amount paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers, which is 500.

$770 x 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs in the omelet, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we need to calculate the calories from the cheese. There are 2 ounces of cheese in the omelet, and each ounce has 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. There are 2 ounces of ham in the omelet, and each ounce has 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham. So, the total calories are 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet has 770 calories."
"To find out how much change you get, we need to calculate the total cost of the items you bought.

First, let's find the cost of the pencils. You bought 6 pencils, and each pencil costs $0.50. So, the total cost of pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's find the cost of the erasers. You bought 8 erasers, and each eraser costs $0.25. So, the total cost of erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

Now, let's add the cost of pencils and erasers together. $3 + $2 = $5.

You paid $10, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount you paid. $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is $5."
"To find out how many people accept the job, we need to follow the given percentages step by step.

First, we find out how many people get interviews. Since 30% of 100 people apply, we multiply 100 by 0.3. This gives us 30 people who get interviews.

Next, we find out how many of those people get a job offer. Since 20% of the people who get interviews get a job offer, we multiply 30 by 0.2. This gives us 6 people who get a job offer.

Finally, we find out how many of those people accept the job. Since a third of the people who get a job offer accept, we divide 6 by 3. This gives us 2 people who accept the job.

The answer is 2."
"To find out how much rice Goldy gave away, we need to know how many sacks she gave to her cousin and brother. We know she gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

So, we add 3 + 4 = 7 sacks. Since each sack weighs 25 kilograms, we multiply 7 sacks by 25 kilograms/sack to get the total weight of rice given away.

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

This week, she bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so the total number of boxes is 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference, we subtract 4 from 8: 8 - 4 = 4.

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply by the number of minutes.

When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are up, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. So, we need to calculate the total number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

For the 3 minutes when her arms are down, she taps 550 times per minute. So, for 3 minutes, she taps 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

For the 2 minutes when her arms are up, she taps 400 times per minute. So, for 2 minutes, she taps 400 * 2 = 800 times.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"So, Ron wants to fix the pothole in front of his house. If he doesn't fix it, it's going to cost him $450. But, if he fixes it himself, he'll get in trouble and have to pay a fine of $120. Plus, he'll have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that cost $25 each.

To figure out if it's better for Ron to fix the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing it. We add the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt: $120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the cost of not fixing it: $450 (cost of not fixing it) - $195 (total cost of fixing it) = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs that were sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. Let's add them together: 170 + 23 = 193.

Then, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair. There were 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs sent, so we add those together: 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, we subtract 33 from 193: 193 - 33 = 160.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 = -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this means that the friends ate more slices than the total number of slices available. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, so the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is (9 * 30 + 9 * 20) / (2 * 9) = (270 + 180) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows for both students' and teachers' cars.

There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows for students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64.

To find the total number of windows smashed, we add the number of windows for students' cars and teachers' cars: 256 + 64 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

There are 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. There are 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100. 

60 (blue spools) / 150 (total spools) = 0.4
0.4 * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To find out how many people hadn't voted by 4:00 PM, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 2/5 of the 5000 people had already voted by 12:00 PM. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 5000 by 2/5.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people had voted by 12:00 PM. Now, we need to find out how many people were left. We subtract 2000 from 5000.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, by 4:00 PM, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000

So, 2000 more people voted by 4:00 PM. To find out how many people hadn't voted, we subtract 2000 from 3000.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, 1000 people hadn't voted by 4:00 PM.

The final answer is 1000."
"To figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4).

30 days ÷ 4 pieces of gum per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

First, we need to find out how many smores the kids and adults will eat. There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 smores, so the kids will eat 9 * 2 = 18 smores. The adults will eat 6 smores. 

In total, they will eat 18 + 6 = 24 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide 24 by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to figure out their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8 to get her father's age.
2 * 15 = 30
30 + 8 = 38
Dora's father is 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age to get her mother's age.
38 - 4 = 34
Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

The final answer is: 87"
"To find out how much money each of Greg's siblings got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (4, including Greg).

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

Cindy has two math and science books that weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. She also has a French book that weighs 4 pounds and an English book that weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to figure out how many votes candidate B got first. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from 100.

100 - 23 = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples. Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.

90 - 87 = 3

The answer is 3."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's start by calculating the water used for each type of cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is 2."
"So, we know that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide Clara's total by 2.

20 ÷ 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books. Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We know Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can add 6 to Steven's total to find Alice's total.

10 + 6 = 16

Now, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total.

20 - 16 = 4

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. We have 10 gallon jars costing $5 each and 16 half-gallon jars costing $3 each. 

The total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
The total cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

To find the total cost, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we need to know how many like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15.

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - (10 + 15) = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of birds initially seen. 

1/3 of 12 is 4. So, 4 birds were scared away.

After that, 20 more birds joined the backyard. To find the total number of birds now, we add the birds that were left (12 - 4 = 8) to the new birds that joined (20). 

8 + 20 = 28

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to divide the total number of students by 2. 

80 students / 2 classes = 40 students per class.

Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 40 by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To find out how many slices of cake are left, let's break it down step by step.

Mara started with 2 slices of cake on the plate. Then, she added 3 more slices, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, she tripled the number of slices, which means she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After that, she ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend took 5 slices, so now she has 13 - 5 = 8 slices left.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals. 

She has 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. Let's add them up: 
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, we need to divide the total number of animals by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 
28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is 4."
"So, Mark bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. That's a total of 3 * $1800 = $5400.

He found some really valuable cards in the packs. One card was worth $4000 and another one was worth $1000. Plus, he got 30 more cards that are worth an average of $50 each. So, the total value of those 30 cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

Let's add up the value of all the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find out how much money Mark made, we need to subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

So, Mark made a profit of $1100."
"To find out how much money Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the cost of each park.

The first amusement park costs $26 for each adult and $12 for each child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:

$26 (adults) + $12 (children) = $38

The second amusement park costs $14 for each adult and $10 for each child. The total cost is:

$14 (adults) + $10 (children) = $24

To find out how much they will save, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:

$38 (first park) - $24 (second park) = $14

So, Jake's family will save $14 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $14"
"So, the tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for 50 cents each, but now he's buying them from a new vendor for 40 cents each. We need to find out how much money he saves per day.

To do this, we'll subtract the new cost from the old cost. 

500 tomatoes * 50 cents = 500 * 0.5 = $250
500 tomatoes * 40 cents = 500 * 0.4 = $200

Now, let's subtract the new cost from the old cost: $250 - $200 = $50

So, the vendor saves $50 per day.

To find out how much he saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"So, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. To find out how many marbles Cal has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 2. 

Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4. 

Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together. 

Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). 

Since 54 is not divisible by 12 evenly, we can divide 54 by 12 to get 4 with a remainder of 6. This means that 12 groups can only hold 48 students. To find out how many more students are needed, we subtract 48 from 54, which equals 6. Since each group has 6 students, we divide 6 by 6, which equals 1. 

So, 1 more group is needed to accommodate the remaining 6 students."
"To find out how many chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

There are 20 weekdays in a 4-week month (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200 chairs. 
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800 chairs.

To find the total chairs rented in a 4-week month, we add these two numbers together: 1200 + 800 = 2000 chairs.

Since we need to find the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find out how many bananas Gunther had, we need to follow the events that happened to the bananas.

First, we know Gunther started with 48 bananas. Then, Arnold took half of them, so we divide 48 by 2 to find out how many bananas were left. 48 / 2 = 24.

Next, Gunther added 25 more bananas to his pile, so now he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

After that, Arnold took 12 bananas, so we subtract 12 from 49 to find out how many bananas are left. 49 - 12 = 37.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, so now he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The answer is 43."
"So, there are 4 roommates and the electricity bill is $100 per month. To find out how much each roommate has to pay, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates.

$100 ÷ 4 = $25

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $25 by 12 to find out how much each roommate pays in a year.

$25 × 12 = $300

So, each roommate has to pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates, then subtract the number of broken ones.

Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, which is 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

Then, 10 glasses got broken and 6 plates got broken. So, we need to subtract those from the initial numbers.

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. So, she now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. So, she now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers. She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To find out how many matches Joey played in a week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so he played 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Let's add them up: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week."
"So, there's a council with 33 members, and they're voting on a new rule. The good thing is that the people who voted for the rule are more than the people who voted against it. Let's say the number of people who voted against the rule is x. Then, the number of people who voted for the rule is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and the people who voted for and against the rule must add up to 33. So, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 33.

To solve for x, we can combine the x's: 3x = 33. Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 11.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people who voted for the rule. We do this by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2(11) = 22.

So, 22 people voted in favor of the new rule.

The final answer is 22."
"To find the total number of shirts, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and then add them up.

Let's start with the extra-small shirts. 11 students need this size.

Next, we know that twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students.

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students.

Half as many students need size large as size medium. We divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students.

Six more students need size extra-large than large. We add 6 to 9 to get 15 students.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 is 0.05 x $140 = $7. 

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price: $140 - $7 = $133.

So, you will pay $133 after the discount."
"To find out how many hours the playlists will last, we need to do a little math. 

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist. There are 20 playlists and each one has 300 songs. So, 20 * 300 = 6000 songs in total.

Now, we need to multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song. Each song is 10 hours long. So, 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is 60,000."
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to figure out how many people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win first.

We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2. This gives us 10 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left. We subtract 10 from 50, which gives us 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.6. This gives us 24 people.

So, we know that 10 people think horse #2 will win and 24 people think horse #7 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract 10 + 24 from 50. This gives us 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The answer is 16."
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we need to figure out how many puppies are Pomeranians first. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's think about it: if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, that means the other 2/3 are boys. Since we know there are 6 girls, we can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians. We can think of it like this: if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are 6, then the whole group (1) would be 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians.

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we need to find out how many puppies Jana has in total. We know that 2/3 of her puppies are Pomeranians, so we can set up another equation: 2/3 * Total Puppies = 18. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us 18 * 3/2 = 27.

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"So, Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera that costs $200. We need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera.

First, we need to find out how much money Ava gave Jayden. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it by dividing $90 by 2.

$90 ÷ 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to figure out how many cases the first house needs. The first house needs half of the total 250 cases, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases.

Since the third house needs double the amount of the first house, we multiply 125 by 2. This gives us 125 * 2 = 250 cases.

So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how much they spent in total, we need to add up the cost of each item.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, she spent 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, he spent 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3.

Now, let's add up the costs: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The total amount they spent is $14."
"To find out how many fruits George has, we need to figure out how many more pears he has than bananas. Since he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate that.

First, we need to find 45% of the number of bananas George has. To do that, we multiply the number of bananas by 0.45. 

0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to the number of bananas.

200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290 pears

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits.

200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490 fruits

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. So, she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. 

To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to multiply the number of kilograms of oranges he needs by the cost of each kilogram. 

For 4 liters, he needs 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges. 

Since each kilogram costs $3, we multiply 20 by 3 to get the total cost. 20 * 3 = 60. 

So, Sam needs $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find out how many books they read altogether, we need to figure out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also add the number of books Ahmed read (150).

300 + 150 + 150 = 600

The total number of books read is 600."
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours = 20 hours
20 hours * $15 per hour = $300

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours
4 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Since Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns this bonus on both Monday and Wednesday. So, we add $5 * 2 = $10 to her total earnings for both days.

Total earnings for Monday and Wednesday = $300 + $60 + $10 = $370

The final answer is: $370"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents. Since there are 4 types of vanilla scents, we multiply 5 by 4 to get the total number of vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20.

For the fruity scents, there are 8 types, so we multiply 2 by 8 to get the total number of fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

So, the company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To figure out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first find out how much money he made from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so we multiply 20 by 3.

20 * 3 = 60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling eggplants, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount he wants to make.

$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To figure out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so her total weekend time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so we subtract that from her total weekend time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Then, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. 1/3 of 9 hours is 3 hours. So, she plays video games for 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by her total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time he spends at the museum.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum. We know the distance is 150 miles and his speed is 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed to come back home, it will take him another 2 hours.

The total time Jack spends driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will have left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels he needs for the cars and motorcycles.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. Then, we calculate the number of wheels for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels he will have left, we subtract the total number of wheels he needs from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels that will be left is 276."
"To find out how much you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is 0.20 * $1000 = $200. 

You subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800."
"So, Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions. He has 600 movies. A third of the movies are in series, and he can get those for $6 of the cost of a normal movie. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies that cost $5 each.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. We can do this by dividing 600 by 3:
600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies

Since Mike can get these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find out how much the series would cost if they were bought individually. Since a normal movie costs $10, the series would cost:
200 * $10 = $2000

But Mike can get them for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, so we need to divide the cost by 6:
$2000 ÷ 6 = $333.33

Now, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:
0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

These older movies cost $5 each, so we can calculate the cost of these movies:
160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies that are not in series or older movies. Since there are 400 movies left, and 160 are older movies, we subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

These movies cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. So, we can calculate the cost of these movies:
240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:
$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of peaches. He picked 6 pounds of peaches, and they cost $2.00 per pound. So, 6 * 2 = 12. He spent $12.00 on peaches.

Next, let's calculate the cost of plums. He picked 8 pounds of plums, and they cost $1.00 per pound. So, 8 * 1 = 8. He spent $8.00 on plums.

Lastly, let's calculate the cost of apricots. He picked 6 pounds of apricots, and they cost $3.00 per pound. So, 6 * 3 = 18. He spent $18.00 on apricots.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to figure out how far they hiked. 

First, we need to find out how fast they were hiking. We know they drove 50 miles per hour, and they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half of that. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the hiking speed by the time. So, we multiply 20 miles per hour by 1.5 hours.

Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To figure out who's better at the video game, we need to calculate their scores.

Let's say Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score is calculated by:
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 900 = 940

Ava's score is calculated by:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 30 + 4 = 34 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 34 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 1020 = 1835

The difference between their scores is 1835 - 940 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract 30 from 64: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide 34 by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

They ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of times for those days:
3 * 5 = 15

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 
So, the total number of times for these 2 days is:
6 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Bob had 7 fish in his pond initially. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He bought some more fish and ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to find the closest whole number. However, in this case, we can't find a whole number that satisfies the equation. But we can try to find the closest whole number.

Let's try x = 4. If x = 4, then the total number of white fish is 4 + 4 = 8, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + 14 = 17. This satisfies the condition of having twice as many orange fish as white fish.

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, we need to figure out how much money Andy's car is using per week. We know that his car goes 10 miles per gallon and gas costs $3 per gallon.

First, we need to find out how many miles Andy drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so we need to multiply the number of days by the distance.

5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we need to find out how much gas Andy's car uses in a week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven by the miles his car can go per gallon.

50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons

Finally, we need to find out how much money Andy spends on gas per week. We can do this by multiplying the amount of gas used by the price of gas.

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car uses $15 worth of gas per week."
"To find out how much money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties. She spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes is 5 * 22 = 110.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants. Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. So, the total number of eggplants is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits. 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: 142"
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to figure out how many non-OLED TVs were sold first. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

So, John is missing $150."
"To keep the pipes from freezing, we need to figure out how much the temperature needs to rise. The temperature is 45 degrees during the day and 33 degrees at night, so the temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4.

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, we need 3 logs to keep the pipes from freezing."
"To find out how many seashells the people brought back, we need to figure out how many groups were made and how many seashells each group brought.

There were 90 people in total, and they were divided into groups of 9. To find out how many groups were made, we divide 90 by 9.

90 ÷ 9 = 10

So, there were 10 groups. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10.

3/5 * 10 = 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply 6 by 2 to find the total number of seashells.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many people are on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people, and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

We start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. That leaves us with 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125, which gives us 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. That leaves us with 138 - 38 = 100.

So, there are 100 people on the train now.

The final answer is 100."
"So, Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find out how much money he makes in a month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Let's do the math:

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the number of days in the month: 10 * 30 = 300
Then, we multiply that by the value of each bottle cap: 300 * $0.25 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
For 3 hours, she earns:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"So, the company starts with 200 employees and gets 20 new ones every month. We need to find out how much money they pay in total after 3 months.

First, let's find out how many employees they have after 3 months. We add 20 new employees each month:

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

Now, we know they have 260 employees after 3 months. Each employee gets $4000 per month. To find the total amount of money they pay, we multiply the number of employees by the salary:

260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

So, the company pays $1,040,000 to its employees after 3 months.

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. 
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"So, Billy was paid $10 per hour when he first started working. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so now he's paid $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, so now he's paid $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

If Billy works 20 hours, he'll earn $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since Sally also works 20 hours, she'll earn $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each.

Three loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.
Two bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total score of both Pierson and Nikita. 
Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's find out how many students will plant trees. There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students.

Each student plants one tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's find out how many teachers will plant trees. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers in each class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers. So, 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to know the total number of stuffed animals she already has. Let's add up the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find 30% of 14, we can multiply 14 by 0.30.

0.30 x 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's try again. If the number of stuffed goats is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, we can set up an equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day for 14 days. 
Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days.
Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"So, we have two cars on the highway. One car is going 60 miles per hour, and the other car is going 70 miles per hour. We want to know how far apart they'll be after 2 hours.

To find the distance each car travels, we multiply their speed by the time. For the first car, that's 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles. For the second car, it's 70 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 140 miles.

Since the second car is going faster, it will be ahead of the first car. To find out how far apart they are, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled. That's 140 miles minus 120 miles, which equals 20 miles.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the cost of the gold. 

The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. 

$600 + $300 = $900

Then, we need to add a 30% premium to the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

There are 340 third-graders who passed out of 500, which is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%. 
There are 40 fourth-graders who passed out of 100, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The fifth-graders passed at a rate twice that of the fourth graders, so they passed 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400, which is 80/400 = 0.2 or 20%.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is 46."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to figure out how many square inches he can make with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, so we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 square inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the party, we need to figure out how much tea was consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's see how much tea the students drank. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so we multiply 4 by 1.5 to get 6 quarts. Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so we multiply 16 by 2 to get 32 quarts.

Now, we add the amount of tea consumed (6 + 32) to find the total amount of tea that was gone. 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, we add those to the amount that was consumed to find the total amount of tea at the beginning. 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). So, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to figure out how many he has left. 

Dale started with 100 candies and ordered 100 more. So, he has 100 + 100 = 200 candies in total.

Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many he has left, we subtract 150 from 200: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"So, there are 10 students at the beginning of the year. The number of students doubles every month. To find out how many students there are at the end of May, we need to double the number of students 4 times.

- At the end of January, there are 10 x 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, there are 20 x 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, there are 40 x 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, there are 80 x 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, there are 160 x 2 = 320 students.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to know how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 in a week and charges $0.25 per branch. 

First, we divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"So, John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?

To find out how many S'mores they can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Marshmallows left = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is 16."
"So, there's this new arcade that just opened up, and Jack decided to play with his friends. They played for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, so he played for 240 minutes. To find out how many quarters he used, we divide 240 by 20, which is 12 quarters. Since each quarter costs $0.25, Jack used 12 * $0.25 = $3.

One of his friends can play for half the time Jack can, so they played for 120 minutes. To find out how many quarters they used, we divide 120 by 20, which is 6 quarters. This friend also used 6 * $0.25 = $1.50.

The other friend played for the same amount of time as the other friend, so they also used 6 quarters and $1.50.

The last friend is really good and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. They played for 360 minutes. To find out how many quarters they used, we divide 360 by 20, which is 18 quarters. This friend used 18 * $0.25 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each friend: $3 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $4.50 = $10.50.

The final answer is $10.50."
"To find out how much oil Tanya uses, we need to figure out how much of each ingredient she uses. We know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Let's call the amount of salt used ""x"". Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest is x, and the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of fragrance is also x.

So, we can write an equation: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To figure out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

He needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Let's add those together: 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is 16."
"So, there are 20 students working together to raise money for a charity. The charity made a total of $175,000. But, $50,000 of that came from other organizations, not from the students. We need to find out how much money each student raised.

To do that, we need to subtract the amount from the organizations from the total amount. 

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Now, we need to divide the amount from students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

So, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy walked in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first.

She walked 8 hours on the first day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day, we need to divide 8 by 2 to find the time she walked on the second day. 

8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time. 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

First, we add the initial number of cars to the number of cars that arrived during the first break. So, 50 (initial cars) + 20 (cars that arrived) = 70 cars.

Then, we need to find half of the total number of cars. Half of 70 is 35.

To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars. So, 70 (total cars) - 35 (cars that left) = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the pay per task.

There are 5 tasks in each cycle, and John does 30 cycles a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of tasks per day by the number of days in a week to get the total number of tasks.

Total tasks per day = 5 * 30 = 150
Total tasks in a week = 150 * 7 = 1050

Each task pays $1.20, so we multiply the total number of tasks by the pay per task to get the total weekly pay.

Total pay per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we need to know how many points she scored in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 * 11 = 88.

She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought than dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is 52."
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 Magic Cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of cards:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has. Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

The final answer is 153."
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Next, we know she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, we multiply the number of green eggs by 2: 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

Then, we know she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, we know she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find this, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, she will lose:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we need to consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Milly will lose $8.

$8"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is 60."
"So, Boris has a chocolate factory and he makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month. In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars. The second week, he makes half as many bars as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. 

In the third week, he makes three times as many bars as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars. 

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to subtract the bars he made in the first three weeks from the total number of bars he makes in a month. 

The total number of bars he made in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. 

So, to find the number of bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract 36,000 from 50,000. 

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is 14,000."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to add up the time she spends on each activity.

She records 18 videos each week, and each video takes 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 72 / 60 = 1.2 hours.

She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs and 1.5 hours a week doing her makeup. 

Now, let's add up the time she spends on each activity: 1.2 hours (recording videos) + 2 hours (writing songs) + 1.5 hours (doing makeup) = 4.7 hours per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the time she spends on TikTok per week by 4: 4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is: 
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to figure out how much money his brother Anthony has. We know that Anthony has $10 more than their sister Eva, and Eva has $20. So, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's money, we multiply Anthony's money by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Finally, we add the 40% to Anthony's money to find Roy's money. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to figure out the heights of the other people first.

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift 12 times more than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times more than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times more than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time. Since Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, we can multiply this by the time he traveled.

For the first 4 hours, the distance is 8 * 4 = 32 miles.

For the next 6 hours, the distance is 8 * 6 = 48 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the two distances together: 32 + 48 = 80 miles.

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how fast the turtles are moving. We know that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. So, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway. We can use the speed of a turtle to find the time.

Time = Distance / Speed
We don't know the distance, but we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time for kangaroos = 18 hours
Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
18 = Distance / 3
Distance = 18 * 3
Distance = 54

Now we can find the time it will take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Time for turtles = 54 / 3
Time for turtles = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 18 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"So, there are three people making clay dishes for their school project. Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes, we need to add up the number of dishes made by each person. 

Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory made 40 dishes.
Jada made 80 dishes.

The total number of dishes is: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to figure out the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and getting some extra help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some money in her purse, and she got $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also gave her $80 to help. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's say the amount of money Erika has in her purse is x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 (the amount she still needs to buy the laptop).

x + 230 = 350

Now, we need to solve for x.

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

First, let's calculate the slices from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.

Next, let's calculate the slices from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples together: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so we need to subtract 15 from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

There are 15 apple slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide 25 by 5 (the amount of milk one cow produces per day).

25 ÷ 5 = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to multiply 5 by 3 to see how many cows he needs in total.

5 * 3 = 15

So, the farmer needs 15 cows in total. To find out how many more cows he needs, we subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows he needs.

15 - 3 = 12

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. Since the glue stick is 12 mm long, we need to find 1/6 of 12 mm. To do this, we can divide 12 by 6, which equals 2. So, 1/6 of 12 mm is 2 mm. This means the first glue stick has 2 mm left.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find 1/3 of 12 mm, we can divide 12 by 3, which equals 4. So, 1/3 of 12 mm is 4 mm. This means the second glue stick has 4 mm left.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find 1/2 of 12 mm, we can divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. So, 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm. This means the third glue stick has 6 mm left.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 12 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from working and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To find out how much change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

She paid with 4 $20 bills, so the total amount she paid is 4 x $20 = $80. The hat costs $70. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid: $80 - $70 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks he has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, we multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. To find the number of dishes Peter has, we divide the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's add up the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to know how many are good at both math and English. We know that 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only. 

Let's subtract the students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students. 

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7

So, 7 students are good at both math and English. Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to add up the time it takes for each group to get on stage, perform, and get off stage. 

Getting on stage takes 2 minutes, performing takes 6 minutes, and getting off stage takes 2 minutes. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We need to divide the total time by the time it takes for each group to perform.

120 minutes / 10 minutes = 12

So, 12 groups can perform in the concert.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the money she already has.

The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To find the answer, we need to know how many white shirts have no collars and how many floral shirts have no buttons.

We know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20. So, 20 white shirts have collars, which means 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts have no collars.

We also know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts, which is 50. So, 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. 

We have 900 eggs and each tray can hold 30 eggs. 

900 ÷ 30 = 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"So, Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.

Let's start by finding out how many goats are left in Farm X. If he sold 10 goats, then he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

Now, let's find out how many goats he sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y. That's 45 + 25 = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost of each pair, we divide $2640 by 24 pairs.

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food. Since each basket costs $25, we multiply 3 by $25:
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food. Each basket costs $18, so we multiply 3 by $18:
3 * $18 = $54

Now, we need to subtract $2 from the total cost of the red food because we get a discount. So, we subtract $6 from $54:
$54 - $6 = $48

Finally, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms, we need to know how many rooms that is. Half of 90 is 45.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, we multiply 45 rooms by 20 minutes:

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60 to get the time in hours:

900 ÷ 60 = 15

It would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that I am 3 years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. Let's use 'x' to represent my age.

My brother's age is x + 3, and my sister's age is x - 2.

We also know that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. So, my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87. We can write this as an equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The correct answer is 4."
"So, we have a river with 4000 gallons of water passing through it. Then, after a big rain, the water doubles, so now it's 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the water increases by 6000 gallons, so we need to add that to the 8000 gallons. 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14000}$"
"To find out how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add it to the total number of infected people.

Day 1:
- 10 people are initially infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 1: 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2:
- 70 people are infected from Day 1.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 2: 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3:
- 490 people are infected from Day 2.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 3: 490 + 2940 = 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"So, there are 40 customers who came into the restaurant, and each of them gave Rafaela a $20 tip. We need to find out how much money Julieta received as a tip.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can think of it like this: if Rafaela got $20, Julieta got 90% of that amount. To find 90% of $20, we can multiply $20 by 0.9.

$20 * 0.9 = $18

So, Julieta received $18 as a tip. Now, we need to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta. We add the tips they received:

$20 (Rafaela) + $18 (Julieta) = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. 

Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns half a badge per month. In 12 months, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In 12 months, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"So, Paige bakes 2 loaves of banana bread every hour. She bakes for 5 hours, from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. To find out how many loaves she bakes in total, we multiply the number of loaves she bakes per hour (2) by the number of hours she bakes (5). 

2 * 5 = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so we multiply the number of loaves by 8 to find the total number of slices. 

10 * 8 = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To find the total amount of money raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. 

80 * 0.50 = $40

So, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"So, Gretchen has some coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We know she has 70 gold coins. To find out how many silver coins she has, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30. We know the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70. 

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation. This gives us x = 40. Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many burritos are left, we need to do a simple math problem. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student got 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. To find out how many burritos are left, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos given to the students.

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many books each person has. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books, Anne has y books, and Sofie has z books.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

We are also given that together, they have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now, let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation. We'll start by substituting z = y + 25 into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, we'll substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To figure out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get.

There are 30 kids, and each kid will get 4 jello cups. So, we multiply 30 by 4.

30 * 4 = 120

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide 120 by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

120 ÷ 10 = 12

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much change the seller will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount of money they gave.

The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. So, the total cost is 5 * 700 = 3500 dollars.

The seller gave 4000 dollars. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: 4000 - 3500 = 500 dollars.

So, the seller will give back 500 dollars in change."
"So, Madeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries. They spend about $400 per month together. We need to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

First, we need to find out how much Keenan pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide $160 by 4.

$160 / 4 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2 and 60, then divide by 5.

2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To do this, we multiply 7 and 26, then divide by 13.

7 * 26 = 182
182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $8.00 = $16.00

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, and he wants to buy 16 of them. 

We can multiply the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts he wants to buy: 
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to figure out how much she earns per hour. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned in 3 hours ($33) by 3.

$33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: 
$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

First, we add the marbles Paul already had (52) to the marbles his friend gave him (28). This gives us 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, we need to find 1/4 of 80. To do this, we can divide 80 by 4, which is 20. So, Paul lost 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost (20) from the total marbles he had (80). This gives us 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many points Amy scored, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. 80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 points.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. 90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 points.

Lastly, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. 60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"To make a profit of $2000, Isaias has to sell the chickens he planned to take to the market from his farm at $50 per chicken. If Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them, how much money did Isaias buy the chicken he took to the market for?

To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we need to first find out how many chickens he sold. Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 300 is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

Since he sells the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he made from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. So, the total cost of the chickens he sold must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

To find out how much he bought each chicken for, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold: $7000 / 180 = $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade.

32 glasses ÷ 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's find out how much the chicken costs. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, a packet of chicken costs 2 x $10 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of chicken is 6 x $20 = $120. However, this is incorrect as the problem states the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so the chicken costs 2 x $10 = $20 per pack. So 6 packs of chicken cost 6 x $20 = $120.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts are, we need to figure out the total time of her final concert and then subtract the extra time she added for the encore.

The final concert was 65 minutes long, and she added 15 minutes for the encore. So, we need to subtract 15 minutes from 65 minutes.

65 - 15 = 50 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long her usual concerts are. Since the final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, we need to divide 50 minutes by 2.

50 ÷ 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find the total number of toys he gave away, we add 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is 50."
"So, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. They make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays. To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

First, let's add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays: 125 + 125 = 250.

Then, we need to find out how many chimichangas they make on Fridays. Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays, we multiply 125 by 2: 125 x 2 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find out how many microphones won't fit. 

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

So, the number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many birds are flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we need to multiply 6 (the number of birds in the bushes) by 2/3.

6 * 2/3 = 4

Now, we have 4 birds flying overhead. Next, we need to find out how many birds are feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding.

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

So, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"To find out how many cookies Lani had left, we need to subtract the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

She baked 55 cookies and ate 5. So, 55 - 5 = 50 cookies.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars she put them in. She put the cookies in 5 jars. 

50 cookies ÷ 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The answer is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. We have 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the daisies. We have 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, let's find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to divide the total number of plants by 4. 
100 ÷ 4 = 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3:
75 * 2/3 = 50

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to figure out how fast the thingamabob is spinning. We know that the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. If the whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second, we can divide 121 by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob. 

121 ÷ 11 = 11

So, the thingamabob spins 11 meters per second. Now, we know that the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. To find the speed of the whirligig, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

11 * 5 = 55

The whirligig spins 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to know the cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Ellen pays $11 in total for all her food. To find out how much she pays for the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total: $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"So, Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. His original pay was $10 an hour, but they raised it by $2. To find his new pay, we need to add the $2 raise to his original pay.

$10 + $2 = $12

Now, we need to multiply his new pay by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 hours per week.

$12 * 40 hours = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to figure out how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
702 - 80 = 622

The final answer is: 622"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how much profit John makes from renting his car, we need to calculate the total amount he earns and subtract his car payment.

First, we need to find out how many hours he works in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he works for 3 hours. So, the total hours he works in a month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much he earns in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total amount he earns is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Finally, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's solve the problem.

We know that Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph. If Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up an equation to find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.

Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation: 3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 ÷ 3
x = 2.33

So, Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

The answer is 4.67."
"So, Dijana and Anis went rowing on a Sunday morning. Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and add it to Dijana's distance.

1/5 of 50 is 10, so Anis rowed 10 more miles than Dijana. To find Anis's total distance, we add 10 to Dijana's distance: 50 + 10 = 60.

Now, we need to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis. We add Dijana's distance (50) to Anis's distance (60): 50 + 60 = 110.

The final answer is 110."
"So, Susan made 100 cookies for her nephews. But her husband ate 4 of them. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies that her husband ate from the total number of cookies.

Let's do the math: 100 - 4 = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each nephew will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"So, Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. He's making dinner for himself, his wife, and their 2 kids. Since there are 4 people eating dinner, that means 4 bowls will be eaten.

4 (total bowls) - 4 (bowls eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 kids and 0 bowls left, each child won't be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how much William spent, we need to add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

So, the total amount William spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

The final answer is $8."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can divide 20 by 4. 

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, 5 yards of material are needed for 20 small masks.

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can divide 8 by 3.

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 (round to 2.67, since we can't have a fraction of a yard)

So, 2.67 yards of material are needed for 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together.

5 yards (for small masks) + 2.67 yards (for large masks) = 7.67 yards

The final answer is: 7.67"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216 and the total number of tickets is 27. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

So, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to know how many hours are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which means he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left. Then, he works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Let's add up the hours he spends on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim has left, we need to subtract the number he used (3) from the total number of blue shoe boxes (7). 

7 - 3 = 4

Now, let's calculate the number of red shoe boxes he used. We know he used 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, we need to find 1/3 of 9.

1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The total number of shoe boxes left is: 4 + 6 = 10"
"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to multiply the number of books Sarah has by 2. 

9 * 2 = 18

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the total number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

So, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

First, we need to find 1/5 of 30. To do this, we can divide 30 by 5. 

30 ÷ 5 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out Adam's current age. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We also know that Duncan is currently 60 years old.

Let's say Adam's current age is 'x'. We can set up an equation based on the information given:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"So, Colby works in a factory and gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. To find out how many packages he completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour.

He completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"So, John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. We need to find out how many bottles of water he drinks in that time.

First, let's calculate the time for the extreme sudoku. We multiply the time for the normal sudoku by 4: 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the normal sudoku and the extreme sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks. 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons:
20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons:
58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there were:
18 ÷ 3 = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To figure out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate how many miles he drives in 30 days. He drives 100 miles a day, so we multiply 100 miles by 30 days.

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide 3000 miles by 1000 miles to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total, we need to add up the hours he works each day.

First, let's look at Tuesday. Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice as many hours as he did on Tuesday. So, he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. So, he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They spent $11 on a cake and $7 on 2 tubs of ice cream, so the total amount spent on these items is $11 + $7 = $18.

Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons, and each balloon costs $0.5, the total amount spent on balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl had initially. 

$24 / 2 = $12.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12."
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges Kira bought.

She bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. Let's add them together: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Then, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate, which is 2. So, 14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball. 

For soccer, we add the number of boys (16) to the number of girls (22) to get 38 students.

Now, we add the students from each sport together: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

The final answer is 56."
"To find out how much money the class raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

There are 30 students in the class, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300 lollipops.

Each lollipop costs $0.8 to buy, and they sold each lollipop for $0.8. The profit per lollipop is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

So, the class was able to raise $90 from selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

After that, he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To figure out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to know how many slices each person eats per day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

We add Abby's slices and Josh's slices to get the total number of slices eaten per day: 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6): 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows.

Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find out how many berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Since it takes him 4 hours to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find out how many trips he can make in that time.

8 ÷ 4 = 2

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 ÷ 2 = 12

So, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water will be left in the tank, we need to start by figuring out how much water is in the tank initially. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons of water and they fill the tank with half of that, we divide 10,000 by 2 to get 5,000 gallons.

Now, the tank is being emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water will be left after 6 days, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

So, we subtract 500 gallons for 6 days: 5,000 - (500 * 6) = 5,000 - 3,000 = 1,000 gallons.

The final answer is: 1000"
"So, Colby has $150 to spend at the movies every month. He already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, movie tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs. So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday). To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 ÷ 5 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance it traveled, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 x 5 = 300 miles.

The car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance it traveled, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 x 8 = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. To do this, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

The total number of toys Sophie already had is 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48.

The total number of toys Sophie now has is 62.

To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract 48 from 62.

62 - 48 = 14

The final answer is 14."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can write an equation to represent this:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's age and John's age. We can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

P + 10 = J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P = J - 10

Now, substitute P = J - 10 into the first equation:

(J - 10) + (J - 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3J - 20 = 100

Add 20 to both sides:

3J = 120

Divide both sides by 3:

J = 40

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:

P = J - 10
P = 40 - 10
P = 30

So, Peter's age is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight. At the start, she gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She also had 1 water balloon for herself. Then, her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

First, let's find the total number of balloons Maria and her friends had initially. Since there are 4 friends and each of them got 2 balloons, we can multiply 4 by 2 to get the total number of balloons they had:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Now, we add Maria's 1 balloon to the total:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), we multiply 5 by 3 to get the total number of additional balloons:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Finally, we add the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons to get the total number of balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how many tables the charity group needs, we need to figure out how many boxes they have in total. They got 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. They already have 10 boxes, so in total they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

But they already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many more tables they need. 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney to find the total distance. 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2. 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"So, Fern is trying to decide between two machines: the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

To figure out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate how many widgets each makes in a month. A month has 30 days, and there are 24 hours in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from each machine. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43,200 widgets, and each widget sells for $6, so it makes 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32,400 widgets, and each widget sells for $6, so it makes 32,400 * 6 = $192,000.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to figure out how much each animal needs and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. There are 15 goats, so the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for goats and sheep together: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The total amount of hay Nate needs is 159 pounds."
"Let's break down John's situation step by step.

John earns 50 dollars an hour and works for 6 hours. So, he earns a total of 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

After that, he wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the 100 dollars he has left. To do this, we divide 100 by 25.

100 ÷ 25 = 4

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left.

The final answer is 4."
"So, Craig and his brother are taking turns spelling out words and counting the number of letters in those words. They do this for 10 rounds. 

Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

There are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total. 

Total number of children = 8 * 7 = 56

So, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"So, there are 29 students in the class, and the teacher wants to give each student 2 bottles of apple juice. To find out how many bottles the teacher needs, we multiply the number of students by 2.

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher can get a total of:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher has left. We subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find out how much Patty charged for the job, we need to add up the cost of the visit, the labor, and the parts.

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and she charges $35 per hour. So, the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour.

2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Next, we add the fixed charge of $40 to the labor cost. $78.75 + $40 = $118.75

Then, we add the cost of the parts, which is $60. $118.75 + $60 = $178.75

So, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"So, James got 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. But he got them for 40% off. To find out how much he paid, we need to calculate 40% of $150 (10 CDs * $15 per CD).

40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60. So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90.

Then, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. He made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he paid.

Money James was out = $90 - $200
= -$110

Since James was out of money, the answer is -$110."
"To find out how much money Jen will make, we need to calculate the total value of each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the yams. She has 6 yams and each yam costs $1.5. So, the total value of the yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, let's calculate the value of the sweet potatoes. She has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato costs $2. So, the total value of the sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the value of the carrots. She has 4 carrots and each carrot costs $1.25. So, the total value of the carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Finally, let's add the values of the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James spends swimming the first part of the lake.
James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. To find 60% of 20 miles, we multiply 20 by 0.6.
20 * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining part of the lake.
James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 - 12 = 8) at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. Seven times that number is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. So, we need to subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

First, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many she has left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find out the total number of stickers she has now, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times. He sold 6 copies, and he gets a 10% commission on each copy. 10% of $5 is 0.1 * 5 = $0.50. So, the commission for the New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal. He sold 10 copies, and he gets an 8% commission on each copy. 8% of $15 is 0.08 * 15 = $1.20. So, the commission for the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Now, let's add the commissions together: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, to find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2. 

Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

The answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to figure out how many points Dinar scored first. Let's say Dinar scored x points. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points.

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points.

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

So, Dinar scored 15 points.

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to figure out how many pages are on each inch of the book. Since each paper is printed on both sides, that means there are 2 pages per inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

So, the book has 3 pages."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, which is 4 hours, and from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM, which is 11 hours. 

First, we convert the hours to minutes: 4 hours is 240 minutes and 11 hours is 660 minutes. Then, we add them together: 240 + 660 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled. 

900 ÷ 15 = 60

So, Vince stapled 60 reports."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time.

Now, let's find the time she went to sleep. She woke up at 2:15 a.m. and usually wakes up at 6 a.m. We can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time.

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3:45 a.m.

Now, we need to subtract the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time to find the time she was sleepwalking. 

10 p.m. - 3:45 a.m. = 6:15 p.m.

But we need to convert 6:15 p.m. to minutes. There are 12 hours in 6:15 p.m. So, 6:15 p.m. is equal to 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. Then, we add the remaining 15 minutes to get 360 + 15 = 375 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total minutes she slept on her bed that day.

375 minutes - 5 minutes = 370 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to figure out 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups:
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of unoccupied beds, we need to know how many beds are occupied at the start. 

The hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

Now, 50 patients are admitted each day. 

In 2 weeks (14 days), 50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted. 

The total number of occupied beds will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3. 

Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to figure out how many more people were in the audience than Kelly said. Kelly said Courtney made a mistake by saying there were 48 people, but she thinks it was actually 20% more than that.

20% of 48 is 9.6. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.20. So, 48 * 0.20 = 9.6.

Now, we need to subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people. 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To find the total number of balls, we need to figure out how many balls each person carried. 

We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey. So, Jeffrey must have carried half as many balls as Jason. That means Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we add up the balls carried by each person to find the total number of balls:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow the steps:

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. Then, they dug 13 holes on the second day. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes on the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is 87."
"So, Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but then they decided that only two people would get an equal amount, and the other person would get 15 more corn chips than the others. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. 

Since Collins got 15 more than the others, we can find out how many corn chips Collins got by adding 15 to the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey got. 70 + 15 = 85. 

Now, we need to add up the number of corn chips each person got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 50% of $400 is $200. So, we add $200 to $400 to get the cost of the travel.

$400 + $200 = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan caught 13 fewer than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe caught.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught A Pokémon. Then, Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokémon, and Alex caught 5 more than Stan, which is 4A - 13 + 5.

The total number of Pokémon caught is the sum of what each person caught, so we can write the equation:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339

This simplifies to:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan caught. Since Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokémon, we can plug in A = 40:

S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to know how many episodes there are. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can divide the total minutes per episode by 2.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to add up the brownies she made, got, and the ones her friends brought.

She made 12 brownies for herself.
She got 6 brownies at the office party.
Her friends brought 48 brownies to her home.

First, let's add the brownies she made and got: 12 + 6 = 18
Then, let's add the brownies her friends brought: 18 + 48 = 66

During the party, 18 brownies were eaten. To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to subtract the ones eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 of them, and it takes 15 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the polyester racquets. There are 5 of them, and it takes 22 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for polyester racquets is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for the hybrid racquets. There are 4 of them, and it takes 18 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for hybrid racquets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time for each type of racquet together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones) is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we add 7 to 13. 

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 + 20 = 33

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. So, we plug those numbers into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow some steps.

First, we need to know how many oranges she had initially. She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box has 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she had is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Next, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away 2 * 20 = 40 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find 1/4 of 240, we can divide 240 by 4, which is 60 oranges.

So, she had 240 - 40 (given away) - 60 (kept) = 140 oranges left. Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 140 oranges.

The final answer is 140."
"So, we're trying to figure out the total number of states in the USA and India. We know that India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA.

Let's start by finding half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Since India has 4 more states than that, India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we need to add the number of states in the USA and India together. The USA has 50 states, and India has 29 states. So, 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39. Tyler has saved $14. 

To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"So, there are three people - Richard, Jerry, and Robert - who are sharing 60 cherries. We know that Robert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we can subtract 10 from Robert's total.

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. We can do this by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Finally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We can do this by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Sunny made, we need to know how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total money he made for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total money for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150
Total money for Sunday: $90 + $90 = $180

Total money for two days: $150 + $180 = $330

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that his dad's age is twice Emil's age when he is 24. So, we can set up an equation: 24 = D/2, where D is the dad's age.

To find the dad's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that his brother's age is half of Emil's age when he is 24. So, we can set up another equation: 24 = 2B, where B is the brother's age.

To find the brother's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us B = 12.

Now that we know the ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12), we can find the sum of their ages by adding them together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The total number of beads Adrianne has is 90."
"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to add up the amount he caught each day.

Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday. Then, he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of that amount, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we multiply 30 (the total number of students) by 0.20. This gives us 6 students.

Next, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students to find the remaining students. 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find 25% of the remaining students to determine the number of cheerleaders or band members. We multiply 24 by 0.25, which equals 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early. 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"So, we know that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can find Charlie's boot size by multiplying 5 by 5. 

Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we need to find the average size of the two shoes. To do this, we add the sizes of their boots and divide by 2.

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot to get 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between each plant from the total length of the bed. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches. We subtract 18 inches from 1332 inches to get 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5. Since we can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is $552."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can multiply 18 by 1/2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63 pretzels per week

The answer is 63."
"To find out how much Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. She has 5 baskets and wants to put 3 petunias in each basket. So, the total number of petunias is 5 * 3 = 15. Petunias cost $3 each, so the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3 = $45.

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. She has 5 baskets and wants to put 2 vines in each basket. So, the total number of vines is 5 * 2 = 10. Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so the total cost of vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together. The total cost is $45 + $25 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers. They planted 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the soil used for the carnations. They planted 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations. 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They bought a 30-pound bag of soil. To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to figure out how long it takes her to do the job for 30 shrimp and then multiply that by 3.

Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel 30 shrimp.

It also takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.

So, in total, it takes her 5 minutes to peel and 10 minutes to cook, which is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to do the job for 30 shrimp.

To find out how long it takes her to do the job for 90 shrimp, we multiply 15 minutes by 3. This is because 90 is 3 times 30.

15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 45."
"To figure out how much the room temperature changed, we need to think about how the air conditioner worked.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour when it's on low. It was on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner gets turned up to high and cools the room 3 degrees an hour. It was on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

So, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees in total.

The room warms up 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is off. It was off for 2 hours, so it warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

This means the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Then, Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. Let's call this number x. We can set up an equation: x + 75 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 15. This means 15 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet.

Now, we know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. So, 15 years later, his dad would be 30 + 15 = 45 years old. Since Bill was three times his father's age at that time, Bill was 3 * 45 = 135 years old.

To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 years from 135. 135 - 75 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"So, Buford writes a check every month for his electric bill and gas bill, which is 2 checks per month. He also writes 2 checks to the church every month. And, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service every 3 months, which is 4/3 = 1.33 checks per month. To find the total number of checks he writes per month, we need to add these numbers together: 2 + 2 + 1.33 = 5.33 checks per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5.33 checks per month by 12 to get the total number of checks per year: 5.33 * 12 = 64 checks per year.

The final answer is 64."
"To find out how many flights the first plane makes to France, we need to know how many flights it makes in total. We know the second plane makes 44 trips, and the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which means it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the flights to Greece from the total flights: 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

The final answer is 22."
"So, there are three little wolves named Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. They howl at the moon every night. We need to figure out how long their howls last in total.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he got from his parents.

His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money Adam got from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"So, there are four kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age is the total age of all kids divided by the number of kids, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10. Now, we need to find the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Wilfred.

We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We also know the total age of all kids is 20. To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"So Walter is collecting money for charity. He starts by getting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he gets $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer is going to give him some money, but not as much as everyone else. The lawyer is going to give him three times as much as everyone else gives.

Walter already has $500 + $1500 = $2000. Now, his friend is going to give him $200. So, the total amount Walter has is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

The lawyer is going to give three times the amount Walter has, which is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"So, there were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought: 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Half of 1500 cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many people were in the church. Since each person got 15 cookies, we can divide 750 cookies by 15 cookies per person: 750 ÷ 15 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To divide the watermelon, we need to figure out how many slices each person gets. We know there are 2 adults and 4 kids. The adults get slices that are twice as big as the kids. Let's say the kids get x slices. Then, the adults get 2x slices.

Since there are 6 people in total, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 6. 

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the kids get 2 slices, and the adults get 2x = 4 slices.

Since the adults get bigger slices, let's say the kids get a slice that's y. Then, the adults get 2y slices.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of all the slices. There are 2 kid slices and 4 adult slices, so the total size is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. We know each adult gets 4 slices, and the total size of the watermelon is 10y. To find the percentage, we divide the size of the adult slices by the total size and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

So, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

He has 9 inpatients, and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, the time spent on inpatient rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

He also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60. 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available, which is 9 hours. 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To figure out what time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes, baking the cake takes 30 minutes, cooling the cake takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes), and frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. 

Let's add these times together: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold together. We know they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.

Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. We know this equals 64, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much the dance studio makes in a month, we need to calculate the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The studio costs $25 to rent per session, and it's rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. There are 10 students, so the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $60 = $360.

So, the dance studio makes $360 in a month."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4 to get 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to get 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can find the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to 9. This gives us 14 blue sticks.

Now, we know there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from 14 to find the number of yellow sticks, which is 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, we multiply 55 miles/hour by 4 hours to get the distance he traveled: 55 x 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, we multiply 45 miles/hour by 10 hours to get the distance she traveled: 45 x 10 = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. To do this, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
- Remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16: 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16: 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16

Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many laps each person can run. 

First, we know Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Then, we know Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Next, we know Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. 

Lastly, we know Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water left in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's try a different approach. Let's say the initial charge was x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) = x - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's try again. Let's say the initial charge was x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) = x - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = 16%

So, the initial charge of the power bank was 16%.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Janet gets a job as a waitress. She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips. She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. If she works 40 hours a week, how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?

To find out how much Janet needs to save, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car. 20% of $10,000 is $2,000.

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. Since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he actually spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0, he can't buy any plums.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away.

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. So, the new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means each album has 9 pictures. We know that 3 albums were selfies only, so we multiply 3 by 9 to find out how many selfies she had.

3 * 9 = 27

We also know that 2 albums were portraits only, so we multiply 2 by 9 to find out how many portraits she had.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to figure out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. 

We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 1 page, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes ÷ 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads: 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"So, there were 100 guests at the hotel initially. Then, 24 guests checked out early, which means 100 - 24 = 76 guests stayed.

After that, 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

Later, in the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. So, the total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, making the total number of guests 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is 98."

On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"So, there's a 60-question quiz. 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are divided into average and difficult questions. That means 60 * 0.4 = 24 questions are easy. The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36, and they're divided equally between average and difficult, so each type has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

Aries is going to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18 questions. She's also going to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9 questions.

To find the total number of questions Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions: 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold. We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'y' large stuffed animals and '2y' small stuffed animals.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, and she sold them for three times the price of a small stuffed animal. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is $12y, and the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is $8y (since each small stuffed animal costs $4).

The total amount earned is the sum of the amount earned from large and small stuffed animals: $12y + $8y = $120.

Combine like terms: $20y = $120.

Divide both sides by 20: y = 6.

Since y represents the number of large stuffed animals, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2y = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in a week, we need to add up the number of sandwiches each person eats per day.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Let's add them up: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 11 by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week.

11 * 7 = 77

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in a week.

The final answer is: 77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the twins found from the total number of eggs. The twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

We know that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs the friends found.

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by twins) - 10 (eggs not found by friends) = 30

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate how much ore they can mine in a day and then multiply it by 30.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

There are 30 days in a month, so the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich. We know that the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so we can divide $3 by 2 to get the price per sandwich. 

$3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are the same for all packages, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

$1.50 × 8 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom.

Tom spent $1000 on the bedroom set, so he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 x 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find out how many balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow some steps.

First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst.

Now, we have 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released.

Now, we have 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Sally found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"So, Marcus is trying to decide if he really needs to do his homework. There are a few things that could happen:

- There's a 50% chance that his normal teacher won't be there, and if that happens, he won't have to do the homework.
- If his normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension, so he won't have to do the homework.
- Even if his normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his homework, and she'll give him an extension.

To figure out the total chance that Marcus will have to do the homework, we need to add up the chances of these things not happening. 

First, let's find the chance that his normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher * 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
Then, let's find the chance that his normal teacher is there and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher * 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
Lastly, let's find the chance that the substitute teacher is there: 50% chance of a substitute teacher * 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the chances of these things not happening: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the chance that Marcus will have to do his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: 80%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would get, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, the total number of seats taken is 950 + 300 = 1250.

Now, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity: 6000 - 1250 = 4750.

There are 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would get, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates: 4750 ÷ 950 = 5.

So, each graduate would get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To figure out how many jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 75 large jelly beans fill him up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we multiply 75 by 2 to find out how many medium beans he can eat. That's 75 x 2 = 150 medium beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium beans by 3. That's 150 x 3 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is 450."
"So, Melissa has to go to court for 3 days and she works 6 hours a day. She gets paid $15 per day, but she also has to pay $3 for parking each day. To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Her daily income is $15, and her daily expenses are $3. So, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she works 6 hours a day for 3 days, we multiply her daily income after expenses by 3. $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much she makes per hour. To do that, we divide her total jury pay by the total number of hours she worked. $36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is $2."
"To find out how much Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the books. He bought 3 books for 16 dollars each. To find the total cost of the books, we multiply the number of books by the price of each book: 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the pencils. He bought 3 pencils for 6 dollars each. To find the total cost of the pencils, we multiply the number of pencils by the price of each pencil: 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find out how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to figure out how many bottles he can fit in his driveway. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet.

We can divide the width of the driveway by 3 to find out how many bottles he can fit:

24 feet ÷ 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box. 

There are 2 boxes, and each box has 40 apples. So, we multiply 2 and 40 to get the total number of apples: 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack, which is 8. So, we divide 80 by 8: 80 ÷ 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 x $11 = $22.
Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"So, Jim wants to go to college to make more money. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years. That's a total of $200,000. He also didn't work for 4 years, so he lost $25,000 per year. That's another $100,000. So, in total, he lost $300,000.

After college, Jim's salary tripled to $75,000 per year. To pay off the loans and the money he lost, he needs to earn $300,000. To find out how long it will take him, we can divide $300,000 by $75,000.

$300,000 ÷ $75,000 = 4 years

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money he needs to pay off the loans and the money he lost while in school.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person. To multiply 10 by 6.50, we can multiply 10 by 6 and then add 50. 10 * 6 is 60, and 60 + 50 is 110. So, the cost of the chicken salad is $110.

The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person. To multiply 6 by 6, we can simply multiply 6 by 6, which is 36. So, the cost of the pasta salad is $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $110 + $36. To add these two numbers together, we can count up: 110, 110 + 30, 140. So, the total amount Molly will pay is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"So, Johnny's dad went to the horse racing with him. His dad bet money, and they lost some in the first race. In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

To find the total amount lost, we add the amounts from each race: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Now, we need to find the average amount lost. We divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 ÷ 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. We can start by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities in each country: 26 * 5 = 130. Then, we multiply 130 by the population of each city, which is 1000.

130 * 1000 = 130,000

So, the total population of South America is 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 - 51 = 1

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find out how much the first person got, we need to divide the total amount of $1920 among the three people. 

Let's say the first person got x dollars. The second person got x + 80 dollars, and the third person got 2(x + 80) dollars.

We can add up the money the three people got and set it equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760 / 3
x = 586.67

So the first person got $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to figure out how many hours the whole team worked and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to know how many hours the team worked in a day. Since they worked 3/8 of a day, we can calculate that by multiplying 3/8 by 24 hours. 

3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 7 days. 

9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours by the number of painters. There are 4 painters, so we divide 63 hours by 4.

63 hours / 4 = 15.75 hours

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We also know that in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Let's call the number of balls retrieved in the second set ""x"".

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The car depreciates by 21% each year. 

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. Half of the books are written in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the books are written in German, so there are 10% of 50 = 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the total gallons:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, 120 people are on the train. Then, 20 more people board the train, so there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.

Next, 50 people get off the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people get on the train. So, there are 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.

Finally, 80 more people get off the train, so there are 190 - 80 = 110 people.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: 110"
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

She bought a tank top for $10. Then, she bought a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, so the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15. 

The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so she paid $48 / 2 = $24. 

She also bought a package of $8 athletic socks, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find out how much it will cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to figure out how many tiles you'll need. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, it covers 1 square foot. 

You have a kitchen floor that's 200 square feet. To find out how many tiles you'll need, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays a year for insurance, we need to calculate the increased cost first. 

The normal cost is $120 a month. We need to find 60% of $120. To do that, we multiply $120 by 0.6.

$120 x 0.6 = $72

Now, we add the increased cost to the normal cost to get the total monthly cost.

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James pays this amount for a month, we multiply it by 12 to get the yearly cost.

$192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"So, Greg does laundry for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can only handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. To find out how many loads he does in a week, we need to add the number of twin sets and the king set.

He does 2 twin sets and 1 king set, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply 3 loads per week by 52 weeks to get the total number of loads per year.

3 * 52 = 156

The final answer is: 156"
"So, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. That means they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

To find out how many movies they watch in a weekend, we need to add the number of movies they watch on Saturday and Sunday. So, 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies in a weekend.

If they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the number of movies they watch in a weekend by 4 (the number of weekends in a month). 6 * 4 = 24 movies in 4 weeks.

The final answer is 24."
"So, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Then, he got 50 more stickers last year. This year, he got twice as many stickers as last year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we need to add the stickers from all three years. We can do this by adding 100 (the stickers he had two years ago) + 50 (the stickers he got last year) + 100 (the stickers he got this year).

Let's do the math: 100 + 50 + 100 = 250.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

We can do this by using a simple division problem: 720 ÷ 60 = ?

Let's do the math: 720 ÷ 60 = 12

So, the cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many slices each person ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate. 

Let's say Jake ate x slices. Then, Becky ate x + 3 slices. We know Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long Betsy's part of the meal took, we need to know how long Donovan's part took. Let's call Donovan's part ""x"". Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part is x + 18.

The total time they took to make the meal is 98 minutes. We can set up an equation to solve for x:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The doctor charges $200 for the cast. Then, there's the visit, which costs $300 per hour, but it's only for 30 minutes, so we need to divide $300 by 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour) to get the correct cost. $300 / 0.5 = $600. However, we can simplify this by just multiplying $300 by 0.5, which is $150.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor gives 30 pills, and each pill costs $4. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Lastly, the doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, and the visit is for 2 hours. So, the total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find out how many emails he doesn't need to respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 x 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 x 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Let's add them up: 
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

The scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, let's add them up: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
Then, add 80: 300 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total by the number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. 20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. The glee club had 20 pizzas, so the football team had 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8. 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The answer is 14."
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

There are 700 small coupons and 2 times as many big coupons, so there are 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost of mailing a big coupon is 15 cents. 

The total cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. 
The total cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost of postage to dollars by dividing by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches. That means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches. So, we need to subtract 4 from 7. 7 - 4 = 3. This means there are 3 sub sandwiches left.

After that, Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. Now, we add 3 to 3. 3 + 3 = 6. So, there are 6 sub sandwiches in total.

Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs. To find the total number of meatballs, we multiply 6 (the number of sub sandwiches) by 4 (the number of meatballs per sub). 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is 24."
"So, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks that were carrying fertiliser to farmers. Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser. 

Later, he found out that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical problems and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. A quarter of 20 is 5. So, 5 trucks couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

Since each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser, the 5 trucks that couldn't deliver had 5 * 20 = 100 tons of fertiliser that didn't reach the farmers.

Now, we need to find out how much fertiliser did reach the farmers. We know 5 trucks couldn't deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is 20 - 5 = 15.

Each of these 15 trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to know how many pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find out how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy, we divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of guests first. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 21 additional guests, we multiply 21 by $6.

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to add the amount of money they each had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * 60 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
$120 - $35 = $85

The two of them have $85 left.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first figure out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 * 7 = 70 bananas
14 * 7 = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 - 168 = 147 bananas

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:
147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, if we assume she has enough money, we can calculate the change:
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

Since she can't buy the roses, she will leave with 0 quarters."
"To find out how much money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. So, 6 * $5.50 = $33.

Next, let's calculate the total sales from burger platters. He sells 9 platters for $11 each. So, 9 * $11 = $99.

Lastly, let's calculate the total sales from sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each. So, 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total sales: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to figure out how long each train is at the station and how long he has to wait between each train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 20 minutes for the first train.

The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for 5 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes for the second train.

The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves right after it arrives, so Paul will wait for 60 minutes for the third train.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train arrives.

Now, let's add up the waiting times:

- Waiting for the first train: 20 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 35 minutes
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes

Total waiting time = 20 + 35 + 60 + 80 = 175 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is 8."
"So, Mr. Rogers bought a $2000 watch for 75% of its original price. To find the original price, we need to divide $2000 by 0.75.

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for 120% of the price he bought it for. To find the sale price, we can multiply the original price by 1.20.

Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price. But in this case, the sale price is higher than the original price, so we need to find the percentage increase instead.

Percentage increase = ((Sale price - Original price) / Original price) * 100
Percentage increase = (($3200 - $2666.67) / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage increase = (533.33 / 2666.67) * 100
Percentage increase = 20%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend paid 20% more than the original price.

Final answer: 20"
"So, we have 5 springs, and each spring creates a new jellyfish every second. We want to know how many jellyfish they would create in 4 hours.

First, let's figure out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 4 hours. 

If one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, it would create 3600 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by 5. So, 3600 * 5 = 18000 jellyfish.

The answer is 18000."
"To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice that is 2 * 90 = 180. Then, we add 15 to 180, which gives us 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To find out how long it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours (to the store) + 1 hour (back home) = 1.5 hours.

The answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. If each banana costs $0.80, and she buys 40 bananas, the total cost would be:
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. If each bunch costs $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches, the total cost would be:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much fence Sam gets, we need to split the 100 feet between him and Harry. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can say that Harry gets x + 60 feet and Sam gets x feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how much it grows in one year. We know it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

So, we divide 8 inches by 4 years to get the growth per year. 8 ÷ 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth per year by the number of years. 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to know the prices of each type of bike and how many of each type he sold.

The price of a Trekking bike is $450, and the price of an MTB is $500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it's $250.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes. The rest were MTB bikes, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"So, there's a farmer who makes 5 bales of hay every hour. The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour. They both work for 6 hours.

To find out how many bales are left, we need to calculate how many bales the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

John attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

John also spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

So, John spends approximately 17.69 hours learning per week."
"So, Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. He drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high. We need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce.

To do this, we first need to find the height of the ball after the first bounce. Since the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, we multiply the initial height by 2/3. The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

Now, we multiply 72 by 2/3 to find the height after the first bounce: 72 x 2/3 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, we multiply 48 by 2/3 to find the height after the second bounce: 48 x 2/3 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much money the orchard made, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10). This will tell us how many bags they sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

So, the orchard made $1000."
"To find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, and that's half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 + 540 = 1620 kilograms.

Final answer: 1620"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"So, Ellen had 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 of the shaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

There are 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 11 sodas left. To find the probability, we divide the number of shaken sodas (2) by the total number of sodas (11). 

2 ÷ 11 = 0.1818 (or approximately 0.18)

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.18 × 100 = 18%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 18%."
"So, we have two trains going in opposite directions. One train is moving at 60 miles per hour, and the other train is moving at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. We want to know how far apart they are after 3 hours.

To find the distance, we need to calculate how far each train has traveled. The first train is moving really fast, so it will cover a lot of ground. We multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it's been traveling (3 hours) to get the distance: 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is moving slower, so it will cover less ground. We multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it's been traveling (3 hours) to get the distance: 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find out how far apart they are: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to figure out how many days he's available to help and then multiply that by how many people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars.

There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, the total number of people in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, the total number of people in the cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars. So, 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age. Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Next, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age. So, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide, we divide 300 feet by 60 feet/minute. This gives us 300 ÷ 60 = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, we divide 240 feet by 80 feet/minute. This gives us 240 ÷ 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time. To do this, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide. So, 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks. We can add these together to get the total time per day. 

First, let's add the lunch time and the break times: 
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (2 breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby takes this much time per day for 5 days. To find the total time, we multiply the time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to know how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Amber ran 8 miles. 

So, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran. 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance. 
52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which is $4.00. So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10, which is $3.00. So, the price of the towels after the discount is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the items she purchased:
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance on her credit card is:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The final answer is $113."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those change color. This means that 1/5 of the jellyfish are large, and 1/3 of those change color. To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to find the number of large jellyfish that changed color.

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up an equation to find the total number of large jellyfish. Let's call the total number of jellyfish ""x"". Then, 1/3 of the large jellyfish is x/3. We know that x/3 = 6, so we can solve for x.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 6 * 3 = 18. However, this is the number of large jellyfish that changed color. We need to find the total number of jellyfish, which is 5 times the number of large jellyfish. So, the total number of jellyfish is 18 * 5 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

We know Chris is 4 years old. 
Then, we know Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
Lastly, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to know how much she needs to save for her retirement. 

She saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. She wants to save for 20 years. 

First, we need to know how much she needs to save in total. Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can multiply this by the number of years she wants to save for.

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000

Now, we need to know how much she earns per year. She earns $100,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $400,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual income.

$400,000 / $100,000 = 4 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 4 more years to save for her retirement.

Final Answer: 4"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of equal parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into.

First, we divide 100 cm by 4. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we divide 25 cm by 5. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to figure out what number, when 40% of it is 240. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. We know that 40% of x is the same as 0.4x. We can set up an equation: 0.4x = 240. 

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4. 

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. Since we know there are 240 boys, we can do that:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the soil is $26. Let's add them together: $19 + $26 = $45.

Then, we need to subtract the discount of $7 from the total. So, $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the heights of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 heels that are 4 inches tall, so we multiply 3 by 4 to get 12 inches. Then, there are 3 heels that are 2 inches tall, so we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 inches. 

We add 12 and 6 to get 18 inches. There are a total of 6 heels, so we divide 18 by 6 to get 3 inches.

The average height of the heels is 3 inches."
"So, Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day, we need to divide the total miles by the number of days.

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day. To do this, we subtract 125 from 310.

310 - 125 = 185

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The correct answer is: 185"
"To find out how much money the store will get from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the cost of each color of balls and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the red balls. There are 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, 3 * $9 = $27.

Next, let's find the cost of the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, 11 * $5 = $55.

Lastly, let's find the cost of the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, 25 * $3 = $75.

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate a quarter of 12 kg for Pierre and 1/3 of 12 kg for Paul.

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 / 4 = 3 kg for Pierre.

1/3 of 12 kg is 12 / 3 = 4 kg for Paul.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount, we subtract 7 kg from the total 12 kg. 

12 - 7 = 5 kg.

So, Jacques will have 5 kg left.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, but that's not what we're looking for. We want to know the temperature in the morning, which is 3 degrees Celsius higher than the initial temperature.

So, we add the initial temperature (2 degrees Celsius) and the increase in temperature (3 degrees Celsius).

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature
= 2 + 3
= 5 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32. Then, he spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left."
"So, Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, which means she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. But then she also has $2 left, so she actually spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to figure out how long it takes for the light to blink once. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the time it takes for the light to blink once, we can divide 5 minutes by 255.

5 minutes ÷ 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we need to multiply the time it takes for the light to blink once by the total number of blinks we want to know the time for.

0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: 9.05"
"Let's count the number of male and female fish in Tate's garden pond.

There are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes initially. Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

To find the total number of male fish, we add the initial number of male guppies and male goldfishes: 4 + 3 = 7. Then, Tate buys 2 more male guppies, so the total number of male fish is 7 + 2 = 9.

To find the total number of female fish, we add the initial number of female guppies and female goldfishes: 7 + 5 = 12. Then, Tate buys 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so the total number of female fish is 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of female and male fish: 16 - 9 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how long it took all three to do their chores, we need to figure out how long each person took.

Amalia mowed the lawn, and it took her 4 hours. 

Megan walked the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. So, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior did laundry, and it took her 4 hours longer than Amalia. So, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to do their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance. 

First, we find the distance to his parents: 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total distance: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to figure out how far Sofie walks in 7 days first. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 by 7 to get the total distance she walks in 7 days.

10 * 7 = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we need to divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks.

70 / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To figure out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we need to know how many toys the first four workers make in total. 

Two workers make 6 toys per hour, and they work for 10 hours. So, they make 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. 

The other two workers make 4 toys per hour, and they also work for 10 hours. So, they make 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys.

In total, the first four workers make 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The order needs 220 toys, and the first four workers made 200. So, the fifth worker must have made 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can divide 20 by 10 to find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour. 20 ÷ 10 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"So, we have two dogs here. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs. One of them is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and the other is half the weight of Kory's dog.

To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we need to divide Kory's dog's weight by 4. That's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

For Elijah's second dog, we need to divide Kory's dog's weight by 2. That's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs together. We have 15 pounds for Elijah's first dog, 30 pounds for Elijah's second dog, and 60 pounds for Kory's dog. Adding them up, we get 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To figure out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards.

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to do a few simple math problems.

First, we need to know how many M&M's are in each bag. Since there are 30 M&M's in 1 ounce and John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To do this, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

So, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance around the earth by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The distance around the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to divide 20,000 by 400 (the distance Alfie flies each day) to find out how many days it will take him.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car can go 120 Miles per hour. Then, we know the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5 to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car: 120 * 5 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the 2nd fastest car is 600 Miles per hour. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply 600 by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 Miles per hour.

The faster car can go 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to figure out how old he was two years ago. We know that two years ago, Liam was twice as old as Vince. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

So, if Liam was 14 two years ago and that's twice Vince's age two years ago, we can divide 14 by 2 to find Vince's age two years ago.

Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age two years ago = 7

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago.

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number A. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

We can write an equation for the total number of eggs: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56. Since A = M, we can simplify this to 2A + 2S + 12 = 56.

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 2A + 2S = 44. We can divide both sides by 2 to get A + S = 22.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so S + (S + 12) = 30. We can simplify this to 2S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find A by substituting S into the equation A + S = 22. This gives us A + 9 = 22. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get A = 13.

Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can find the difference by subtracting A from C. We know C = S + 12, so C = 9 + 12 = 21. The difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately.

First, let's find the number of boxes Nik can fill with crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to get the number of boxes.

200 ÷ 8 = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we can divide 200 ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds.

200 ÷ 16 = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, which is 12.5 pounds. To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes.

Total weight = weight of crayons + weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate a few things.

First, we need to figure out how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs from 80% of the tree, we multiply 80% by 80 feet. 80% is the same as 0.8, so we do 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to get 16 logs.

Next, we need to find out how many planks he can make from each log. Since each log is cut into 5 planks, we multiply 16 logs by 5 planks per log to get 80 planks.

Finally, we need to figure out how much money he makes. Since each plank is sold for $1.2, we multiply 80 planks by $1.2 to get $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"So, Valerie's brother earns twice as much as Valerie. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, her brother earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mom earns twice their combined salary. To find their combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's salary: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, we multiply their combined salary by 2 to find their mom's salary: 2 x $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

Let's call the speed on the beach 'x'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

We know that 2 miles is walked at a speed of x, so the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the beach = (2/x) * 60 = 120/x minutes

We also know that 1 mile is walked at a speed of 2x on the sidewalk, so the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60.

Time on the sidewalk = (1/(2x)) * 60 = 30/x minutes

We know that the total time is 40 minutes on the beach and 30/x minutes on the sidewalk. We also know that the total distance is 3 miles, so we can set up an equation:

40 + 30/x = total time

We don't know the total time, but we know that the total time is equal to the time it takes to walk 3 miles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach and the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

(2/x) * 60 + (1/(2x)) * 60 = 3

We can simplify this equation:

120/x + 30/x = 3

Combine like terms:

150/x = 3

Multiply both sides by x:

150 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

50 = x

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = 30/x = 30/50 = 0.6 minutes

Now we can find the total time:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 0.6
Total time = 40.6 minutes

The final answer is: 40.6"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to calculate how much she has already saved. She saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to get the total amount she has saved so far.

$4 x 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount. 

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take. 

$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

There are 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21 blue birds. Then, there are 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8 blue birds. Lastly, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To find out how many marbles Bob has, we need to figure out how many marbles he had before he got 2 dozen more. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. If he got 24 more marbles and now has 60, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many marbles he had initially.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob had 36 marbles initially.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, and now he can drink the water.

We know that the total amount of water Donny has is 5 ounces. Since he poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is 0 ounces. So, the amount of water in the other mug is 5 ounces.

The temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, and the temperature of the water in the other mug is unknown. We can set up an equation to find the temperature of the other mug.

Let's say the temperature of the other mug is x degrees. Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the average temperature of the water is (33 + x) / 2.

We know that the average temperature of the water is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, 20 cows and 10 chickens are added. There are 21 days in three weeks.

Let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens added in 21 days:
Cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number of cows and chickens added:
Total cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"So, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack has 9 bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. To find out how much he'll pay in total, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack.

4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00

Now, Russell gets a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

$40.00 * 0.1 = $4.00

We subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Russell actually pays.

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we need to divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel.

$36.00 ÷ 9 = $4.00

So, each bagel will cost $4.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops. So, we can divide 3 by 2 to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop.

3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we are told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we subtract 5 from 23.

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Since we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we can multiply 18 scoops by 1.5 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in that time.

First, let's find out how many eggs he eats in the first 30 days. Since he eats 3 eggs a day, we multiply 3 by 30 to get 90 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. Since he eats 5 eggs a day, we multiply 5 by 30 to get 150 eggs.

Now, we add the eggs from the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs.

240 ÷ 12 = 20

So, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to figure out how many jellybeans are not green or red. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, which means there are 2 x 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, let's add the number of green and red jellybeans together: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree gives per year, and then multiply that by the number of years in a decade.

There are 5 trees, and each tree gives 6 lemons per year. So, we multiply 5 by 6 to get the total lemons per year: 5 * 6 = 30.

Since there are 10 years in a decade, we multiply 30 by 10 to get the total lemons in a decade: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is 300."
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we need to figure out how many women were on the bus initially. We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. So, the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We also know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Since the number of men is 5 parts, we can set up an equation to find the value of 1 part:

5 parts = 84

To find the value of 1 part, we divide 84 by 5:

84 ÷ 5 = 16.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 16.8 to 16 (as you can't have 0.8 of a person).

Now, we know that the number of men is 5 parts = 5 * 16 = 80.

The number of women is 9 parts = 9 * 16 = 144, but we know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up another equation:

9 parts + 5 parts = 84

Combine like terms:

14 parts = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

1 part = 6

Now we know that the number of women is 9 parts = 9 * 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to figure out how many bouquets he sold and then multiply that by the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday made $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets per day by 3. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers.

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each. So, the total cost is 100 rocks * $5/rock = $500.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his 100 rocks. To find 60% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.6. So, 100 * 0.6 = 60 rocks.

He sells each rock for $7. So, the total amount he earns is 60 rocks * $7/rock = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses. We subtract the total amount he earns from the total cost. So, $500 - $420 = $80.

Adam loses $80."
"To figure out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to think about how many days it will take her to draw each type of picture scene.

Let's start with the large-sized scenes. If she can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days to draw 45 large-sized scenes.

Next, let's look at the medium-sized scenes. If she can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.

Lastly, let's look at the small-sized scenes. If she can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to draw 49 small-sized scenes.

Since 9 days is the longest time it takes to draw any type of scene, that's how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project.

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

There are 4 children. 

So, each child receives 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.

The answer is 9."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to know how many days are in May. There are 31 days in May.

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, we multiply the number of days by the cost of food per day. 

31 days * $1/day = $31

Jen has 3 fish, so we multiply the total cost by 3.

$31 * 3 = $93

The final answer is $93."
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother and then add the number of roses she bought.

She started with 30 roses. Then, she gave 24 roses to her mom. To find out how many roses she had left, we subtract 24 from 30.

30 - 24 = 6

After that, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add 15 to 6.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. 

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. So, we divide 250 miles by 5 hours.

250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is 50."
"So, Mark buys two lottery tickets. One ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the other ticket is three times more likely to win. We need to find the probability that both tickets are winners.

To do this, we multiply the chances of each ticket winning. The first ticket has a 20% chance, which is the same as 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its chance is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the two chances together: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12. To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"So, there are three friends - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey - who are at the beach. They're collecting seashells. Jim has 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos has. Carlos has twice as many seashells as Carrey.

Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carlos has. We know Jim has 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos. So, we can subtract 5 from 27 to find out how many seashells Carlos has.

27 - 5 = 22

So, Carlos has 22 seashells.

Now, we know Carlos has twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey has y seashells. Then, Carlos has 2y seashells. We already know Carlos has 22 seashells, so we can set up the equation:

2y = 22

To solve for y, we can divide both sides by 2:

y = 22 ÷ 2
y = 11

So, Carrey has 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person has, we can divide them equally among the three friends. The total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so we multiply 4 carrots by 5 days to get the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays: 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

Mason also eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so we multiply 5 carrots by 2 days to get the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend: 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. We can find 60% of the first song's length by multiplying it by 0.6. 

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find out how much profit Linus made, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

He bought 2 devices on Monday for $20 each, so the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
He bought 4 devices on Tuesday for $20 each, so the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
He sold 6 devices in total, so the total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we subtract 2 from 7 to find Ned's height: 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so we add 1 to 5 to find Carl's height: 5 + 1 = 6 feet. 

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we divide 6 by 2 to find the length of the cane: 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

This doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of bottles. This means Hortex already produces more than the required amount.

So, the answer is 0."
"So, Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. That means 6 babies are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue.

Now, we need to find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple wearers and all the blue wearers are wearing bows. So, the number of purple bow wearers is 1/3 * 6 = 2, and the number of blue bow wearers is 2.

To find the total number of bow wearers, we add the purple bow wearers and the blue bow wearers: 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we need to find the percentage of babies wearing bows that are wearing purple. We do this by dividing the number of purple bow wearers by the total number of bow wearers and then multiplying by 100.

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers) * 100
= (2) / (4) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received in the first two days and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Let's start by adding the reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we need to subtract this total from the total number of reports received last week: 5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"Abraham has 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters of land for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sold 20 square meters of land for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sells this land for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 20 * 3 = $60.

Abraham initially earned $50 + $30 = $80 from the first two sales. He then earned an additional $60 from the last sale. In total, he earned $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of that is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years younger than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"So, Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day. He goes out 3 times a day. To find out how many face masks he uses in a day, we multiply the number of times he changes his mask (2) by the number of times he goes out (3). 

2 * 3 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of face masks he uses in a day (6) by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to know how many eggs each person found.

Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"So, John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. Two of them have 200 apartments each, and the last one has more apartments than the other two combined. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.

To find out how many apartments the last complex has, we need to calculate 60% of 400 (the total number of apartments in the first two complexes) and add it to 400. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits it produces each year.

In the first year, the tree produces 50 fruits. In the second year, it produces 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. In the third year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

The pattern continues, and we can calculate the number of fruits for each year:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100 and add it to the $100 Jack already had.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we let the yellow rope be Y, then the blue rope is Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 times (Y - 7).

We're also told that the three ropes together are 37 centimeters long. So, we can write an equation: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Let's simplify this equation by combining like terms. First, we'll add the Y's together: Y + Y + 4Y = 6Y. Then, we'll add the -7's together: -7 - 7 - 28 = -42. So the equation becomes 6Y - 42 = 37.

Next, we'll add 42 to both sides of the equation to get 6Y = 79.

Now, we'll divide both sides by 6 to find the value of Y: Y = 79 / 6. Y is approximately 13.17.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7. So, B = 13.17 - 7, which is approximately 6.17.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B. So, R = 4 * 6.17, which is approximately 24.68.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie. Since Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister.

1/5 of $15 is $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Now, Rissa had $15 and gave $3 to her sister. So, she is left with $15 - $3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie didn't give any money to her sister, she still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is $5."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pints of red paint were used. We know that there are four colors in the mural: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say that the amount of each of these colors is the same. Let's call this amount 'x'.

We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

Now, we know that the total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of all four colors. So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"So, Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before.

To find out how many clouds she counted in total, we need to add up the number of clouds for each day. Let's do it step by step:

Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 2 * 3 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 clouds
Thursday: 2 * 12 = 24 clouds
Friday: 2 * 24 = 48 clouds

Now, let's add them up:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, Alice counted 93 clouds in total across all five days."
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to know how many pods it has. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 

The regular box has 100 pods. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.20. 

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20

So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod. 

The cost of one pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12. 

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12
= 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

The final answer is 8."
"So, Thomas starts with $1000. He takes out 50 $20 bills, which is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills. Then, he loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is 14.5."
"So, the teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk and he tries to use only 20% of it each day. He used up 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 2.25 inches. Since he can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled it.

Now, he needs to find out how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be used up at a rate of 20% per day. Let's say the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day.

We can set up an equation: 0.20 * (2.25 - 0.45x) = 0.45

Simplifying the equation:

0.20 * 2.25 - 0.20 * 0.45x = 0.45

0.45 - 0.09x = 0.45

Subtracting 0.45 from both sides:

-0.09x = 0

Dividing both sides by -0.09:

x = 5

So, the teacher will have 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first find out how many girls and boys are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and 1/3 of them are on varsity. So, the number of girls on varsity is 1/3 * 12 = 4.

There are 12 boys in the class, and 1/4 of them are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class: 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to follow the steps.

First, we know Mike bought 5 face masks. Then, we need to multiply 5 by 3 to find out how many face masks Johnny bought thrice as many as Mike. 

3 * 5 = 15

Next, we add 2 to 15 to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. 

15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that. So, the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed (15) by the total number of teeth James has (30), and then multiply by 100.

15 ÷ 30 = 0.5
0.5 × 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got back, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk he bought.

He bought 4000 gallons of milk. 2/5 of that is 1600 gallons. Since the milk costs $3.50 per gallon, we multiply 1600 by $3.50 to find the total refund.

1600 * $3.50 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's use variables to represent the current ages of Wendy and Colin. Let W be Wendy's current age and C be Colin's current age.

From the first statement, we can write an equation: W = 5(C + 7)

This means Wendy's current age is 5 times the sum of Colin's current age and 7. We can simplify this to W = 5C + 35.

The second statement tells us that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as: C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute W = 5C + 35 into this equation to get: C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3: 3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, let's solve for C. We can subtract 3C from both sides: 75 = 2C + 35

Next, we subtract 35 from both sides: 40 = 2C

Finally, we divide both sides by 2: C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54

Since Bob has 3 schools, we need to divide 54 by 3.

54 ÷ 3 = 18

Since each set of 100 books costs $500, and Bob has 18 sets, we can multiply 18 by 100 to find out how many books each school can get.

18 × 100 = 1800

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Newton starts with 2 apples.
2. He puts 1 apple in his pocket and throws 1 apple into the tree, which causes 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He puts 6 apples in his pocket and throws 1 apple back into the tree, which causes 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brings home 13 apples.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends eat. Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so we add those together: 6 + 4 = 10 slices per friend.

Since there are 6 friends, we multiply 10 slices by 6: 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

6 cheese pizzas + 8 pepperoni pizzas = 14 pizzas

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Let's break it down:

- Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles
- Miles on Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles
- Total miles: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to think about how many snowballs he builds and how many melt in an hour.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 of them melt. So, in an hour, he actually builds 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

Now, we want to know how many hours it will take him to build 60 snowballs at this rate. To do that, we can divide 60 by 18.

60 ÷ 18 = 3.33

Since you can't have a fraction of an hour, we can round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Jay about 4 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The answer is 4."
"To find Jim's age, we need to divide John's age by 2 since John is twice as old as Jim. 

John is 28 years old now. If we divide 28 by 2, we get 14. So, Jim is 14 years old.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate:
Doxa: 1
Sister: 2
Brother: 3
Total slices eaten: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To figure out how many bandages the nurses started with, let's break it down step by step.

The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day and bought one pack of 50. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

On the third day, they bought two packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

The answer is 93."
"To find the cost of May's haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive in April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in April. So, we multiply the hours she works per day by the number of days she works in a week, and then by the number of weeks in April.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Jen gets paid $1.5 for each hour she works. So, we multiply the total hours she worked by her hourly rate.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Jen also gets $10 for every week she works. Since she works for 4 weeks, we multiply the number of weeks by her attendance bonus.

Total earnings from attendance = 4 weeks * $10/week = $40

To find Jen's total earnings, we add the earnings from her hourly rate and her attendance bonus.

Total earnings = $270 + $40 = $310

The final answer is: $310"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each activity and then add them together.

Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 x $0.50 = $3.00
He did his laundry once, so he earned $3.00
He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 x $0.75 = $1.50
He cleaned his room once, so he earned $1.50

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The total amount Jason earned is $8.00."
"To find out how much blood ten sharks have, we need to know how much blood a single shark has. We know that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we multiply 40 by 3 to find out how much blood a shark has.

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have.

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood."
"So, there are 50 people who entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people came in at 10:00. This makes the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Later, twice as many people as the first 40 came in. Twice 40 is 80, so now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, 3 times as many people as the first 40 came in. 3 times 40 is 120, so now we have 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

He also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since he has 25 red pens, he bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find out how much he pays for each bottle, we need to divide the total cost by the number of bottles. 

$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5.

$60 x 1.5 = $90 per bottle

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cognac. We multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:
20 x $90 = $1800

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

"So, there was a party in four days, and Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. But then some people drank some of it. 

First, 4 gallons were drunk by the kids. So, 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left. 

Then, 7 gallons were spilled by Barbie. So, 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.

Next, 5 gallons were drunk by Ronnie. So, 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.

Finally, 3 people drank the remaining root beer. So, 8 - 3 = 5 gallons were left.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people. There were 3 people, so 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher's lounge, we need to solve an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs is x.

The problem says ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. The equation is: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3. 

66 ÷ 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"So, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. That's a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors. In total, she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Then, her sister took one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy was left with 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

After that, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. There were 6 colors in that set, and half of 6 is 3. So, she used up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow some steps.

First, we find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second floor. Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the shells, we multiply 700 by 0.4.

700 * 0.4 = 280

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells. We subtract 280 from 700.

700 - 280 = 420

Next, we need to find out how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

"So, John wants to get a loan for his house. His house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that's 40% of that amount. To find 40% of $250,000, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000. That's $100,000.

Now, John uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, we multiply 0.6 by $100,000. That's $60,000.

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount. So, we subtract $60,000 from $100,000. That leaves us with $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas, we need to add up the weights of all three tunas. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Let's add them up: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

So, Deandre will earn $64 from selling all the tunas.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72

"So, Brian has a dehumidifier that has three speeds: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.

To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is 29."

"So, we have two schools. One is private and the other is public. The private school has a class with 120 students. The public school has two classes, and each class has 1/8 the number of students in the private school's class.

To find the number of students in each public school class, we need to divide 120 by 8. 

120 ÷ 8 = 15

Since the public school has two classes, we multiply 15 by 2.

15 * 2 = 30

So, the public school has 30 students in each class. To find the total capacity of the public school, we add the number of students in both classes.

30 + 30 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (private school) + 60 (public school) = 180.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first.

The interest is 2% of the money he borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months. 

$25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

$275 + $6 = $281

So, Stephen will pay $281 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to know how many diapers need to be changed in total. Since there are 2 kids and each kid needs 5 diaper changes per day, we multiply the number of kids by the number of diaper changes per kid.

2 kids * 5 diaper changes per kid = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. Half of 10 diaper changes is 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall, so we multiply these numbers together: 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 540 / 0.8 = 675.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

"To find the total number of people on the bus, let's break it down step by step.

The bus had 20 people initially. Then, 40 people got on at the first stop. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop got on the bus. 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 more people got on the bus. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of people on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus can hold 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"So, Pauline visits her favorite museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3.

For the first 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $2 = $10. For the next 3 years, the cost is 3 * $3 = $9. To find the total cost, we add these two amounts together: $10 + $9 = $19.

First, we need to find out how many groups can be made. Since there are 10 students in each grade and 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide 10 by 8. This gives us 1.25 groups. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can make 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, the 3 full groups will take 3 x 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The group with 2 students will also take 45 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time for the 3 full groups and the group with 2 students. 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to add the cost of the tables and the roof frames.

The cost of 4 tables is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

So, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100."
"So, Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's call the length of the shorter piece ""x"". Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the two pieces is 40. We can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds.

80 ÷ 16 = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much fabric Luke needs, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

There are 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. So, we multiply 5 by 35.

5 * 35 = 175

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply 175 by 2.

175 * 2 = 350

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find out how many inches of rain there will be on Tuesday, we need to do a simple math problem. 

First, we need to find out how much it rained on Monday. It rained 2 inches on Monday. 

Next, we need to find out how much it will rain on Tuesday. It's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total. Twice the amount of Monday's total is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cupcakes Carly made, we need to figure out the total number of treats she made. Since each person gets two treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.

Now, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes is 'x'. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of treats: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Karen will pay, we need to calculate the discount for getting both a manicure and a pedicure. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

There are 3 magazines that send 12 issues each, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

There's also 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many paintings Kim has. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. 

39 - 8 = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we increase the price by 80% in December. This means we add 80% of the original price to the original price. 80% of $40 is 0.8 * $40 = $32. So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Then, we decrease the price by 50% in January. This means we subtract 50% of the price in December from the price in December. 50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36. So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"So, Charlie is a tennis teacher. He charges $80 per hour for lessons, but he gives a discount to veterans. He teaches 4 regular lessons and 2 lessons to veterans. 

First, let's calculate how much he makes from the regular lessons. He teaches 4 lessons at $80 each, so that's 4 x $80 = $320.

For the lessons with veterans, he gets a discount of 25%. That means he charges $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He teaches 2 lessons to veterans, so that's 2 x $60 = $120.

To find the total amount of money Charlie makes, we add the money from the regular lessons and the money from the lessons with veterans. So, $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

Let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total score by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to figure out how many she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it by multiplying the original amount by 1/4.

Original amount = 20
Amount left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Now, we need to find out how many pomelos she gave away. We can do this by subtracting the amount left from the original amount.

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out how much money Walter got from selling the apples, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how many apples Walter ate. We know he ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To do this, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left. We subtract the apples he ate from the total number of apples.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. We know he gave her 25% of the remaining apples. To do this, we multiply 36 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%).

36 * 0.25 = 9

Now, we subtract the apples he gave to his sister from the remaining apples.

36 - 9 = 27

Finally, we need to find out how much money Walter got from selling the remaining apples. We know he sold them at $3 each. To do this, we multiply the number of apples he sold by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find out how many novels Regina wrote this year, we need to figure out what number, when divided by 4, gives us 9. Since 9 is 3 quarters of the number, we can multiply 9 by 4 to get the total.

So, 9 * 4 = 36

The answer is 36."
"To find out how much distance Michael covered, we need to multiply his speed by the number of hours he traveled. Since he's traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we need to figure out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used some for juice.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by the family to the grapes used by the mother. But we actually need to add the grapes used by the family to the total grapes used by the mother, so we add 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

There were 13 teachers who were sick, and 9 substitute teachers came in to help. 

So, the total number of teachers is 13 + 9 = 22."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients he buys each week.

Bud buys pasta for $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese. He also buys twice as much gruyere cheese as the cheddar cheese, so that's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 for the gruyere cheese. 

The total cost of the ingredients each week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to multiply the weekly cost by 52 weeks in a year. 

$10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00

The final answer is: $520"
"To find out how much time the custodian spends cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15 to get 1200 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 1200 by 60 to get 20 hours. 

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of the day they spend cleaning, we divide 20 hours by 8 hours and multiply by 100. This gives us 25%.

So, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to know how many books each shelf can hold. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, so it can hold 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the capacity of all the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Elly has 110 books, so we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves: 
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much money Rose will make, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. So, the total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price. 

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since there are 100 hats in total, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. We know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is 70 (from the first test) + 40 (from the second test) = 110 questions.

70% of 110 questions is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct.

Since Audrey already got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct.

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test. She needs 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how many blueberry cubes Mary made, we need to figure out how many strawberry cubes she made first. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

She plays 40 games every year and scores 21 points per game. We can multiply these two numbers together to get the total points she scores in one year. 

40 * 21 = 840

Since she has been playing for 4 years, we need to multiply the points she scores in one year by 4.

840 * 4 = 3360

So, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"So, Brendan had 10 marbles initially. He dropped half of them, which means he lost 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles. To find the total number of marbles he has now, we need to add the marbles he found to the ones he already had.

Let's do the math: 10 (initial marbles) - 5 (marbles dropped) = 5 marbles left. Then, he found 3 more, so 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Next, we need to find out how many potential customers Jason needs to get to get 15 customers. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers.

Now, we need to find out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers. Since for every 25 phone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls to get 30 potential customers.

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"So, there are 8 rooms in Brianna's house and 4 people living there. Each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights. Since there are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights, that's 8 x 2 = 16 more flashlights. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Now, let's talk about the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles. The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16. The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

To find the total number of candles, we add the small and medium candles together: 16 + 20 = 36.

"To figure out how long it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side.

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so they each take 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they each take 2.5 minutes.

Let's add them up: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

So, it takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"To find out how much water Crista needs for her plants, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

First, let's find out how much water the 4 plants that need half a cup of water need. We multiply 4 by 0.5, which is 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. We multiply 8 by 1, which is 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. We subtract the number of plants that need half a cup and 1 cup of water from the total number of plants. 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We multiply 8 by 0.25, which is 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas to get back home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the land distance and the water distance separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

The land distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.
The water distance is also 100 yards.

Time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
Time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Total time taken = 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants. She has 2 pairs, and each costs $8.00. So, 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the skirt. She has 1 skirt, and it costs $6.00.

To find the total cost, we add the costs of the blouses, pants, and skirt together: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

So, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to know how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

John's new speaking speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed. His original speed is 150 words per minute. So, his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"So, Conor goes to the beach every day and finds out how many people are there. On the first day, he sees 50 people. The next day, there are 20 more people than the day before, so he sees 50 + 20 = 70 people. 

On the third day, the number of people doubles from the second day, so he sees 70 * 2 = 140 people. 

For the rest of the week, Conor sees an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days left, he sees 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. Then, in the next 30 seconds, 3 times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is 210."
"To make lemonade for the party, Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 gallons.

First, we find out how many lemons are needed for 1 gallon:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Tim also wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart. This extra gallon will need half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

We add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of food each dog eats in a day and then add them together.

The German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 of them. So, 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of food for the German Shepherds per day.

The Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 of them. So, 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of food for the Bulldogs per day.

Now, let's add the food for both breeds together: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of dog food per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the daily amount by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms of dog food.

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

There are 10 2-legged animals, and each has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20 legs. 

There are 15 4-legged animals, and each has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from these animals is 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to figure out how many blocks are not blue or yellow. We know there are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, so we add those together: 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we subtract 12 from 32 to find the number of red blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"So, Elvis is driving west for 5 hours. We need to find out how far he traveled. To do that, we multiply the speed (18 miles per hour) by the time (5 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 * 5
Distance = 90 miles

Then, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours. We do the same thing: multiply the speed (18 miles per hour) by the time (8 hours).

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 * 8
Distance = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance Elvis traveled. We add the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east.

Total distance = 90 miles + 144 miles
Total distance = 234 miles

Since Elvis drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do that, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east.

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First, we find 30% of the original price of the boat, which is $9000. 30% of $9000 is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the boat depreciates by $2700 in the first year. The value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates another 30% of its value, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates 20% of its value, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to figure out how many orange and yellow candies there are. We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we multiply 54 by 2 to get the number of orange candies.

Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so we divide 54 by 2 to get the number of yellow candies.

Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, we can find 10% of that amount.

10% of $80 is 0.1 x $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

The final answer is: $136"
"So, Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. Dallas drops 4 marbles in the playground and ends up with 21. To find out how many marbles Darla got, we need to figure out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4.

Let's do that: 21 (the marbles Dallas has after dropping 4) + 4 (the marbles dropped) = 25. So, Dallas had 25 marbles initially.

Now, we know Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins. Since Dallas had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla got: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of the tickets is $12 per adult and $8 per child. There are 3 people in the family, so the total cost of the tickets is:
- 2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
- 1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

They also bought 2 popcorns for $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:
- 2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:
Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

The family pays a total of $38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds. The luggage weighs 250 pounds. The two children weigh 75 pounds each, so together they weigh 150 pounds.

The total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

1% of 1600 pounds is 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)

In James' case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, we have two people, Mia and Emma. Mia is younger than Emma, and Mia is 40 years old. We need to find out how old Emma is. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by each person and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. Let's add them together:

214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Now, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells, which is 67. 

732 - 67 = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find out how much Avery will spend on place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

First, we need to know how many dinner plates she needs. Since she's having 12 people over for dinner, and she's buying a 3-piece setting for each person, she'll need 12 * 3 = 36 dinner plates. Each dinner plate costs $6.00, so the total cost for dinner plates is 36 * $6.00 = $216.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the bowls. She's buying a 3-piece setting for each person, so she'll need 12 * 3 = 36 bowls. Each bowl costs $5.00, so the total cost for bowls is 36 * $5.00 = $180.00.

Lastly, we need to calculate the cost of the salad plates. She's buying a 3-piece setting for each person, so she'll need 12 * 3 = 36 salad plates. Each salad plate costs $4.00, so the total cost for salad plates is 36 * $4.00 = $144.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $216.00 + $180.00 + $144.00 = $540.00

Avery will spend $540.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to figure out half of Steve's time first. Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle.

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Then, we add 2 hours to this half to find Anna's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day.

There are 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, we multiply 5 pigs by 4 pounds and then by 2.

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To figure out how many hot dogs John needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

John already has 4 hot dogs, so we need to subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack has 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so her income from cupcakes is 20 * 2 = $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so her income from cookies is 40 * 1 = $40. Her total income is $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys 5 trays of cupcakes for $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 * 4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income: $80 - $20 = $60.

The answer is $60."
"To find out how many children are following the ice cream truck, let's break it down step by step.

First, we start with 5 children. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so we add 5 more children. Now, we have 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. To find the total number of children, we multiply 10 by 2 and add the result to 10. This gives us 10 + 20 = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. To find the final number of children following the truck, we subtract 5 from 30. This gives us 30 - 5 = 25 children.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals.

Let's do the math:

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, let's subtract the meals given out from the total meals:

Meals left = Total meals - Meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To find out how much money James has, we need to add up the value of each coin.

A quarter is worth 25 cents. Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents. Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

So, James has 105 cents."
"So, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in a family. All the sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the older brother. We need to find the age of the older brother.

Since 12 is half of the older brother's age, we can multiply 12 by 2 to find the older brother's age.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16.

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"So, Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day. That's a total of 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes per week.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week. That's 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week. Since there are 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 5 hours * 4 weeks = 20 hours.

Now, let's add the time she spends on meditation and yoga. We need to convert the meditation time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 210 minutes is 210 / 60 = 3.5 hours.

Adding the meditation and yoga time together, we get 3.5 hours + 20 hours = 23.5 hours.

The final answer is: 23.5"
"To find the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we need to calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of the small shirts. There are 11 small shirts, and each one is 3 square feet. So, the total area of the small shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the medium shirts. There are 8 medium shirts, and each one is 4 square feet. So, the total area of the medium shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the area of the large shirts. There are 6 large shirts, and each one is 6 square feet. So, the total area of the large shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

To find the total area of the quilt, we need to add the areas of all the shirts together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to figure out how many pens Timothy has first. We know that Timothy has three times as many pens as George. Since George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To find Jackie's height before the summer, we need to know how tall she is now. We know she's 2"" shorter than Anne, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. Albert is 36"" tall, so Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"".

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, we subtract 2"" from Anne's height: 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Now, we know Jackie's height after the summer is 70"". To find her height before the summer, we need to subtract the amount she grew, which is 3"". So, we subtract 3"" from 70"": 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The answer is 67""."
"To find out how much money the company will get from selling the chocolate bars, we need to know how many bars they make in two weeks. Since they make 5000 bars in one day, we multiply that by 14 days.

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The price of each bar is $2. So, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The company will receive $140,000 for selling the chocolate bars in two weeks."
"So, Jake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40.

To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16.
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4.
- So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4.
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16.
- The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from doing his chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we can divide $13 by $6.50 to find out how many tickets he can buy:
13 / 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and her sister spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount she spent is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. The total amount she spent on the bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, the total amount she spent is $30 + $200 = $230.

To find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add their individual totals: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To make one jar of the special honey and jam mix, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey. The prices of these ingredients are $6 per pound for passion fruit, $8 per pound for jackfruit, and $10 per pound for honey.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one jar:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

Let's start by finding the value of the quarters. There are 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have the dimes. There are 95 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Now, let's look at the nickels. There are 120 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. So, 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Lastly, we have the pennies. There are 750 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for movie tickets for herself, $7.50 for movie tickets for her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Let's add these amounts together:

$3.50 + $7.50 = $11
$11 + $7.50 = $18.50
$18.50 + $8.50 = $27

Janet's parents gave her $40.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"So, Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He's open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. That means he's open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he's open 5 * 2 = 10 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 * 10 = 30 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 30 cars, he makes 30 * 4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:

- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:

- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:

- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:

- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we add the number of each type of cookie together: 6 + 7 + 6 = 19.

The final answer is 19."
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 7 = $42

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many holes the dog dug in total. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so we multiply 6 holes by 14 days to get the total number of holes dug.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To fill 84 holes, it will take 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, there are 4000 students at Norman High School. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. To find out how many students are at Butler High School, we need to multiply 4000 by 3/4.

3/4 is the same as 0.75. So, we multiply 4000 by 0.75.

4000 * 0.75 = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of students at Norman High School and Butler High School. To do this, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, there are 1000 more students at Norman High School than at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Let's do the math:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies, then subtract that from the total number of cookies.

First, add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract 5670 from the total number of cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested. Since he was supposed to get 16 test tubes, he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He also gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. Since he was supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, he got 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The number of beakers he had is 7, but he lost some. Let's say he lost x beakers. So, the correct number of beakers is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor had on the lab bench is 29. We can set up an equation: 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29 (total items). But we know he lost some beakers, so we need to subtract the correct number of beakers from the total number of beakers he should have had.

Let's set up the equation: 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 31 - x = 29.

Solving for x, we get: x = 2.

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much money they all raised, we need to add up the amounts each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find Vanessa's speed by dividing Aaron's speed by 2.

Aaron's speed = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

Now, we know Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. So, if Aaron ran 2 miles, Vanessa ran 4 miles. To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we multiply her speed by the distance.

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 miles * 8 minutes per mile
Time = 32 minutes

The final answer is 32."
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 x 3 = 600

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To figure out how much money Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to do a little math.

First, we need to know how much they make in a day. They get 6 reservations, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The meals cost $5 each, and the wine is $5. So, the meals cost 6 * 2 * $5 = $60. Adding the $5 wine, that's $60 + $5 = $65 per day.

Now, we need to know how many days they are open in a week. They are open 2 days a week. So, we multiply the daily amount by 2. $65 * 2 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. We can find the cost per watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we'll find 25% of the cost and add it to the cost.

25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60
25% of $1.60 = $0.40

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price = $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to figure out the current age of his youngest son.

We know that Dora is 9 years old now, and James is twice as old as Dora. So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

We also know that James was born when John was 19 years old. So, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. They start peeling oranges at the same time.

In the first minute, they both peel 1 orange each. In the second minute, Ana peels 1 orange and Jane peels 1 orange. In the third minute, Ana peels 1 orange and Jane peels 1 orange, and so on.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, they will peel the same number of oranges in each minute. This means that after 1 minute, they have peeled 2 oranges each.

After 2 minutes, they will have peeled 4 oranges each.

After 3 minutes, they will have peeled 6 oranges each.

Notice a pattern? They are peeling 2 more oranges each minute than the previous minute.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply the number of oranges they peel in the first minute (2) by 59 (since they have already peeled 2 oranges in the first minute).

2 * 59 = 118

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 118 oranges.

This is an arithmetic series with a first term of 2, a last term of 118, and 59 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (59/2) * (2 + 118)
Sum = 29.5 * 120
Sum = 3540

Jane will have peeled 59 oranges in the first minute, 59 oranges in the second minute, and so on.

The sum of the number of oranges Jane peels in 59 minutes is:

59 + 59 + 59 + ... + 59
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of 59, a last term of 59, and 59 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (59/2) * (59 + 59)
Sum = 29.5 * 118
Sum = 3497

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:

3540 - 3497 = 43

So, Ana will peel 43 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

Final Answer: 43"
"So, Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. The original price is $400, but he buys it at a junk shop for 80% off. That means he pays 20% of the original price.

20% of $400 is 0.2 * $400 = $80. So, the radiator costs $80.

Then, Mark hires a mechanic to install it. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

In total, Mark paid $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is $230."
"To solve this problem, we need to think about how many legs each animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The number of cows is 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices."
