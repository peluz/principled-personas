"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and utilizes for baking.

Janet's daily egg production is 16. After consuming 3 eggs for breakfast, she is left with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. Subsequently, she uses 4 eggs for baking, resulting in 13 - 4 = 9 eggs available for sale.

Given that each egg is sold for $2, the total daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Therefore, Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market are $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we must first establish the amount of each fiber type needed. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. It is also mentioned that the amount of white fiber required is half that of the blue fiber.

Let's calculate the amount of white fiber needed: 2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt (white)

Now, we can find the total number of bolts required by adding the amounts of blue and white fiber: 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit made by Josh, we first need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. This can be calculated by multiplying the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase).

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
New value = $200,000

The profit is then found by subtracting the original price from the new value.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we are dealing with a multiplication operation, where the number of sprints per week (3) is multiplied by the distance covered per sprint (60 meters).

The resulting product of this multiplication operation yields the total distance covered by James in a week. 

The calculation can be represented as: 3 * 60 = 180

Therefore, James runs a total of 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed requirement for her flock. Given that each chicken receives three cups of feed per day and there are 20 chickens in the flock, the total daily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, we can find the amount needed for the final meal by subtracting this from the total daily requirement.

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already provided
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5. 

For the remaining 15 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each glass, which is 60% of the original price. This can be expressed as 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.

The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is then 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

Given that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can express this relationship as C = 4S. Additionally, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which can be represented as T = 2C.

We are also provided with the information that Seattle has 20 sheep, so S = 20.

Substituting S = 20 into the equation C = 4S, we find that C = 4 * 20 = 80.

Substituting C = 80 into the equation T = 2C, we find that T = 2 * 80 = 160.

Now, to determine the total number of sheep in all three cities, we can add the number of sheep in each city: T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To determine the total time required to download the file, we can break down the process into two distinct phases: the initial download and the subsequent restart.

During the initial download, Carla downloads 80% of the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. This can be calculated as:

Time = Total data / Download rate
Time = 0.8 * 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, the download is interrupted after 80% completion, and a 20-minute restart is required. After the restart, the remaining 20% of the file (0.2 * 200 GB = 40 GB) is downloaded at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. This can be calculated as:

Time = Total data / Download rate
Time = 40 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 20 minutes

The total time required to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the initial download and the time taken for the second download:

Total time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John covers during the initial 3 hours of driving at a constant speed of 60 mph. This can be found using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Substituting the given values, we get:

Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Next, John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, during which he does not move. Therefore, the distance covered during this period is 0 miles.

After the standstill, John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance covered during this period:

Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph. Again, applying the formula:

Distance = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

To find the total distance John has traveled, we sum the distances covered in each segment:

Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled to find the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours:

Distance from home = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine Eliza's total earnings for the week, we must consider her regular hourly rate and overtime pay. 

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours, which is a straightforward application of the hourly rate. 

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 45 hours in total, the number of overtime hours is 5. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. 

5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we sum her earnings for the regular and overtime hours to obtain her total earnings for the week.

$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we calculate the number of downloads for each month. The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which equals 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

For the third month, the downloads were 30% less than the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, resulting in 54 downloads. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{294}$"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of each item and subsequently summing them up.

The cost of the donuts can be obtained by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen, yielding 3 * $68 = $204. 

Similarly, the cost of the mini cupcakes is found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen, resulting in 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is determined by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen, giving 6 * $55 = $330.

By adding these individual costs together, we arrive at the total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. The initial investment required to plant the tree is $90. Each year, the tree generates a net profit of $7.50, as calculated by subtracting the annual expenses of $3 from the annual income of $10.50.

To find the number of years it takes for the tree to break even, we can divide the initial investment by the annual net profit. This yields:

$90 (initial investment) / $7.50 (annual net profit) = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the lemon tree to start generating a profit.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie sold at the green house as x and the number she sold at the orange house as y.

We know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so the number of vacuum cleaners she had left after selling at the green house is 2/3 of the initial amount. We can express this as:

(2/3) * Total = x + 2

We also know that she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which can be represented as:

(1/2) * (2/3 * Total - x - 2) = y

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

(2/3 * Total - x - 2) - y = 5

Now, we can solve the system of equations. First, let's express y in terms of x:

y = (1/2) * (2/3 * Total - x - 2)

Substituting this expression for y into the previous equation, we get:

(2/3 * Total - x - 2) - (1/2) * (2/3 * Total - x - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(2/3 * Total - x - 2) - (1/3 * Total - x/2 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms:

(1/3 * Total - 3/2) = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions:

2 * Total - 9 = 30

Add 9 to both sides:

2 * Total = 39

Divide both sides by 2:

Total = 39/2

Total = 19.5

Since the number of vacuum cleaners cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the correct answer is not an integer, which indicates that the initial assumption that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house is incorrect. 

The correct approach would be to re-evaluate the problem and consider the possibility that Melanie sold a different fraction of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

(2/3) * Total - 2 = 5

Add 2 to both sides:

(2/3) * Total = 7

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total = 21/2

Total = 10.5

Again, the correct answer is not an integer, which indicates that the initial assumption is still incorrect.

"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we must first calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 20% of the total, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of the remaining students, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is then 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the optimal choice, we can model the potential profit for each option using the concept of compound interest. Let's calculate the potential value of each investment.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5% per month
Number of months: 1
Potential value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2% per month
Number of months: 1
Potential value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train, we can utilize the concept of vector addition. Since the trains travel in two different directions, we must consider both the horizontal and vertical components of their displacement.

Let's denote the initial displacement of each train as a vector with components (80, 0), representing 80 miles traveled westward. On the second day, the trains travel 150 miles northward, which can be represented by the vector (0, 150).

To find the resultant displacement, we add the two vectors component-wise:

(80, 0) + (0, 150) = (80, 150)

The magnitude of the resultant vector represents the total distance covered by each train. We can calculate this using the Pythagorean theorem:

√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √28900 ≈ 170.83 miles

Therefore, each train covers approximately 170.83 miles in the two days.

The final answer is: 170.83"
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we must first calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then sum them.

Let's begin by calculating her weekly earnings from teaching. We know that Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher and earns $20 per hour. Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since Jill works 50 weeks per year, her annual earnings from teaching can be calculated as:

Annual earnings from teaching = $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, we'll calculate her weekly earnings from coaching. Jill works 15 hours per week as a coach and earns $30 per hour. Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from coaching by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works per year:

Annual earnings from coaching = $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Finally, we can determine Jill's total annual salary by adding her annual earnings from teaching and coaching:

Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we establish the daily egg consumption, which is 3 eggs. Multiplying this by the number of days in a week (7) yields a weekly egg consumption of 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.

Next, we multiply the weekly egg consumption by the number of weeks (4) to obtain the total egg consumption over the specified period: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen: 84 / 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire consumes 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time Marissa has spent so far. Given that she walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in 1 hour, the total time spent is 2 hours.

Since Marissa aims to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time required to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

As Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain the desired average speed.

The remaining distance is 12 - (4 + 2) = 6 miles. To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we first need to calculate the amount of water in each drink before and after the spill.

The orange drink is composed of 2/3 water, so the initial amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the initial amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

When the 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the orange drink is 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. The amount of water in the pineapple drink remains 9 liters. The total amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters, and the amount of water in this remaining orange drink is 17/3 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the pineapple drink and the water in the remaining orange drink: 9 + 17/3 = 9 + 5.67 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the difference between his current age and the age at which he had his son.

Given that Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can deduce that Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since his son's birth by subtracting his age at the time of birth from his current age:

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age at son's birth) = 2 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then summing these values.

First, we consider the first 3 customers, who each purchased one DVD. This yields a total of 3 DVDs. Next, we examine the subsequent 2 customers, who each acquired 2 DVDs, resulting in a total of 4 DVDs. Lastly, the final 3 customers made no purchases, contributing 0 DVDs to the total.

By adding these values together, we arrive at a total of 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total length of time the candle burns, we first need to calculate the duration between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. This can be achieved by subtracting the start time from the end time, resulting in a 4-hour period.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length of the candle that melts during this time by multiplying the duration by the melting rate:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the original price of the book, we can utilize the concept of percentage decrease. The discounted price is $19.50, and it represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

75% of x = $19.50
0.75x = $19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we must first calculate the total cost of the items other than pizza. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. 

First, we calculate the total cost of each type of clothing item: 
- 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each: 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
- 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each: 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
- 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each: 3 * $42 = $126

Next, we sum the individual costs to obtain the total expenditure: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items.

$243"
"To determine the total cost of ice cream over a 60-day period, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream per night, resulting in a total of 60 servings in 60 days. Given that each carton contains 15 servings, we can calculate the number of cartons required as follows:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream over the 60-day period.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we must first calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles, and Henry stopped after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can calculate the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop as 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

40 - 45 = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we must re-evaluate the problem. Let's rephrase the question: Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the trip, not from the first stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 40 miles, and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 15 miles. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we can add these two distances:

40 + 15 = 55 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 55 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the boots as 'b' and the cost of the first pair of heels as 'h1', and the cost of the second pair of heels as 'h2'. We are given that h1 = $33 and h2 = 2 * h1 = $66.

We also know that the total cost of the boots and the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

b = h1 + h2 + 5

Substituting the values of h1 and h2, we get:

b = $33 + $66 + 5
b = $104

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, as their ages are in the ratio of 7:11.

The total of their ages is given as 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18, yielding x = 162 / 18 = 9.

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine their current ages. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To determine the average guess, we must first calculate the number of jelly beans in each person's estimate. 

The first person's estimate is 80 jelly beans. 

The second person's estimate is 20 more than half of the first person's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person's estimate is 25% more than the first person's estimate. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following estimates: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

Therefore, the average guess is 80."
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the daily care time to obtain the total daily care hours.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can then multiply the daily hours by 7 to calculate the total weekly care hours.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs."
"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

Given that the total number of coins is 110, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins, we can easily find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R. We are given that R = 40.

We are also given that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, which can be expressed as S = A - 2.

Additionally, we know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. This can be represented as A = (R/2) + 5.

Substituting the value of R into the equation A = (R/2) + 5, we get A = (40/2) + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the value of S by substituting A into the equation S = A - 2. Therefore, S = 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we can break down his performance into two segments: the first 20 minutes and the subsequent 20 minutes.

In the initial 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 

For the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes. This can be found by multiplying the points scored in the first 20 minutes by 0.25, which yields 4 * 0.25 = 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

The total points scored by Mike can be obtained by summing the points scored in both segments: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine Terry's total expenditure on yogurts over a 30-day period, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the total number of yogurts consumed within the given timeframe. Given that Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day, we can calculate this as follows:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we need to determine the cost of a single yogurt. The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so we can calculate the cost of one yogurt by dividing the total cost by the quantity:

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we can calculate Terry's total expenditure by multiplying the total number of yogurts consumed by the cost of one yogurt:

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75

Therefore, Terry's total expenditure on yogurts over 30 days is $75.

Final answer: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Let's denote the initial number of Lego sets John had as x. Since he sold each set for $15, the total amount he received from selling his Lego sets is 15x.

We know that he spent $20 on 8 video games, which amounts to a total expenditure of 8 * 20 = $160. Additionally, he had $5 left after this purchase. Therefore, the total amount he had initially can be expressed as 15x = 160 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get 15x = 165.

To find the initial number of Lego sets, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15, yielding x = 165 / 15 = 11.

However, this represents the number of Lego sets he initially had. Since he sold all his Lego sets, the number of Lego sets he still has is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine John's running speed, we must first calculate the total time he spends running in a week. Given that he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time = 6 hours

Next, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance he runs in a week by the total time:

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we must first establish her running and walking speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and this is half of her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which equals 6 miles per hour.

Furthermore, since Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4, yielding 1.5 miles per hour.

With the established speeds, we can now calculate the time spent running and walking. Dana spends one-third of the time running, which equates to 2 hours, and two-thirds of the time walking, which equates to 4 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance traveled during each activity. The distance traveled while running is the product of her running speed and the time spent running, which is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. Similarly, the distance traveled while walking is the product of her walking speed and the time spent walking, which is 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, we can determine the total distance traveled by summing the distances traveled while running and walking, resulting in 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can establish a relationship between the ages of the iPhones based on the given information. Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as D.

Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we have S = 1.

It is also stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S. Substituting S = 1, we get B = 2 * 1 = 2.

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B. Substituting B = 2, we get D = 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to consider the relationship between the distance she can throw the javelin with and without the gemstone.

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance with the gemstone is 3x. We are given that this distance is 1200 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x = 1200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 1200 / 3
x = 400

Now that we know the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone (x = 400), we can find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames by subtracting the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone (3x = 1200):

Distance = 3x - 1000
= 1200 - 1000
= 200

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. After the guests took their pieces, 14 pieces remained. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

T - P = 14

Substituting the value of T, we get:

40 - P = 14

Solving for P, we find:

P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the amount of chips that can be consumed within the remaining daily calorie allowance, we first need to calculate the remaining calories available. 

Given that the daily calorie target is 2000 and 1800 calories have already been consumed, the remaining calories are:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings that can be consumed with the remaining calories as follows:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

As each serving corresponds to 100g of chips, the total amount of chips that can be consumed is:

0.8 servings * 100g per serving = 80g

Therefore, the individual can consume 80g of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is obtained by multiplying the number of candles sold by the selling price per candle. In this case, Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, resulting in:

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and he used 1 pound, the cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00. However, we must also account for the cost of the wick, which is $1.00 per candle. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = 10 candles * $1.00 per candle
Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the number of articles written on each day. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Given that each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total time spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This can be expressed as 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Consequently, the total time spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. The total time spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days, we sum the individual times: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. We know that Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work, resulting in 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of notes she had initially is 80 + x.

Since she used 220 notes at work, the equation representing the situation can be written as:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation yields:

x = 163

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of blue ties and the cost of a red tie.

Given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Therefore, the cost of a red tie can be calculated as:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of Cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

The total amount spent on red ties is:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we must first convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to obtain the number of pieces. This can be calculated as 48 ÷ 6 = 8.

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of unoccupied units in the building, we must first calculate the total number of units. Given that the building has 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units can be found by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Number of occupied units = 3/4 * Total units
Number of occupied units = 3/4 * 120
Number of occupied units = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Number of unoccupied units = Total units - Number of occupied units
Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we must first calculate the total number of eggs produced and sold within a week. Given that his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can calculate the weekly production as follows:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are typically sold in dozens, we must convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Finally, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we must first calculate the distance he covers during his outbound journey. Given that he sails from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the duration of this leg is 3 hours. 

The distance covered during this period can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for Tom to return, we can utilize the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to return.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can approach the problem by first calculating the total weight of the comic books he is removing. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books can be calculated as follows:

Weight of comic books = Number of comic books * Weight per comic book
Weight of comic books = 30 * (1/4)
Weight of comic books = 30 * 0.25
Weight of comic books = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

Remaining weight = Total weight to be removed - Weight of comic books removed
Remaining weight = 15 - 7.5
Remaining weight = 7.5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the number of toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of a toy, which is 1/2 pound.

Number of toys to remove = Remaining weight / Weight per toy
Number of toys to remove = 7.5 / 0.5
Number of toys to remove = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total earnings from truck and car tires separately for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires can be calculated as 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Thus, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it indicates that the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. Since Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying Trixie's kittens by 3. This yields 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Next, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. Therefore, the total number of kittens is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we must first calculate the number of lollipops remaining after she consumes 2. This can be achieved by subtracting 2 from the initial quantity of 30 lollipops.

30 - 2 = 28

Next, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to determine the number of bags that can be filled. This is a straightforward division operation.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we must first calculate the available weight for the boxes. This can be achieved by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Let's denote the weight of the bridge as B, the weight of the driver and the empty truck as D, and the weight of a single box as W. We are given the following values:

B = 5000 pounds
D = 3755 pounds
W = 15 pounds

The available weight for the boxes is then B - D, which equals 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the available weight by the weight of a single box: (B - D) / W = 1245 / 15.

Performing the division, we get 1245 / 15 = 83.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must first calculate the total amount of the extra fees. The 25% fee is equivalent to 0.25 times the original bill, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees consist of the 25% fee and the delivery fees, totaling $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Adding the total extra fees to the original bill yields $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the result, resulting in a final price of $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we must consider the two distinct components: the clusters and the individual raspberries.

Let's begin by calculating the total number of raspberries in the clusters. We are given that there are 6 clusters, each containing 20 raspberries. To find the total number of raspberries in the clusters, we can multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster:

6 clusters * 20 raspberries/cluster = 120 raspberries

In addition to the raspberries in the clusters, we are also informed that there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. To find the total number of raspberries, we can add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

The final answer is: $\boxed{187}$"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we must first identify the total number of oranges that are not good. This can be achieved by adding the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Let's begin by calculating the number of unripe oranges. Given that 20% of the total oranges are unripe, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Next, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe oranges:

1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:

25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we can break down her pension into two components: the initial 20-year period and the subsequent 10-year period.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is a fixed amount of $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, we can calculate the total amount she paid as:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid, we first calculate 10% of the original amount:
$140 * 0.1 = $14

Then, we subtract this amount from the original amount to find the reduced amount:
$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, we multiply the reduced amount by 6:
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can employ a straightforward approach by dividing the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up. 

Given that the tank's capacity is 12 gallons and she used 4 gallons to fill it, we can calculate the remaining capacity as follows:

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Next, we can utilize the fact that Sophia has already traveled 100 miles. To find the miles per gallon, we can set up a proportion:

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 8 gallons

Cross-multiplying yields:

100 * 8 = 4x
800 = 4x
x = 800 / 4
x = 200

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we must first calculate the daily hours spent on these activities. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which equates to 1 hour. Therefore, the total daily hours spent on TV and reading is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since Jim repeats this pattern 3 times a week, the weekly hours spent on TV and reading can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"

"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We are given that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we can express this relationship as R = D - 35.

Additionally, the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, which can be represented as E = 2R.

We are also given that there are 175 diamonds. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get R = 175 - 35 = 140.

Now, we can find the number of emeralds by substituting the value of R into the second equation: E = 2(140) = 280.

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of each type of gemstone: D + R + E = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we must first establish the total number of students. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. This yields 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

The total number of students is then the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. This results in 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for 'x', we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. 

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, and thus her weekly earnings can be calculated as 495 * $15 = $7425.

"To determine the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as a geometric sequence: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

Since there are 4 levels, the average square footage is the sum of the series divided by the number of terms:

Average = S / n
Average = 30 / 4
Average = 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used during this period is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the initial 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and it will require 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining days is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is the sum of the dog food used during the initial 180 days and the remaining days, which is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

To find the number of bags of dog food used in the first year, we divide the total amount of dog food used by the amount of dog food in one bag, which is 110 cups. Therefore, the number of bags used is 910 / 110 = 8.27. Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number, resulting in 9 bags.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can first establish the relative laundry loads of each individual. 

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much as David, we can calculate David's laundry load as follows:

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate his laundry load as follows:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David can be found by subtracting David's laundry load from Raymond's:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we must evaluate the total cost of each option.

Option 1: Purchasing in packages of 3 for $2.50
The number of packages required can be calculated as 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. Therefore, the total cost for this option is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

Option 2: Purchasing in packages of 2 for $1
The number of packages required can be calculated as 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. Therefore, the total cost for this option is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, purchasing in packages of 2 for $1 is the more cost-effective option.

The amount of money saved by choosing the better option is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The discount offered is 30% of the original cost. 

First, we calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original cost by the discount percentage (as a decimal). The original cost is $100, and the discount percentage is 30%, which is equivalent to 0.3 as a decimal.

Discount = Original cost * Discount percentage
= $100 * 0.3
= $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water initially allocated to the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

Let's denote the total amount of water as W. The amount of water each girl received is W/6. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is 2 * (W/6) = W/3.

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy received to this amount:
W/3 + 6

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total amount of water given from the initial amount:
W - (W/3 + 6)

We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:
W - W/3 - 6
= (3W - W)/3 - 6
= 2W/3 - 6

Since we know the initial amount of water is 24 liters, we can substitute W = 24:
(2 * 24)/3 - 6
= 48/3 - 6
= 16 - 6
= 10

Therefore, there were 10 liters of water left.

The final answer is 10."

"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can start by calculating Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, we can find the combined weight by adding Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"

First, we establish the number of rose bushes as the base unit, denoted as 'b'. Given that each rose bush has 25 roses, we can express the total number of roses as 25b. 

Next, we are informed that each rose possesses 8 thorns. Consequently, the total number of thorns can be calculated by multiplying the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose, yielding 8 * 25b = 200b.

In this scenario, 'b' represents the number of rose bushes, which is given as 3. Substituting this value into our equation, we obtain 200 * 3 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To determine the number of games won by the football team, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

The total number of games played is given as 22, which implies that the sum of the number of games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides yields:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 7

Therefore, the number of games lost is 7. Consequently, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Gene has one shirt from each vacation and he has been vacationing for 11 years, we can calculate the total number of blocks by multiplying the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of shirts he receives per year.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) can be calculated as follows:

Total number of blocks = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
Total number of blocks = 11 years * 4 vacations/year
Total number of blocks = 44

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

Final answer: 44"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can analyze the given information. The alarm's duration for each ring is described in terms of its relationship to the previous ring. 

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as 'x'. According to the problem, the second ring lasted three times as long as the first, so its duration is 3x. The third ring, on the other hand, was half as long as the second, making its duration 1.5x.

We know that the first ring lasted for 4 times, so we can set up the equation x = 4 to find the duration of the first ring. 

Now, we can calculate the total duration of all three rings: 
- The first ring lasted for 4 times.
- The second ring lasted for 3x = 3 * 4 = 12 times.
- The third ring lasted for 1.5x = 1.5 * 4 = 6 times.

The total duration of all three rings is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can utilize the concept of compound interest. 

The initial salary is $600, and it increases by 10% every year. We can express this as an exponential function: 

Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.1)^n, where n represents the number of years.

For the first three years, we can calculate the salary as follows:

Year 1: Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.1)^1 = 600 * 1.1 = $660
Year 2: Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.1)^2 = 600 * 1.21 = $726.60
Year 3: Salary = 600 * (1 + 0.1)^3 = 600 * 1.331 = $798.60

Given that an adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child consumes half as much, or 5 pounds, we can calculate the total amount needed as follows:

First, we calculate the total consumption of the adult dinosaurs: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total consumption of the child dinosaurs: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

Finally, we sum the total consumption of both groups to obtain the overall amount of potato salad required: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex should bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, the number of pets Marcia has can be expressed as x + 2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so the number of pets Jan has can be represented as 3(x + 2).

We are given that Cindy has four pets, so x = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pets, we get:

- Marcia's pets: 4 + 2 = 6
- Jan's pets: 3(4 + 2) = 3(6) = 18

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can utilize the given information about the age differences between the children. 

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We are given the following relationships:

1. M = C - 1
2. A = C - 2
3. A = J + 5

We can start by substituting the expression for M from equation (1) into equation (2) to find the age of Corey:

C - 1 = A - 2
C - 1 = (C - 2) - 2
C - 1 = C - 4
1 = 4

This equation is inconsistent, indicating an error in the initial setup. Let's re-evaluate the relationships.

Given that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, we can correctly express Corey's age as:

C = M + 1
C = 10 + 1
C = 11

Now that we have Corey's age, we can find Amy's age using the relationship A = C - 2:

A = 11 - 2
A = 9

Lastly, we can determine Jackson's age using the relationship A = J + 5:

9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles, we can start by establishing the relationship between Lee's and Gerald's original times. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Lee's time as x + 2.

We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides to obtain:

x = 36

This indicates that Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

To calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improvement, we need to find 10% of his original time and add it to his original time. The 10% increase can be calculated as 0.1 * 36 = 3.6.

Adding this increase to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39.6}$"
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We are given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which can be expressed as:

R = D + C - 12

Additionally, we know that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write:

C = 2D

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

R = D + 2D - 12
R = 3D - 12

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

R = 3(60) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets, we can add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Let's calculate the number of girls: 
Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate this as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we can calculate the fraction of hours James slept as a proportion of Harry's sleep. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can express this as a fraction of Harry's total sleep.

Let's denote Harry's sleep as H and James' sleep as J. We know that J = (2/3)H.

We are given that H = 9 hours. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

J = (2/3) * 9
J = 6 hours

To find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we subtract James' sleep from Harry's sleep:

H - J = 9 - 6
H - J = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we must first account for the volume loss during the canning process. Since the sauce retains half of the original volume, the 32 ounces of sauce represent half of the total volume of the tomatoes used. 

Let's denote the total volume of tomatoes as 'x'. Since the sauce retains half of the volume, we can express this as:

32 = (1/2)x

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 32 * 2
x = 64 ounces

Now, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes used, we can divide the total volume of tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces) and then multiply by the number of tomatoes per can (3):

Number of cans = 64 / 16 = 4
Total tomatoes = 4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We are given that 5 cars took an exit and 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

This indicates that 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we must first calculate the total number of potted plants she currently possesses. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of potted plants per window ledge (2) by the total number of window ledges (40).

Total potted plants = 2 * 40 = 80

Next, we must account for the 18 new potted plants Mary received from her favorite plant nursery. This can be done by adding the number of new plants to the total number of existing plants.

Total potted plants = 80 + 18 = 98

Finally, we must subtract the number of potted plants Mary plans to give away (1 per window ledge, which is 40) from the total number of potted plants she currently possesses.

Total potted plants remaining = 98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is 58."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we can analyze the information provided. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as x. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which can be expressed as (1 + 1/4)x = (5/4)x.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, who pressed the doorbell 60 times. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of doorbell rings:

x + (5/4)x + 70 + 60 = total number of doorbell rings

Combine like terms:

(9/4)x + 130 = total number of doorbell rings

Since we are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of doorbell rings:

(9/4)x + 130 = 60 + 70

Combine the constants on the right-hand side:

(9/4)x + 130 = 130

Subtract 130 from both sides:

(9/4)x = 0

Multiply both sides by 4/9:

x = 0

However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-examine the equation:

"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has left to read. This can be found by subtracting the number of pages he has already read from the total number of pages in all his textbooks.

Total pages in all textbooks = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Pages left to read = Total pages - Pages already read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we can find the average number of pages he needs to read per day by dividing the total pages left by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Total pages left / Number of days = 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we establish the number of glasses consumed on weekdays, which is 5 days (Monday to Friday) multiplied by 1 glass per day, resulting in 5 glasses. 

Next, we consider the weekend days. On Saturdays, John consumes 1 glass of water, while on Sundays, he consumes 0 glasses due to his preference for soda with dinner. 

The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of the glasses consumed on weekdays and the glass consumed on Saturday, which equals 5 + 1 = 6 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. The city's width is 42 miles, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

We can calculate the total time required by dividing the city's width by the rate at which it is covered. This yields:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, it will take 14 sets of these 10-minute intervals to cover the entire city. Therefore, the total time required is 14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces. This can be expressed as 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of pieces placed by Poppy from the total to find the remaining pieces: 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom, which is a third of the remaining pieces. This can be expressed as 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Finally, we subtract the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces to find the number of pieces left: 750 - 250 = 500.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is 500."
"To determine the total number of cookies consumed by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that Cody consumes three times the amount of cookies as Amir, and Amir's cookie consumption is 5, we can calculate Cody's consumption by multiplying Amir's amount by 3. This yields Cody's consumption as 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Subsequently, we can calculate the combined total by adding Amir's and Cody's individual consumptions: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box by subtracting the wall thickness from the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the wall thickness is 1 inch. Therefore, the inner dimensions are:

Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

Volume = Length x Width x Height
= 3 x 4 x 2
= 24 cubic inches

Since there are three identical boxes, the total inner volume is:

Total Volume = 24 x 3
= 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time spent watching TV on the other days. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, resulting in a total of 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, totaling 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, adding another 2 hours to the total.

The combined time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching on Wednesday can be calculated as 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60, resulting in 90 minutes.

To find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes, yielding 3 episodes.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry aims to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, resulting in a total of 2x cookies. However, he inadvertently baked 15 more cookies than intended, leading to a total of 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We are informed that Henry now has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110 to represent this situation.

Solving for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the gas by multiplying the number of gallons purchased (10) by the price per gallon ($3.00). This yields a total cost of $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the number of gallons purchased (10) by the cashback amount per gallon ($0.20). This results in a cashback amount of $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost to obtain the final cost of the gas after the rewards. Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups consumed by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups available to each individual. 

Beatrice's roll-ups can be represented as a rectangle with a width of 2 units and a length of 24 units. The area of this rectangle, which corresponds to the total number of roll-ups, is calculated as width times length: 2 * 24 = 48.

Similarly, Marcell's roll-ups can be represented as a rectangle with a width of 3 units and a length of 14 units. The area of this rectangle, which corresponds to the total number of roll-ups, is calculated as width times length: 3 * 14 = 42.

The total number of roll-ups available is the sum of the individual totals: 48 + 42 = 90.

Since both individuals consumed their entire amount, we can calculate the average by dividing the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the total amount of water the boat took on, we can first calculate the rate at which the boat takes on water. Given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can express this as a rate of 0.2 liters per foot.

Next, we need to find the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore. Since the shore was 64 seconds away and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance by dividing the total time by the time it took to row 20 feet: 64 / 16 = 4 intervals of 20 feet.

Now, we can multiply the total distance by the rate at which the boat takes on water to find the total amount of water taken on: 4 intervals * 20 feet/interval * 0.2 liters/foot = 1.6 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.6}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can employ a straightforward multiplication principle. 

Given that there are 4 teachers, each utilizing the whiteboard for 2 lessons daily, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings as follows:

Total number of cleanings = Number of teachers * Number of lessons per day * Number of cleanings per lesson
Total number of cleanings = 4 * 2 * 3
Total number of cleanings = 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. By multiplying the daily rate of flower planting (2 flowers) by the duration of the period (15 days), we obtain a preliminary count of 30 flowers. However, we must then account for the 5 flowers that failed to germinate, thereby necessitating a subtraction of 5 from the initial calculation.

The resulting total is 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can start by establishing the relationship between the capacities of Jamal's and Brittany's phones. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can express this as:

B = (1/6)D

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This can be written as:

B = 50D

Now, we can equate the two expressions for B:

(1/6)D = 50D

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

D = 300

Therefore, there are 300 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

300"
"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber. The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100. The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80. Therefore, the total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, we need to calculate the selling price of each type of board. Since the prices have increased by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15 per board = $150. The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120. Therefore, the total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up an equation based on the given ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can express the number of cups of water as (13/7)x.

The total amount of liquid used is the sum of the amount of sugar and water, which is equal to 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (13/7)x = 120

To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to eliminate the fraction:

7x + 13x = 840

Combine like terms:

20x = 840

Now, divide both sides by 20:

x = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 42"

a = 2
b = $60
n = 3

Total Cost = 2 * 3 * $60
Total Cost = $360

Therefore, John paid $360."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles can be represented as 5x.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. On the second day, 'x' containers were added, leading to a total of 10 + 5x vehicles.

We are given that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10 + 5x = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation yields:

5x = 20

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 4

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we first need to establish their current salaries. 

Given that Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago and increased by 30% to reach his current salary, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Let's denote Adrien's current salary as A. We know that A = $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000. Solving for A, we get A = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000.

Next, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation: A = 1.3 * Lylah's salary. Substituting A with $52,000, we get $52,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary. Solving for Lylah's salary, we get Lylah's salary = $52,000 / 1.3 = $40,000.

Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary increase, which is 40% of her old salary. 40% of $40,000 is 0.4 * $40,000 = $16,000. Therefore, Lylah's current salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $52,000 + $56,000 = $108,000.

"To determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile as x.

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters she stamped is 60/3 = 20. This implies that the remaining letters, which were already stamped, can be represented as x - 20.

We are given that the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie put stamps on 20 letters is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30 + 20
x = 50

Thus, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was 50.

"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of fish sausages as 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. This can be represented algebraically as:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6

Given that the number of chicken sausages is 38, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, to find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friend count by adding 20 to Lily's friend count.

Amy's friend count = Lily's friend count + 20
Amy's friend count = 50 + 20
Amy's friend count = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding Amy's and Lily's friend counts together.

Total friends = Amy's friend count + Lily's friend count
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing, we must first establish the cost of each individual item. Given that a pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon by multiplying the cost of a pepper by three, yielding $45. 

Subsequently, we can calculate the cost of an orange by subtracting $5 from the cost of a watermelon, resulting in $40.

With the individual costs established, we can now calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing. The cost of 4 watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. The cost of 20 peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. The cost of 10 oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

The total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total time spent on patients and the revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments.

First, we calculate the total time spent on patients. With 500 people visiting the hospital daily and each patient being seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent on patients can be determined as follows:

500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes

Converting this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated from the hospital's charges and the patients' payments. The hospital charges $150 per hour, and the patients pay $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated as:

Total revenue = (hospital's revenue + patients' revenue)
= (200 hours * $150/hour) + (500 people * $200/person)
= $30,000 + $100,000
= $130,000

The total cost is simply the hospital's revenue from its charges, as the patients' payments are not a cost:

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour
= $30,000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $130,000 - $30,000
= $100,000

The hospital makes a profit of $100,000."
"To determine the number of elves remaining, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them. This is equivalent to one-third of the initial workforce. 

The initial workforce consists of 60 elves. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. Therefore, 20 elves quit due to the incident.

The remaining workforce after this incident is 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Next, we consider the elves that quit after kids kick their shins. It is given that 10 elves quit in this instance. 

The number of elves remaining after this incident is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to identify the total number of semi-automatic vehicles. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To determine the number of worker bees, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can express this relationship as W = 2B. Additionally, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the total equation, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation, we get:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B = 2 * 200 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the weekly earnings of Jordan if he were to utilize his video game time for work, we must first calculate the total hours he would dedicate to work. Given that he spends 2 hours daily on video games, his weekly gaming time can be calculated as 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Subsequently, his weekly earnings can be determined by multiplying the total hours worked by his hourly wage, which is $10. Therefore, his weekly earnings would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we must first calculate the subtotal for the food items and the non-food items separately. The food items consist of milk and eggs, which cost $2 and $3, respectively. Therefore, the total cost of the food items is $2 + $3 = $5.

The non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost $3, $3, and $4, respectively. The total cost of these items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

Next, we must calculate the tax on the non-food items. Since the tax rate is 10%, we multiply the total cost of the non-food items by 0.10. This yields $10 * 0.10 = $1.

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items (including tax): $5 + $11 = $16.

Therefore, the total cost of John's purchases is $16.

$16"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we must first calculate the total expenses associated with cleaning the homes of his clients. 

The cost of bleach for 8 clients can be calculated as 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client, resulting in 16 bottles. Given that each bottle costs $2, the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.

Similarly, the cost of cloths for 8 clients can be calculated as 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client, resulting in 8 packs. Given that each pack costs $5, the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses can be found by adding the cost of bleach and cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is given as $92. To calculate his profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we must consider the rate at which he harvests his pineapples. Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the initial calculation yields 1000 pineapples per year. However, this is the total production, not the harvest rate.

Since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we can calculate the harvest rate by dividing the total production by the time interval between harvests. There are 4 quarters in a year, so the harvest rate is 1000 pineapples / 3 months = 1000 / 3 pineapples per month.

To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we multiply the harvest rate by the number of months in a year (12):

(1000 / 3) * 12 = 400 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 400 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we must first calculate the number of pieces in each box and then sum them.

The first box contains 500 Lego pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, which equates to 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box contains 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, resulting in 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

To obtain the total number of Lego pieces, we add the pieces from each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct phases.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the subsequent 6 hours, half of these bees return, which equates to 15 bees. This leaves 30 - 15 = 15 bees that have not yet returned.

In the next 6 hours, twice the number of bees that left in the initial 6 hours depart, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. Consequently, the total number of bees that have left the hive up to this point is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the initial 6 hours and have not yet returned is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

In the final 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the initial 6 hours return to the hive. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 75.

The final answer is 75."
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total cost of the tickets and then accounting for the change received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = (Cost of adult ticket) + (Cost of child ticket)
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Given that Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can calculate the amount she gave the cashier by adding the total cost to the change:

Amount given to the cashier = Total cost + Change
Amount given to the cashier = $22 + $8
Amount given to the cashier = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends Charlie and Dorothy have. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this relationship as:

Charlie's friends = 3x

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

James' friends = 4x
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the time at which the loser will arrive at their residence, we must first convert the distances to a common unit, in this case, feet. This is because the speeds are provided in feet per minute.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet. Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.

Next, we can calculate the time it takes for each individual to cover their respective distances:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve arrives first, we can determine the waiting time by subtracting Steve's time from Tim's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we must consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle. 

First, we calculate the total cost for bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * $0.25 = $2.50. 

Next, we calculate the total cost for tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * $0.25 = $2.25. 

Lastly, we calculate the cost for the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * $0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To determine the amount of change Carl receives, we must first calculate the total cost of the cookies. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack, and then multiplying the result by the cost per cookie.

Let's denote the number of packs as 'n' and the cost per cookie as 'c'. We are given that n = 10 and c = $0.10. Therefore, the total cost of the cookies is:

Total Cost = n * c
Total Cost = 10 * $0.10
Total Cost = $1

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the $10 bill:

Change = $10 - $1
Change = $9

Therefore, Carl receives $9 as change.

The final answer is: $9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the initial number of french fries in the pack.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as 'x'. We know that Dave ate 14 fries, and a seagull ate half of that amount. Therefore, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

After the seagull's action, the remaining fries are x - 14 - 7 = x - 21.

Next, three pigeons bullied the seagull away and ate 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries being consumed. The remaining fries are now (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.

A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which can be expressed as (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries after the raccoon's action are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

Simplifying the expression, we get (x - 30) - (2/3)x + 20 = (1/3)x - 10.

Finally, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This can be represented as (1/3)x - 10 - 1 = 5.

Solving for x, we have (1/3)x - 11 = 5. Adding 11 to both sides, we get (1/3)x = 16. Multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we must first calculate the total hours he spends on each type of day and then sum these values.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 3 hours per day. Since there are three of these days in a week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. Given that there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent on these days is 9 * 16 = 144 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 4 hours per day. Since there are two of these days in a week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. With 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent on these days is 8 * 16 = 128 hours.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is the sum of the hours spent on each type of day, which is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then convert the result to feet.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches.

Now, we can convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.

Total length in feet = (1200 + 720 + 2880) / 12
Total length in feet = 4800 / 12
Total length in feet = 400 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we must consider the monthly consumption of each ape species. 

Let's denote the number of bananas required by the monkeys as M, the gorillas as G, and the baboons as B. We are given that M = 200, G = 400, and B = 100. Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for 2 months.

The total number of bananas required for 2 months can be calculated as follows:

Total bananas = (M + G + B) * 2
Total bananas = (200 + 400 + 100) * 2
Total bananas = 700 * 2
Total bananas = 1400

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we must first calculate the total distance each individual ran. 

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth (15) by the length of the football field (100 yards), resulting in 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated by first determining the total distance she ran on the field (100 yards * 34 times = 3400 yards) and then adding the additional distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back (80 yards * 34 times = 2720 yards). Therefore, her total distance is 3400 + 2720 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find the difference in their distances, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4620}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent, we can employ the principle of additive finance. This involves calculating the cost of each item and subsequently summing these costs to arrive at the overall expenditure.

The cost of 4 pens can be calculated as 4 times the cost of a single pen, which is $1.5. Therefore, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Similarly, the cost of 2 notebooks can be determined by multiplying the cost of a single notebook by 2, yielding 2 * $4 = $8.

Lastly, the cost of the bond paper is given as $20.

By adding these individual costs together, we obtain the total expenditure: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we must consider the initial count, the tadpoles that emerged from their hiding places, and those that retreated. 

Initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 retreated to a rock. To find the current number of tadpoles Finn can see, we must subtract the number of tadpoles that retreated from the initial count.

The calculation is as follows: 11 (initial tadpoles) - 2 (tadpoles that retreated) = 9

Therefore, Finn can see 9 tadpoles in the pond.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can utilize the given information in a step-by-step manner. 

First, we establish the initial depth of water in the tank on Monday, which is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, resulting in a depth of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we are informed that the depth of the water on Wednesday is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To calculate this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday (24 feet) by two-thirds, which can be expressed as (2/3) * 24. 

Using the properties of fractions, we can simplify this expression as follows: (2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet.

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can analyze the information provided. 

Let's denote the number of starfish caught by Anakin as S, the number of sea horses as H, and the number of clownfish as C. We are given the following information:

1. Anakin caught 10 starfish (S = 10).
2. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught S - 5 starfish.
3. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught H - 3 sea horses.
4. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught C + 2 clownfish.

We can express Locsin's catches in terms of Anakin's catches as follows:

- Starfish: S - 5
- Sea horses: H - 3
- Clownfish: C + 2

We are also given the following information:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish (S = 10)
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses (H = 6)
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish (C = 3)

Substituting these values into the expressions for Locsin's catches, we get:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5

Now, we can calculate the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: S + H + C = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: (S - 5) + (H - 3) + (C + 2) = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is the sum of Anakin's and Locsin's catches: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase using an exponential function. The initial price is $20, and the price increases by 20% every 2 months.

Let's denote the price after n months as P(n). We can express the price increase as:

P(n) = P(0) * (1 + r)^n

where P(0) is the initial price ($20), r is the monthly increase rate (0.20), and n is the number of months.

We want to find P(36). Plugging in the values, we get:

P(36) = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^36
P(36) = 20 * (1.20)^36
P(36) = 20 * 6.656
P(36) ≈ 132.12

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $132.12.

The final answer is $132.12."
"To determine the total value of the toys, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A. Additionally, we know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4. Furthermore, we are informed that an action figure costs $5, thus A = $5.

Substituting the value of A into the equation D = 3A, we can calculate the cost of the doll: D = 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all toys using the following equation:

Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

"To determine the financial impact of Jackie's decision, we must consider the trade-off between the time spent on tax preparation and the associated income loss. By preparing her taxes herself, Jackie incurs a loss of 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of $35 per hour. This translates to a total loss of:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

In contrast, hiring an accountant incurs a fixed cost of $90.

To assess the financial gain from hiring an accountant, we subtract the cost from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we must first calculate the total cost of the computer accessories. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the items: 

Computer: €1090

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote Seth's current age as x and Brooke's current age as y.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as an equation: x = 2y.

In 2 years, their ages will be x + 2 and y + 2, respectively. The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + y + 2 = 28

Substituting x = 2y into the equation, we get:

2y + 2 + y + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

3y + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3y = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 8

Now that we have found Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's current age by substituting y = 8 into the equation x = 2y:

x = 2(8)
x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total miles walked in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays can be calculated as 5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. Thus, the total miles walked on weekends can be calculated as 2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles.

The total miles walked in a week is the sum of the miles walked on weekdays and weekends, which is 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

"To determine the total number of legs Jake observes, we must consider the number of legs associated with each type of creature. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs from the spiders. With 80 spiders, each having 8 legs, the total number of spider legs is 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs from the insects. There are 90 insects, each with 6 legs, resulting in a total of 90 * 6 = 540 legs.

Lastly, we consider the rare mutant invertebrates, which consist of 3 specimens, each having 10 legs. This yields a total of 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Combining these values, we obtain the total number of legs observed: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information systematically.

Let's denote the age of Sally Two as 'x'. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, we can equate their ages, resulting in x = 8.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so her age can be represented as 2x. Substituting the value of x, we get Granny Red's age as 2 * 8 = 16.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so her age can be represented as x + 3. Substituting the value of x, we get Sally Two's age as 8 + 3 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: x (Sally Thirty-two) + x (Sally Four) + 2x (Granny Red) + (x + 3) (Sally Two) = 4x + 3.

Substituting the value of x, we get 4(8) + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35.

The total age of the four birds is 35."
"To determine Jessica's annual debt payment, we must first calculate her monthly payment, which consists of the sum of the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

The minimum payment for her student loans is $300, her credit card's minimum is $200, and her mortgage's minimum is $500. Therefore, the total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica desires to pay 50% more than the minimum, we must calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. This can be computed as 0.5 * $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment to obtain Jessica's monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To determine her annual payment, we multiply this amount by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time required to prepare the potatoes, we must first calculate the time it takes to peel and cut a single potato. The time to peel a potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut it is 5 seconds. 

Converting the time to cut a potato to minutes, we have 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes. 

The total time to prepare one potato is the sum of these two values: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time required to prepare 60 potatoes by multiplying the time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds for easier understanding, we have 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we must first calculate the total revenue generated by the lemonade stand. Given that each glass is sold for $0.50 and 20 glasses are produced per gallon, the revenue per gallon can be calculated as:

Revenue per gallon = Number of glasses per gallon * Price per glass
= 20 * $0.50
= $10

Since the profit made is $25, we can establish the following equation:

Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$10 - Total Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:

$10 + $25 = $35

This represents the total cost for 1 gallon. As the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5, we can determine the cost of lemons per gallon by dividing the total cost by 1 gallon:

Cost of lemons per gallon = Total cost per gallon - Cost of sugar per gallon
= $35 - $5
= $30

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $30.

$30"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls on the team, we must first calculate the total number of Chinese participants. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants.

Total Asian participants = 240
Number of Japanese participants = 80
Total Chinese participants = Total Asian participants - Number of Japanese participants
= 240 - 80
= 160

Given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of Chinese boys

"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after accounting for his various expenses and donations, we can break down his expenditures into distinct categories.

First, we calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel. Zaid spends 1/4 of his monthly income on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500. He also spends 1/3 of his income on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000. The combined amount spent on rent and car fuel is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount after these expenditures is 6000 - 3500 = $2500.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250. The amount left after the donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

Finally, Zaid allocates $200 for his daughter's weekly expenses and $700 for his wife's household expenses, totaling $200 + $700 = $900. The amount left after these expenditures is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after accounting for all his expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can express this as B = 40.

We are also informed that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be represented as M = B - 4. Substituting the value of B, we get M = 40 - 4 = 36.

Furthermore, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10. Substituting the value of M, we get R = 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, we can calculate the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has: Total = B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total hours worked: 5 hours (first week) + 8 hours (second week) = 13 hours.

Next, we multiply the total hours worked by Lloyd's hourly wage: 13 hours * $10/hour = $130.

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks are $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of complementary probabilities. Given that the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the loser's share by subtracting the winner's share from the total number of votes.

Let's denote the total number of votes as 'T'. The winner's share can be expressed as (3/4)T. To find the loser's share, we subtract the winner's share from the total:

Loser's share = T - (3/4)T
= (1/4)T

Since we know the total number of students who voted is 80, we can substitute T = 80 into the equation:

Loser's share = (1/4) * 80
= 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can establish a relationship between the quantities of different flowers. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be expressed as 4x.

Additionally, we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. This relationship can be represented as 5x. We are also told that the total number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to solve for x.

Solving for x, we find that x = 200 / 5 = 40. 

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40, which yields 160. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Jean's current age, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J and Mark's current age as M. We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can express this as J = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old, half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old. Substituting this into the equation J = M + 2, we get J = 22 + 2 = 24.

Therefore, Jean's current age is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we must first calculate the total time taken by each team. 

The less well-rounded team's first runner covers the 400-meter distance in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the time taken by each runner can be calculated as follows:

Runner 1: 60 seconds
Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by the less well-rounded team is the sum of the individual times:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The well-rounded team, on the other hand, has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Therefore, their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The time difference between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we can utilize the concept of discrete uniform distribution. Given that the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of 1/6. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, resulting in a probability of 3/6 = 1/2.

On the other hand, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row can be calculated by considering the product of the probabilities of each event. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6, given that the first roll was even. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

To determine the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother as 'x'. Since Jenna picked half as many apples, the number of apples picked by Jenna can be represented as x/2.

We are informed that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, so we can equate x to 20. Therefore, x = 20.

Now, we can calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna by substituting the value of x into the expression x/2, which yields 20/2 = 10.

To find the total number of apples picked, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother: 20 (mother's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we must first calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters are housed in 10 cages, with each cage receiving 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are housed in a single pen, receiving 20 pieces of straw. Thus, the total straw used for the rabbits is 20.

The combined straw usage for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total straw usage is 160, the straw allocated for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are distributed across 3 cages, with each rat receiving 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw used for the rats is 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total straw used for the rats (18) by the number of rats (6), yielding 18 / 6 = 3.

However, this calculation is incorrect as it does not account for the fact that the 3 cages are equal groups. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

We know that the total straw used for the rats is 90, so we can set up the equation 18x = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 90 / 18 = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay to Benedict, we can utilize the formula for simple interest, which is given by:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = the total amount to be paid (principal + interest)
P = principal amount ($100)
r = monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02)
t = time in months (3)

Substituting the given values, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.02*3)
A = 100(1 + 0.06)
A = 100 * 1.06
A = 106

Therefore, Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x. The total cost consists of the cost per bag ($20) and the transportation cost ($2 per bag), so the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the individual cost per person, we must first calculate the total expenses incurred by the three friends. 

The cost of the tickets can be represented as $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which can be expressed as $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. 

The total cost of the rides is 2 times the cost of one ride, which is $33. Therefore, the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

To find the individual cost per person, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we first convert this duration to minutes, as the rate of collection is given in peaches per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the total minutes by the rate of collection, which is 2 peaches per minute. This yields 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we must first calculate the total weekly insect requirement and then divide it by the number of days in a week.

The total weekly insect requirement for the ducks is given as 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the daily insect requirement as follows:

Daily insect requirement = Total weekly insect requirement / Number of days in a week
= 3.5 pounds / 7
= 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we can break down the problem into several steps. 

First, we calculate the net change in the number of trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, this results in a total gain of 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

Initially, Tom starts with 50 trees. Adding the net gain of 80 trees to the initial number of trees gives us a total of 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which equals 39 trees. Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees gives us 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference in the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, we can analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors removed one-third of the flamingos, which equates to 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. The remaining 6 flamingos were then repainted white and reintroduced to the yard.

At this point, the number of pink flamingos is 12, and the number of white flamingos is 6. On Sunday, 18 additional pink flamingos were added to the yard. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30, and the total number of white flamingos remains 6.

The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos can be calculated as 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the amount of change Violetta will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Given that she requires 5 crayons, each costing $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

As Violetta has $20, the change she will receive can be found by subtracting the total cost from the amount she has:

Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we must first establish the cost of a single pen. Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, and the individual costs of a pencil ($1.20) and an eraser ($0.30), we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we can multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that 40 restaurants are to receive 2 pounds of carrots each, the total amount distributed can be calculated as 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

The remaining amount of carrots that will not be used can be found by subtracting the total distributed from the total available: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory. The total population of Soda is comprised of three distinct groups: men, women, and children. Given that the total population is 23786, and the number of men and women are 8417 and 9092, respectively, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the sum of men and women from the total population.

Let's denote the total population as P, the number of men as M, the number of women as W, and the number of children as C. We have:

P = M + W + C
23786 = 8417 + 9092 + C

To solve for C, we rearrange the equation:

C = P - (M + W)
C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we can break down the problem into three distinct intervals.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 cards. This brings her total to 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. This increases her total to 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards. This further increases her total to 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts. First, we need to find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Let's denote the number of sentences for each publisher as x. We know that x + x = 1000, since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. Solving for x, we get:

2x = 1000
x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, his earnings from Publisher B are:

500 sentences * 10 cents = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we can add his earnings from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must first calculate the volume of water he collects in the morning and the afternoon separately, then sum these volumes to obtain the total daily water intake.

In the morning, Baldur collects 5 pails of water, with each pail containing 5 liters. Therefore, the morning water collection can be calculated as 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur collects 6 pails of water, with each pail also containing 5 liters. Consequently, the afternoon water collection can be calculated as 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

The total daily water intake is the sum of the morning and afternoon collections, which is 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we must consider the monetary reward as a one-time payment, rather than a raise in salary. 

First, we calculate his earnings before the award. Given that he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

The award amount is $5,000, which is a one-time payment. Therefore, we add this amount to his pre-award earnings:

$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

Thus, John's total earnings for the year would be $109,000.

Final answer: $109,000"
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Given that each acre yields 5 tons of grapes and there are 10 acres, the total tons of grapes produced is 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Next, we need to convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes is equivalent to 2 barrels of wine, we can multiply the total tons of grapes by 2 to obtain the total barrels of wine. Therefore, 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must consider the various instances of cheese consumption throughout the week.

Carl's lunch consisted of a sandwich every day, with each sandwich utilizing 2 slices of cheese. Given that there are 7 days in a week, the total number of slices used for lunch can be calculated as 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

In addition to his lunch, Carl consumed cheese and egg omelets for breakfast on 3 days, with each omelet containing one more slice of cheese than a sandwich. Since a sandwich requires 2 slices, an omelet would require 3 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices used for breakfast can be calculated as 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

Furthermore, Carl prepared a large dish of macaroni and cheese, which necessitated the use of 8 slices of cheese.

To obtain the total number of slices used, we must sum the slices from each meal: 14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we must consider the initial quantities of each color and the additional pens she acquired. 

Janet initially possessed 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Subsequently, she procured 6 bags of blue pens, each containing 9 pens, and 2 bags of red pens, each containing 6 pens. 

The total number of blue pens can be calculated as 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens. Similarly, the total number of red pens is 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pens by summing the initial quantities and the additional pens: 
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98 pens.

Therefore, Janet now possesses 98 pens."
"To determine the required score on the sixth test, we must first calculate the total score of the first five tests. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we identify the lowest score as 71. Subtracting this from the total score yields 438 - 71 = 367.

To achieve an average of 93 on six tests, we multiply the desired average by the total number of tests: 93 * 6 = 558. 

Subsequently, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 558 - 367 = 191.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to attain an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down his riding activities into two distinct periods. 

In the first period, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers covered in this period is 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal reduced his frequency to 2 times a week and increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time. This can be calculated as 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times. Therefore, the total kilometers covered in this period is 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.

To find the overall total, we add the kilometers covered in both periods: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first establish the weight of each component. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as follows:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of a single candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose purchased over the three-day period, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of cakes she bought each day and then summing these values.

On Monday, Rose acquired 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she acquired 3 times the number of cakes she purchased on Monday, which equates to 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she acquired 5 times the number of cakes she purchased on Tuesday, which equates to 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To obtain the total number of cakes purchased, we can sum the values obtained for each day: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose purchased after the three-day period is 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To determine the cost of each cup, we can start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates equates to 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Next, we are given that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of 20 dozen cups can be calculated as $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the number of lawn mowing sessions required for Sara to afford the jacket and shoes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Sara wishes to purchase: the jacket and two pairs of shoes. The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of two pairs of shoes is $20 x 2 = $40. Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already possesses $10, so the amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60.

Given that she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up an equation to find the number of lawn mowing sessions required. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as 'x'. The equation can be written as:

4x = 60

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 60 / 4
x = 15

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to purchase the jacket and shoes.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs per day and white chickens producing 5 eggs per day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the perimeter of the local park, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Next, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed, which is 3 miles per hour:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the perimeter of the local park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We are given that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are also given that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

where y represents the number of customers on the third day. However, we are not directly solving for y, but rather the number of customers on the third day, which is given as 250.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we can set up the equation as follows:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500
x + x + 50 + y = 500
2x + 50 + y = 500

Since we are given that the total number of customers on the third day is 500, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x + y = 450

However, we are not solving for x or y, but rather the number of customers on the third day, which is given as 250.

The correct approach is to recognize that the total number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is 250. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

The correct answer is 250."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the following equations:

1) 2x - 16 = 4y (since the big pool has 4y gallons of water now)
2) x - 16 = y (since the small pool has y gallons of water now)

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging equation (2) to isolate x, we get x = y + 16.

Substituting x = y + 16 into equation (1), we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

2y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 2y from both sides:

16 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = y

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into the equation x = y + 16:

x = 8 + 16

x = 24

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to acquire the desired items, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we must calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to purchase: $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00.

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

Therefore, Lori must work 44 hours to earn sufficient funds to make the purchase.

Final answer: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay, which includes the initial amount borrowed and the additional 10% interest.

The additional amount is 10% of the initial amount of $2000, calculated as 0.1 x $2000 = $200. Therefore, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 x 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance can be found by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount needed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Subsequently, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + 11
= 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we must first establish their current ages based on the given information.

Given that Harriet's age is 21 years, and she is half the age of Zack, we can deduce that Zack's age is twice Harriet's age, which is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Furthermore, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can calculate Adrian's age as 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years can be calculated by summing their ages and dividing by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can begin by calculating the total points scored by the other three students. 

Let's denote Naomi's score as N, Yuri's score as Y, and Jojo's score as J. We are given that N = 68. 

We are also given that Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so we can express Yuri's score as Y = (1/2)N + 10. Substituting N = 68, we get Y = (1/2)(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44.

Furthermore, we know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna's score can be expressed as B = N + 17. Substituting N = 68, we get B = 68 + 17 = 85.

Now, we can find the total points scored by the three students who have scores:
N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points:
J = 251 - (N + Y + B) = 251 - 197 = 54.

The final answer is 54."
"To determine the total time spent on these activities, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time devoted to each type of puzzle and then summing the results.

Given that Carmen dedicates 10 minutes to completing a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to completing a sudoku puzzle, we can calculate the total time spent on each activity as follows:

Time spent on crossword puzzles: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes
Time spent on sudoku puzzles: 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes

The total time spent on these activities is the sum of the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we calculate the remaining water after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters.

Remaining water = Initial water - Water used
Remaining water = 120 - 90
Remaining water = 30 liters

Next, we consider the rainwater collected, which is twice the amount of the remaining water.

Rainwater = 2 * Remaining water
Rainwater = 2 * 30
Rainwater = 60 liters

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water to find the current amount of water in the tank.

Current water = Remaining water + Rainwater
Current water = 30 + 60
Current water = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to establish the number of petunias, which is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. This can be calculated as:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can calculate the amount spent in the second year as a fraction of the initial expenditure. Since the company spends a third of the initial amount, we can express this as:

Amount spent in the second year = (1/3) * $15,000
= $5,000

Now, we can find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years by adding the amounts spent in each year:

Total amount spent = Amount spent in the first year + Amount spent in the second year
= $15,000 + $5,000
= $20,000

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we can calculate the individual costs for Carlos and Benji and then sum them.

Carlos' cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the canoe (3 hours) by the hourly rate ($30). This yields a cost of $90.

Similarly, Benji's cost can be determined by multiplying the number of hours he used the banana boat raft (5 hours) by the hourly rate ($18), resulting in a cost of $90.

The total cost is the sum of these two individual costs, which is $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total duration of the round trip, we must consider the time spent on each leg of the journey. 

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, we can calculate the duration of the car trip as 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total duration of the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip, which is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

Therefore, the total duration of the round trip is 9 days."
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we must first calculate the total number of cards he possesses. 

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 water-type cards, he is left with 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards. Subsequently, he acquires 14 grass-type cards, bringing his total grass-type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards in James' collection is the sum of the individual card types: 30 (fire-type) + 34 (grass-type) + 32 (water-type) = 96 cards.

The probability of selecting a water-type card can be calculated by dividing the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards: 32/96. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8, resulting in 4/12. Further simplification yields 1/3.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounding to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water-type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To determine the total cost of Chad's meal, we must consider the individual components and their respective costs. The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad then adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. Additionally, he selects two sauces for $0.25 each, resulting in a total of $0.50. Furthermore, he upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Lastly, he utilizes a gift card worth $5.00.

To calculate the total cost, we can sum the individual components:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.50
6. Upgrade: $3.00
7. Gift card: -$5.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can employ a straightforward approach by considering the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Let's denote Kalinda's rate as K and her mom's rate as M. We are given that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, so K = 4. Since her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, we can express her rate as M = K/2 = 2.

The combined rate at which they work together is the sum of their individual rates, which is K + M = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we first need to calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. This can be found by taking 30% of the total number of watermelons produced.

Let's denote the total number of watermelons as 'T'. The number of watermelons ready for harvest is then 0.3T.

Given that T = 120, we can calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest as:

0.3 * 120 = 36

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining after the initial harvest. This can be calculated by subtracting the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total:

Remaining watermelons = T - 0.3T = 0.7T

Substituting T = 120, we get:

Remaining watermelons = 0.7 * 120 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons, which is the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. This can be calculated as:

3/4 * 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Finally, to determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks from the remaining watermelons:

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we must consider the initial purchase price, the tax incurred, and the registration fees.

The initial cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of vehicles (12) by the cost per unit ($20,000). This yields a total cost of $240,000.

Next, we must calculate the tax paid on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.10). Multiplying the total cost of the cars ($240,000) by the tax rate (0.10) results in a tax liability of $24,000.

Finally, we must consider the registration fees for the cars. With 12 vehicles, each costing $1,000, the total registration fees amount to $12,000.

The total cost of the fleet can be determined by summing the initial cost of the cars, the tax liability, and the registration fees. Therefore, the total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can utilize the information provided to establish a relationship between the number of shells collected on Monday and Tuesday.

Let's denote the number of shells collected by Robert on Monday as R. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, the number of shells collected by Kylie on Monday can be expressed as R + 5.

We are given that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday, so R = 20. Consequently, the number of shells collected by Kylie on Monday is 20 + 5 = 25.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be represented as 2 * (R + 5), where R is the number of shells collected by Kylie on Monday. Substituting the value of R, we get 2 * (20 + 5) = 2 * 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can establish a direct relationship between the two quantities. 

Let's denote the number of ants as A and the number of bugs as B. We are provided with the information that A = 50. Since B is half the value of A, we can express B as B = A/2. Substituting the given value of A, we obtain B = 50/2 = 25.

To find the total number of insects, we can add the number of ants and bugs: Total insects = A + B = 50 + 25 = 75.

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. Since one-third of the penguins jumped into the ocean and another one-third went inside the cave, we can calculate the total number of penguins that left as follows:

Total penguins = 36
Penguins that jumped into the ocean = 36 / 3 = 12
Penguins that went inside the cave = 36 / 3 = 12

The total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot is the sum of those that jumped into the ocean and those that went inside the cave: 12 + 12 = 24.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines required to meet Steve's tomato consumption needs, we must first establish the total weekly demand. Since Steve consumes twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend's daily consumption is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes. Therefore, their combined daily consumption is 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes.

Multiplying this by 7 days yields a weekly consumption of 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so the number of vines needed can be calculated by dividing the total weekly demand by the production capacity of a single vine: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve requires 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato needs.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions and John requires 4 slices per person, we can calculate the total number of slices needed by multiplying the number of friends (20) by the number of slices per person (4).

Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in whole units, we must divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the minimum number of pizzas required. 

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we can model this situation using a simple iterative process. Initially, Ram starts with 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he refills the pens by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens to create one full pen. This process can be repeated until all the pens are used.

Let's denote the number of full pens Ram can make as 'n'. Since each full pen requires 5 empty pens, the number of empty pens after 'n' iterations will be 5n. However, Ram starts with 25 pens, so the total number of pens he can have is the sum of the initial pens and the pens he can make: 25 + 5n.

We want to find the maximum value of 'n' such that 25 + 5n is less than or equal to 25 (since Ram cannot have more pens than he initially had). This can be represented as:

25 + 5n ≤ 25

Subtracting 25 from both sides gives:

5n ≤ 0

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:

n ≤ 0

Since 'n' represents the number of full pens Ram can make, it must be a non-negative integer. However, the inequality n ≤ 0 is not possible for a non-negative integer. This means that Ram cannot make any full pens from the 25 pens.

Therefore, Ram will have the initial 25 pens.

Final answer: 25"
"To determine the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can follow a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the initial total amount of money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his allowance. This can be done by adding $20 (his allowance) and $10 (the extra amount), resulting in a total of $30.

Next, we need to account for the fact that the money tripled in value over the course of the year. To do this, we multiply the initial total amount by 3, which gives us $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as J + 5 - 2.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages. This yields Joan's age as 20 + 5 = 25 and Mary's age as 20 + 5 - 2 = 23.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages by adding Jessa's, Joan's, and Mary's ages: J + (J + 5) + (J + 5 - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit A, which is 30% of the total number of students. This can be expressed as 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students who exited through A from the total number of students to obtain the remaining students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who exited through B from the remaining students to determine the number of students who exited through C: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'r'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2r.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2r = 54 to find the value of 'r'. Solving for 'r', we get r = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's amount, resulting in 27 + 6 = 33 candies for James.

To determine how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we must consider the books each individual possesses and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly possesses 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's possession, as well as her own. This results in a total of 2 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Dolly's books from Pandora) = 4 books read by Dolly.

Pandora possesses 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's possession, as well as her own. This results in a total of 1 (Pandora's book) + 1 (Pandora's book from Dolly) = 2 books read by Pandora.

The collective total of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we must first calculate the total number of letters exchanged between Mike and his penpals. Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, the total number of letters exchanged is 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week, resulting in a total of 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters exchanged per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week can be calculated as follows:

Time spent writing per week = Total pages written per week * Time taken to write one page
Time spent writing per week = 60 pages/week * 6 minutes/page
Time spent writing per week = 360 minutes/week

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time spent writing per week = 360 minutes/week / 60
Time spent writing per week = 6 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours per week writing."
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we must first calculate the total minutes utilized for his daily call with his supervisor. Given that he has a 15-minute call with his supervisor each day and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call can be calculated as follows:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

In addition to this, Jason has utilized an extra 300 minutes for calls to other individuals. Therefore, the total minutes used can be found by adding these two values:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

To find the remaining minutes in Jason's plan, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Griffin had initially as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24
2. K = 5
3. B = 2K
4. C = K - 3
5. G - K - B - x + C = 27

Substituting the given values, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 - x + (5 - 3) = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 - 10 - x + 2 = 27

Combine like terms:

9 - x = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

-x = 18

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 18

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is equal to twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total amount paid by the makeup artist, we must first calculate the total hours worked over the duration of the project. The artist works 6 hours per day, 4 days a week, for a total of 5 weeks. This yields a total of 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The hourly rate is $250, so the total cost before discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

A 10% discount is applied to the total cost, resulting in a discount amount of 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount paid by the artist is therefore $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual expenditures: $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags).

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of individuals.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiplying the result by the cost per pound.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'n', the weight per bag as 'w', and the cost per pound as 'c'. We are given that n = 4, w = 50 pounds, and c = $1.50.

The total weight of onions can be calculated as n * w, which equals 4 * 50 = 200 pounds.

The total cost can be determined by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound, resulting in 200 * $1.50 = $300.

Therefore, the total cost of the onions is $300."
"To determine the difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister, we must first calculate the total number of cookies each consumed.

Given that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can calculate her total cookies as follows:

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we can calculate her Monday cookies as:

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we can calculate her Tuesday cookies as:

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

The total number of cookies eaten by Sue is the sum of her Monday and Tuesday cookies:

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Now, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each individual by multiplying the number of cookies by 200 calories per cookie:

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister is:

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Given that the school is 50% girls and consists of 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as 50% of 3 classes, which is equivalent to 1.5 classes. Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We are also provided with the information that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the third class can be calculated as 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. With a total of 60 students in the school, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school. The first and second classes have a combined total of 15 + 12 = 27 boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

We start with the initial number of apps, which is 61. Then, we subtract the number of apps Travis deleted, which is 9, resulting in 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps Travis downloaded, which is 18, yielding 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W and the number of cougars killed last night as C. We are given that W = 10 and C = 15.

We are also told that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is 3C = 3(15) = 45.

Additionally, we know that the number of cougars killed today is three fewer than the number killed last night, so the number of cougars killed today is C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today: W + C + (3C) + (C - 3) = 10 + 15 + 45 + 12 = 82.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is currently on, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the starting floor as 'x'. According to the problem, Bill rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. This can be expressed as 4x + 6.

Given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can set up the equation 4x + 6 = 3 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get:

4x + 6 = 3
4x = -3
x = -3/4

However, since the starting floor cannot be negative, we can re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the original statement: ""he rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6."" This implies that the resulting floor is greater than the starting floor. Therefore, we can set up the equation 4x + 6 = y, where y is the resulting floor.

Given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can set up the inequality 4x + 6 > 3. Solving for x, we get:

4x + 6 > 3
4x > -3
x > -3/4

Since x represents the starting floor, it must be a non-negative integer. The smallest non-negative integer greater than -3/4 is 0. However, the problem states that Bill starts on the 3rd floor, so we can assume x = 3.

Now, we can find the resulting floor by substituting x = 3 into the equation 4x + 6:

4(3) + 6 = 12 + 6
4(3) + 6 = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide, which is 30% less than Mitchel's 30 times. This can be achieved by finding 30% of 30 and subtracting it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
Therefore, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Next, we can calculate the number of times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times the number of times Anne went down. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we must first calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas purchases 40 cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This can be achieved by adding the initial number of cows in each stall to the number of new cows and dividing by the total number of stalls.

Let's denote the initial number of cows in each stall as 'x'. The total number of cows in each stall after the purchase can be expressed as (x + 40) / 20. Since we are interested in 8 stalls, we can multiply this value by 8 to obtain the total number of cows in those stalls.

(x + 40) / 20 * 8 = (x + 40) * 0.4

However, we are not given the initial number of cows in each stall, so we cannot directly calculate the value of 'x'. Nevertheless, we can express the number of cows in 8 stalls as a function of 'x':

Number of cows in 8 stalls = (x + 40) * 0.4

Since we are not provided with any additional information, we cannot determine the exact value of 'x'. However, we can express the number of cows in 8 stalls as a multiple of the initial number of cows in each stall.

The final answer is 0.4x + 16."
"To determine the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the value of each type of currency and subsequently summing these values.

First, we calculate the total value of the coins: 100 pennies contribute $1, 40 nickels contribute $2, and 20 dimes contribute $2. Therefore, the total value of the coins is $1 + $2 + $2 = $5.

Next, we consider the value of the dollar bills, which is 40 bills multiplied by $1, resulting in $40.

Combining the values of the coins and the dollar bills, we obtain a total of $5 + $40 = $45.

Therefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we must first calculate the number of 10-foot sections that comprise the tree. Given that the tree is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by 10 to obtain the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood can be calculated as follows:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

However, the termites have consumed 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood that was eaten, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

The weight of the remaining wood can be found by subtracting the weight of the consumed wood from the total weight of the redwood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the total amount Nancy owes, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the overdue books, which is the product of the number of overdue books and the per-book fine. In this case, the number of overdue books is 8, and the per-book fine is $0.50. Therefore, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Next, we consider the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue, which is $2.00. This fee is a fixed amount that is added to the total cost of the overdue books.

To find the total amount Nancy owes, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can start by establishing the number of apples and bananas each individual possesses.

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has can be expressed as (x + 8). We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Solving for x, we find that x = 44. This implies that Jamal has 44 apples.

Given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, the number of bananas Jamal has can be represented as (x + 4), which is equal to 48.

Now, since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, the number of bananas Andrea has can be calculated as (48 / 2) = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:

Total fruits = (x + 8) + (x + 4) + (48 / 2)
Total fruits = (44 + 8) + (44 + 4) + 24
Total fruits = 52 + 48 + 24
Total fruits = 124

The final answer is: $\boxed{124}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she plans to bake. This can be achieved by summing the number of cookies she intends to bake today and tomorrow.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required to produce a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12 and then multiplying by 2.

Total flour needed = (66 cookies / 12) * 2 cups
= 5.5 * 2 cups
= 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final answer is 11."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of pennies by the fraction 2/3. 

The calculation yields: (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can then multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny to obtain the total dollar amount.

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. We start by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box, which yields a preliminary count of 250 marbles. Subsequently, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to this total, resulting in a final count of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can establish the following relationships based on the given information:

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. C = 6 (Chris has 6 trees)
2. F = C/2 (Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has)
3. H = 2F + 5 (Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has)

We can substitute the value of C into equation (2) to find the value of F:

F = 6/2
F = 3

Now that we have the value of F, we can substitute it into equation (3) to find the value of H:

H = 2(3) + 5
H = 6 + 5
H = 11

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3
H - F = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the combined total of the girls' funds, we can utilize a straightforward additive approach. 

Carmen's financial resources are $100. Samantha's financial resources exceed Carmen's by $25, resulting in $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy's financial resources surpass Samantha's by $50, yielding $125 + $50 = $175.

The sum of their combined financial resources can be calculated by adding the individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To determine the total price of the house, we must consider the additional fees associated with the purchase. The selling price of the property is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which equates to $17,500. Furthermore, the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, amounting to $42,000.

The total additional fees can be calculated by adding the brokerage fee and the transfer fee: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

The total price of the house is then obtained by adding the selling price and the total additional fees: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we must consider the various costs associated with the transaction. The selling price of the house is $400,000. 

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This equates to 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, resulting in 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000. 

The total amount paid by Mr. Tan is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee, which is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. Subtracting this amount from the selling price yields the net proceeds: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To determine the total time elapsed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we must consider the time required for the oil to reach the desired temperature and the time needed for cooking.

First, we calculate the additional time required for the oil to reach 400 degrees, which is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. This can be computed as 20 minutes + 0.4 * 20 minutes = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we find the time needed to cook the chicken, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Finally, we sum the time to heat up the oil and the time to cook the chicken to obtain the total elapsed time. This yields 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising, we can employ the concept of linear algebra. Let's denote the cost of a newspaper ad as 'n' and the number of newspaper ads as 'x'. Similarly, let's denote the cost of a television ad as 't' and the number of television ads as 'y'. We are given that n = $5, t = $75, x = 50, and y = 15.

The total cost of newspaper ads can be calculated as the product of the cost per ad and the number of ads: nx = 5 * 50 = $250.

The total cost of television ads can be calculated as the product of the cost per ad and the number of ads: ty = 75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads: nx + ty = 250 + 1125 = $1375.

Therefore, the total amount spent on buying all the ads is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the information provided. 

First, we establish that the total number of balls is 16. Since half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as 16 / 2 = 8. 

Next, we recognize that half of the golf balls are blue. Therefore, the number of blue golf balls can be found by dividing the total number of golf balls by 2, yielding 8 / 2 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary acquired, we must first calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them together.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, resulting in 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag, however, has a hole, which reduces its M&M count to half that of the first bag, yielding 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we can calculate the total number of M&Ms by adding the M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary obtained is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in the two houses, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of windows in the bedrooms and the number of additional windows.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is given by the product of these two values: 3 bedrooms/house * 2 windows/bedroom * 2 houses = 12 windows.

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Each house has 4 such windows, so the total number of these additional windows is 4 windows/house * 2 houses = 8 windows.

Finally, we sum the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to obtain the overall total: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change the cashier should provide, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

The total cost is calculated as follows:

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

Since the mother paid $20, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid:

$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

Therefore, the cashier should provide $4.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we must first calculate the total number of stitches allocated to the collar and rosette. The collar's stitch count is one-tenth of the body's stitch count, which is 900 stitches. Therefore, the collar's stitch count is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette's stitch count is twice that of the collar, resulting in 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total stitch count for the sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitch counts for the body, collar, and rosette from this total yields the combined stitch count for the two sleeves: 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the combined stitch count by 2 to determine the stitch count for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the number of packets of tomato seeds as 't' and the number of packets of celery seeds as 'c'. We are given that t = 20 and c = 80.

The cost of a packet of tomato seeds is $40, and the cost of a packet of celery seeds is $30. Therefore, the total cost can be represented as:

Total Cost = 40t + 30c
= 40(20) + 30(80)
= 800 + 2400
= 3200

This calculation yields a total cost of $3200 for the seeds.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each component individually.

First, we know that the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which results in 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines belong to Sean, so we can calculate his lines from the first scene as 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, yielding 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so we can calculate his lines from the second scene as 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A, which is 2/5 of the total 80 cards. This yields (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we subtract the cards with the letter A from the total to obtain the remaining cards: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B, which is 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards. This gives us (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Subtracting the cards with the letter B from the remaining cards yields 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Now, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C, which is 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards. This results in (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, we determine the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the cards with the letter C from the remaining cards: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To determine the total time required to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time spent on each type of hole and then summing the results.

Let's denote the time to dig a small hole as $s$ and the time to dig a large hole as $l$. We are given that $s = 3$ minutes and $l = 10$ minutes. The total time can be expressed as:

Total time = (number of small holes) × (time to dig a small hole) + (number of large holes) × (time to dig a large hole)
Total time = 30s + 15l
Total time = 30(3) + 15(10)
Total time = 90 + 150
Total time = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
Total time (in hours) = 240 minutes / 60
Total time (in hours) = 4 hours

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can utilize the given information that their current combined age is 20. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We have the equation M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10, and Marco's age will be C + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years can be expressed as (M + 10) + (C + 10), which simplifies to M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation, resulting in 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

The first piece of information states that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

The second piece of information states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be represented by the equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can simplify the second equation by distributing the 3 on the right-hand side:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is 6."

"To determine the total number of spots, we first need to establish the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba and a cobra has 70 spots, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2, yielding 35 spots per mamba.

With 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park, we can calculate the total number of spots as follows:

Total spots on cobras = 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total by 2:
4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total cost of pizzas, we must first calculate the total number of individuals attending the event. This can be achieved by summing the number of team members, coaches, and their respective guests.

The number of team members is given as 12, while the number of coaches is 3. Furthermore, each team member brings 2 guests, resulting in a total of 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Therefore, the total number of individuals is 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of individuals by 3. This yields 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Given that each pizza costs $15, the total cost can be determined by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since each gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can calculate the number of beads used by dividing the length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we must first calculate the number of stories each individual wrote in the second week. This can be achieved by doubling the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

Alani's initial story count in the first week was 20, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.

Braylen's initial story count in the first week was 40, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.

Margot's initial story count in the first week was 60, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we can calculate the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks and then sum them up.

Alani's total story count: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total story count: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total story count: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is the sum of these individual totals: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Current brother's age = 9 * 2 = 18 years

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop, we must first calculate the total amount of money she possesses. This can be achieved by summing the value of her quarters and dimes.

The value of her quarters is 5 times the value of a single quarter, which is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents. Similarly, the value of her dimes is 2 times the value of a single dime, which is 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents. Therefore, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find the amount of money Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we can employ a systematic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of stars on the flag. The flag consists of three rows of 8 stars, two rows of 6 stars, and the remaining rows are of 5 stars. 

Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. The total number of stars on the flag can be expressed as: 
8 * 3 + 6 * 2 + 5 * x = 76

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
24 + 12 + 5x = 76
36 + 5x = 76
5x = 40
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks have a limited capacity, we must divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the minimum number of trucks needed. This can be represented by the following equation:

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, the minimum number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can employ the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time, as encapsulated by the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at a speed of 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can deduce that the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour.

Substituting the given distance of 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane into the formula, we obtain:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. We are given that Ali, who has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy, who has 5 fewer medals than Ali, together have a total of 10 times the number of medals given out. This can be expressed as an equation:

22 + (22 - 5) = 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

22 + 17 = 10x
39 = 10x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

Since the number of medals given out must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as fractional medals are not feasible in this context. However, the question does not explicitly state that the number of medals given out must be a whole number, so we can provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults. Since each of the 4 adults receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars, which are 40 - 24 = 16, are to be distributed equally among the 8 children. To find the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To determine Susan's total earnings, we must first calculate the total duration of her work session. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which equates to a duration of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 3 hours by 60, yielding 180 minutes.

However, Susan pauses for a 30-minute interval, so we must subtract this from the total minutes she works. This results in 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Given that Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work, we can calculate her earnings by dividing the total minutes worked by 10. This gives us 150 / 10 = 15 intervals. Multiplying the number of intervals by her earnings per interval, we obtain 15 * $5 = $75.

Therefore, Susan's total earnings for the online task are $75."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we first need to establish their initial point totals. 

Given that Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, we can calculate their initial point totals as follows:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, all players receive an additional point if they have more than 20 points. Since all players have surpassed this threshold, they will each receive an extra point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we can calculate the total points of all three players by summing their updated point totals:

Total points = 22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we must first calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son, being 8 years old, washed 8 oranges, while the youngest son, being half as old as the oldest, washed 4 oranges.

The sum of oranges washed by the sons is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Given that Will initially purchased 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges can be calculated as follows:

Unwashed oranges = Total oranges - Oranges washed
= 15 - 12
= 3

Therefore, there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has completed over the two days, we must first calculate the number of each activity performed on each day and then sum these values.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, reduced his squats by 10, and doubled his dumbbell presses.

The number of pushups on the second day is 100 + 20 = 120. The number of squats on the second day is 50 - 10 = 40. The number of dumbbell presses on the second day is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total count of activities, we sum the number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses for both days: 100 + 120 + 50 + 40 + 20 + 40 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration for which a 42 kg bag of rice will last in a household with 5 members consuming rice at both lunch and dinner, we must first calculate the total daily rice consumption.

Each individual consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are two meals per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg. With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

To find the number of weeks the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg):

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the deviation from Sam's target, we must first calculate the total number of crates sold during the week. We are given that he sold 20 crates over the weekend, and the number of crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 

Let's denote the number of crates sold on Monday and Friday as x. Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can set up the following equation:

20 + 15 + 12 + 18 + x + x = 120

Combine like terms:

65 + 2x = 120

Subtract 65 from both sides:

2x = 55

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 27.5

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sam sold 27 crates on Monday and Friday.

Now, we can calculate the total number of crates sold:

20 + 15 + 12 + 18 + 27 + 27 = 100

To find the deviation from the target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target:

120 - 100 = 20

Sam was 20 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can analyze the bidding process step by step. The bids on the desk increase by $50 each time, and there were three other individuals who made a bid. 

The sequence of bids can be represented as follows: $200, $250, $300, and $350. Since Carmen bids after each of the other three individuals, her bids are also $200, $250, and $300. 

The final bid was $350, and to find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the desk to the last bid. However, we must also consider the bids made by the other three individuals. 

The total cost of the bids made by the other three individuals is $150 ($50 + $50 + $50). 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the desk by adding the cost of the desk to the last bid and the total cost of the bids made by the other three individuals. 

$350 (final bid) + $300 (Carmen's last bid) + $150 (bids made by the other three individuals) = $800

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of John's driving service, we must first determine the total distance traveled in a year. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily round-trip distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

With a 5-day workweek, the weekly distance traveled is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. Given that John works for 50 weeks per year, the total miles driven annually is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving is calculated by multiplying the total miles driven by the cost per mile, which is $2. Therefore, the total driving cost per year is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

In addition to the driving cost, John also receives a monthly bonus of $150. To find the total annual bonus, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12, yielding $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total annual cost is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he spent exercising on Monday and Sunday. 

Given that Peter exercised for 16 minutes on Monday and 23 minutes on Sunday, the combined time is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter aims to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can calculate this as 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the configuration of the pages. 

When a tabloid is folded in half, it creates two sides: left and right. Each side consists of 16 pages, with the left side having pages 1-16 and the right side having pages 17-32. 

Considering the front and back of each side, we can categorize the pages as follows:

- The left side has 8 pages on the front (pages 1-8) and 8 pages on the back (pages 9-16).
- The right side has 8 pages on the front (pages 17-24) and 8 pages on the back (pages 25-32).

Since each side requires 16 pages, and we have two sides, the total number of pages is 16 + 16 = 32. However, this count includes the pages on both the front and back of each side. 

To account for the front and back, we can consider the configuration as two separate sets of 16 pages each. Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper required is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Annika initially possesses $50. She then allocates $25 for food and snacks, and an additional $10 for rides. The total expenditure can be calculated as $25 + $10 = $35.

Subtracting the total expenditure from the initial amount yields $50 - $35 = $15.

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x and the number of books sold in the current year as y.

We are given that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. This implies that the total number of books sold over the two years is 250 - 50 = 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + y = 200

We are also given that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. This relationship can be expressed as:

x = 2y

Substituting the expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2y + y = 200
3y = 200
y = 200/3
y = 66.67

Since y represents the number of books sold in the current year, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year as:

x = 2y
x = 2 * 66.67
x = 133.33

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:

Total earnings in the second year = y * 20
= 66.67 * 20
= 1333.33

The final answer is: $1333.33"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we must consider both his hourly wage and the bonus he receives. 

Watson's daily earnings can be calculated by multiplying his hourly wage ($10) by the number of hours he works in a day (10 hours), resulting in a daily income of $100. Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are $100 * 5 = $500. 

Given that there are 4 weeks in April, his total weekly earnings for the month are $500 * 4 = $2000. 

Furthermore, he receives a $300 bonus for the month, as the company performed well. Therefore, his total earnings for April are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate the percentage of people he lost to by multiplying the total number of people he wrestled (20) by the percentage of people he lost to (0.8).

20 * 0.8 = 16

Therefore, John lost to 16 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the total number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning, we can express this as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

This leaves 20 loaves unsold. The remaining loaves are then divided equally between the afternoon and evening, so we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Given that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weekly weight loss rate as follows:

Weekly weight loss rate = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and we know Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds by dividing the total weight loss by the weekly weight loss rate:

Number of weeks = Total weight loss / Weekly weight loss rate
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total savings, we must first calculate the original cost of the items and the discounted cost. 

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2. Therefore, the total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2. Thus, the total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated by subtracting the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs caused by the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. The serum induces the growth of an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. 

We can model this situation using the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. This means that every 15 days, the person will experience the growth of both an extra arm and an extra leg. 

Given that the person drinks the serum for 15 days, we can calculate the number of times the LCM occurs within this timeframe. Since 15 is the LCM, it will occur once in 15 days. 

Therefore, the person will grow 1 extra arm and 1 extra leg, resulting in a total of 2 new limbs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already acquired.

The cost of 6 business suits can be calculated as 6 * $100 = $600. Additionally, the cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Furthermore, the cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500, resulting in a total of $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of the items purchased is the sum of these amounts: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, we subtract this total from Theo's initial budget of $6000 to find the remaining amount available for gifts: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo aims to save $2000, we subtract this from the remaining amount to determine the amount he needs to spend on gifts: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo needs to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the daily egg consumption and then multiplying it by the number of days in a week.

Let's consider the family's egg consumption as follows:

- Three individuals consume 3 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
- Two individuals consume 2 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Combining these two groups, the total daily egg consumption is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. Based on the given information, we have the following equations:

1. Q = 30 (Quinn's age)
2. J = Q - 3 (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)
3. T = J + 5 (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)

Substituting the value of Q into equation (2), we get J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, substituting the value of J into equation (3), we get T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the current population of Chile, we can employ a step-by-step approach to solve the problem.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46 years old. Therefore, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. Since the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, we can express this relationship as:

P/2 = 3000 * 40

Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:

P = 3000 * 40
P = 120,000

However, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

P/2 = 120,000

Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:

P = 240,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 240,000.

The final answer is: 240,000"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of people who attended Martha's party, we must first calculate the total number of individuals invited. This can be achieved by summing the product of the number of families and the number of people in each family. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, resulting in 2 x 6 = 12 individuals. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, yielding 3 x 4 = 12 individuals. The total number of individuals invited is therefore 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness, so we subtract 8 from the total number of individuals invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 individuals who were unable to attend had prior commitments. This equates to 8 / 4 = 2 individuals. 

Subtracting these 2 individuals from the total number of individuals who were initially expected to attend, we arrive at 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people attended Martha's party."
"To determine the total weight of marbles, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Solomon initially acquired 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and subsequently received 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. 

The number of marbles his father gave him is calculated as (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

Adding these to the initial 20 marbles, we obtain a total of 20 + 8 = 28 marbles. 

The store already possessed 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the pool, is given by the product of its length, width, and height.

Given that the pool's dimensions are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in height, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume (V) = Length (L) * Width (W) * Height (H)
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Next, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can utilize the given ratios and the known quantity of boys. 

Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N. We are given that B = 30. 

We are also given that the number of girls is three times the number of boys, so G = 3B = 3 * 30 = 90.

Furthermore, the number of nongendered children is one-tenth the number of boys, so N = (1/10)B = (1/10) * 30 = 3.

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can establish a proportion to solve for the number of poles.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the ratio, the number of electric wires is 3 times the number of poles, so we can express the number of wires as 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can start by calculating the total number of people present initially. The total number of people is the sum of men and women, which is 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who departed as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

Given that 22 men remained at the party, the number of men who left can be found by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

As a result, the number of women who left can be calculated by subtracting the number of men who left from the total number of people who left:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7

Finally, to find the number of women left at the party, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can establish a relationship between the costs of the magazine, book, and pen using the given information.

Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M, the cost of the book as B, and the cost of the pen as P. We are provided with the following information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book: M = B/2
2. The book costs $4: B = $4
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine: P = M - $1

Substituting the value of B into the first equation, we get:
M = $4/2 = $2

Now, substituting the value of M into the third equation, we get:
P = $2 - $1 = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"To determine the total number of boxes required to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils. We are given that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Additionally, her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We are also given that Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is the sum of Jam's pencils and Meg's pencils, which is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since we know the total number of pencils is 120, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 + 46 = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 48 = 120

Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get:

3x = 72

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 24

Since x represents the number of pencils in each box, and we know that each box can hold 24 pencils, we can conclude that each box can indeed hold 24 pencils.

To find the total number of boxes required, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the combined effects of cooling and dilution. 

Let's denote the initial volume of the coffee as V. When 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, resulting in a temperature of (V - 5*12) degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can set up the equation:

(V - 5*12) = V - 65

Solving for V, we get:

V = 85

This means the initial volume of the coffee is 85 milliliters.

When 15 milliliters of cream is added, the total volume of the coffee becomes 85 + 15 = 100 milliliters. The coffee is now 100 milliliters weaker than its original strength.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as 'x'. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x.

We are given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. This implies that the total number of new records obtained is 7. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is equal to the total number of new records obtained, which is 7.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

2x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 7/2

x = 3.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the 5 people brought in 3 old records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers, which is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Given that the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers, which is the difference between the total number of employees and the number of junior programmers:

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers:

Salary of junior programmers = $2000 per month
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total salaries of junior and senior programmers:

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who initially boarded the bus as 'x'. 

We are given that 5 people boarded at the first stop and 8 more boarded at the second stop. However, 7 people disembarked at the second stop. The total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we find: x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can analyze the sequence of events that affect his lollipop supply.

Initially, Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that alter his lollipop count. 

First, he consumes 2 lollipops on his way to school, reducing his supply to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. 

Next, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in a decrease of 14 lollipops, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Subsequently, Oscar purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave away, which equates to 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Consequently, his total lollipop count increases to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Following this, he consumes 3 lollipops that night, reducing his supply to 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Lastly, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in a final count of 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given recharge rate. The phone's charge increases by 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. Given that the phone is currently at 60% charged, we need to calculate the additional charge required to reach 100%.

The remaining charge needed is 100% - 60% = 40%. Since the recharge rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to achieve this additional charge as follows:

Time = Additional charge / Recharge rate
Time = 40% / 1% / 3 minutes
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has after the sequence of events, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother presents her with an additional 10 lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Following this, Erin relinquishes 3 lollipops to Ella, leading to a final count of 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin now possesses 14 lollipops.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the amount the customer paid, we must first calculate the total rewards they received. Given that the customer's loyalty card offers $1 off for every $20 spent, and they spent $80, we can calculate the rewards as follows:

Rewards = Total Spent / 20
Rewards = $80 / 20
Rewards = $4

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the actual rewards they received is 2 * Rewards = 2 * $4 = $8.

Now, subtract the actual rewards from the total amount they spent to find the amount they paid: 
Amount Paid = Total Spent - Actual Rewards
Amount Paid = $80 - $8
Amount Paid = $72

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must first calculate the annual income and tax for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay for each job, we find that Job B provides a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can employ a two-step process. First, we calculate the total number of ruined castles by finding 40% of the total number of castles in Scotland, which is 220. This can be achieved by multiplying 220 by 0.4.

Total ruined castles = 220 * 0.4 = 88

Next, we need to find half of the ruined castles, as the problem states that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of ruined castles by 2.

Unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of compound percentage change. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price after the first year. The initial price is $8, and it increases by 50%. This can be represented as:

New price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
New price = $8 + ($8 * 0.5)
New price = $8 + $4
New price = $12

Next, we calculate the decrease in the stock price after the second year. The new price is $12, and it decreases by 25%. This can be represented as:

New price = Old price - (Old price * Decrease percentage)
New price = $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
New price = $12 - $3
New price = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:

Total value = Number of shares * New price
Total value = 8 * $9
Total value = $72

Therefore, the final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we establish the number of hot dogs Thomas ate, which is three times the amount Luke consumed. Given that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Next, we calculate the number of hot dogs John ate, which is half the amount Thomas consumed. Therefore, John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To determine the total number of legs on the farm, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cows as x. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens can be represented as 2x.

The total number of animals is given as 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we obtain:

3x = 60

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 20

This implies that there are 20 cows and, consequently, 40 chickens.

To calculate the total number of legs, we can multiply the number of each type of animal by the respective number of legs it possesses. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

(20 cows * 4 legs) + (40 chickens * 2 legs) = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"

Josh initially juggled 3 balls and added 1 ball to his act each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls at the end of each week can be calculated as follows:

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh starts juggling on stage at the end of the fourth week, we can directly determine the number of balls he has. 

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we must first establish the weight of each animal. 

Given that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, and the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can conclude that the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog and the green toad weigh the same, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds. 

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. 

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself. The total weight is given by the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, minus the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird)
Total weight = 200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband. Her son consumes 4 cookies per day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband consumes 1 cookie per day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The combined total of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can employ the concept of percentage decrease. 

First, calculate the discount amount for one shirt: 40% of $30 is equivalent to 0.4 * $30 = $12. 

Subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt to obtain the discounted price: $30 - $12 = $18.

Since Davos purchased two shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2 to obtain the total cost: $18 * 2 = $36.

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the two shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we first need to calculate the revenue generated from tractors and silos separately.

The factory previously sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. In contrast, they now sell 5 silos at $220 each, yielding a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The total daily revenue has increased from $1000 to $1100, resulting in a difference of $100. To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure on food, treats, and medicine. 

The cost of food is $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the monthly expenditure on food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

The monthly expenditure on treats is given as $20, and the monthly expenditure on medicine is $100. 

The total monthly expenditure is the sum of these individual expenditures: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total duration of Peyton's after-work activities, we must first calculate the time allocated to each activity.

The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, which lasts one hour. Therefore, the cooking class on Tuesday lasts 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is 0.5 hours.

The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the museum tour on Thursday lasts 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Peyton's errands on Friday last for two hours.

Now, we can calculate the total duration of all activities by adding the individual times together: 1 (yoga) + 3 (cooking class) + 0.5 (cheese-tasting event) + 1.5 (museum tour) + 2 (errands) = 7.5 hours.

The total duration of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of pots required for the daisies and roses. Since the number of pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, we can express this as 2x, where x represents the number of pots required for the daisies. Therefore, the total number of pots required is 30 (for daisies) + 2x (for roses).

We are given that April had 100 plant pots initially. To find the number of pots she has left over, we can set up the equation: 100 - (30 + 2x) = number of pots left over.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 100 - 30 - 2x = number of pots left over
70 - 2x = number of pots left over

Since we know that April needs 30 pots for the daisies, we can substitute x = 30 into the equation: 
70 - 2(30) = number of pots left over
70 - 60 = number of pots left over
10 = number of pots left over

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. We start with the initial amount she had, which is $36. Then, we subtract the total amount she spent and gave away, which is $11 (for the sweater) and $4 (given to her brother), totaling $15.

$36 - $15 = $21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity. 

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as x. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. Additionally, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, for a total of 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities can be expressed as 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. This represents 30% of the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation 0.3x = 15 to find the total time spent on vacation.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle's earnings from her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, can be calculated as 20 hours * $10/hour = $200. Her earnings from her second job, where she earns $5 per hour, can be calculated as 15 hours * $5/hour = $75. The sum of these earnings is $200 + $75 = $275.

Adding her initial savings of $80 to this total, we obtain $275 + $80 = $355.

To find the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as x. Given that the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, its height can be expressed as x + 5. The combined height of the two shortest trees is then x + (x + 5) = 2x + 5.

The height of the tallest tree is stated to be twice the combined height of the two shortest trees. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2(2x + 5) to represent the height of the tallest tree.

Solving for x, we have:

2(2x + 5) = 4x + 10

Since the height of the tallest tree is given as 34 feet, we can equate 4x + 10 to 34 and solve for x:

4x + 10 = 34
4x = 24
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the tallest tree by substituting x into the expression 2(2x + 5):

2(2(6) + 5) = 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is indeed 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he purchased. The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12. The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After purchasing the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11. His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we must first calculate the total cost of the activities she desires. The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wishes to engage in this activity once. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she intends to ride twice, resulting in a total cost of $20. Additionally, she desires $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Given that Morgan's budget is $90, we can subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget to determine the remaining amount available for friend invitations. This yields $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will incur a cost of $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can calculate the number of friends she can invite by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days, we must first calculate the daily expenditure on lollipops and then subtract this amount from her daily pocket money.

Given that Marisa receives $5 as pocket money daily and purchases 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, we can calculate the daily expenditure on lollipops as follows:

Daily expenditure on lollipops = Number of lollipops purchased per day * Cost per lollipop
= 4 * $0.25
= $1

Since Marisa saves the change, we can calculate the daily savings as follows:

Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Daily expenditure on lollipops
= $5 - $1
= $4

To find the total savings over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days:

Total savings = Daily savings * Number of days
= $4 * 5
= $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days.

Final answer: $20"
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to establish the total amount of money Billy had initially. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, we can infer that the initial amount of money he had was twice the amount he spent on gumballs. Given that he spent $2 on gumballs, the initial amount of money he had is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, we can calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy. We know that he had $10 initially and $4 was spent on gumballs, so the amount spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

Now, we can determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound. The cost per pound of candy is $1.5, so the number of pounds of candy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to isolate the variable representing the son's age. Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as C.

Given that the father is 45 years old, we have C = 45. Additionally, we know that the father's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we obtain 45 = 2S - 5. To solve for S, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 50 = 2S. Dividing both sides by 2 yields S = 25.

Therefore, the son's age is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of days between train services, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a single trip. The train covers 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. This latter distance is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance of one trip is the sum of these three segments: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train completes this trip three times a day, the total distance covered in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total daily distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we can express this as a decimal. However, for practical purposes, we can round this value to a more interpretable form.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.0375}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing required, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. This can be achieved by taking the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds). The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

With this information, we can now calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the specified beds. Four chihuahua beds will require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. Three collie beds will require 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing required is the sum of the amounts needed for the chihuahua and collie beds, which is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total time taken for the trip, we can break down the journey into its constituent parts and calculate the time taken for each segment.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance to his friend's house and the distance back home, which is 200 miles + 240 miles = 440 miles. However, we must also account for the detour, which added 10 miles to the initial 200 miles, resulting in a total distance of 200 + 10 = 210 miles to his friend's house. The return trip is 240 miles.

The time taken to travel to his friend's house can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

The time taken to travel back home can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the time taken to travel to his friend's house and the time taken to travel back home, plus the time taken for the detour:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours + 0.14 hours
Total time = 6.14 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{6.14}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. We know that the total number of students is 96, and 43 of them are girls. This implies that the remaining students are boys.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

However, we are also given that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize the given information that there are twice as many boys as girls. This implies a direct proportionality between the number of boys and girls. 

Let's denote the number of girls as 'g' and the number of boys as 'b'. We are given that b = 2g. We also know that the total number of kids is the sum of boys and girls, which can be represented as b + g.

Substituting b = 2g into the equation, we get:

b + g = 2g + g
b + g = 3g

We are also given that the number of girls (g) is 6. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

b + 6 = 3(6)
b + 6 = 18
b = 12

Now that we have the number of boys, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = b + g
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the points she needs on the third test as x. The sum of the points from all three tests must be at least 42. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtracting 33 from both sides yields:

x ≥ 9

This indicates that Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we can start by calculating the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons. 

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Then, 4 times that number minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, which equals 7 customers. Additionally, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, resulting in 21 customers.

The total number of customers kicked out for these specific reasons is 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons from the overall total:

50 (total) - 31 (specific reasons) = 19

Therefore, 19 customers were kicked out for other reasons."
"To determine the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of points Sara had before scoring as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's points as 3x.

We are given that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we are dealing with whole numbers, we can round x to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 4.67 to 5, as Sara cannot have a fraction of a point.

Now, to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 5
Erin's points before = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we can break down the expenses into distinct components. 

First, we need to determine the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching. The total cost of the picture frames can be calculated as follows:

$20 (frame cost) * 1.20 (1 + 0.20 for etching) = $24 per frame
Total cost of picture frames = 44 frames * $24 per frame = $1056

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is:

2 pins * $5 per pin = $10

Additionally, we need to account for the cords required for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer requires a cord at a cost of $12, so the total cost of the cords is:

11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the senior gifts by adding up the individual costs:

$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1198."
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we must first calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of the original cost, which can be found by multiplying the original cost by 0.20.

Original cost = $400
Discount = 0.20 * $400 = $80

The total cost for the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the original cost.

Total cost for DIY = Original cost - Discount
Total cost for DIY = $400 - $80
Total cost for DIY = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of shoes sold each day and then accounting for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the amount from Friday, resulting in 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount from Saturday, which equates to 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six customers returned their shoes, so we must subtract these from the total. The corrected total is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44 pairs.

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the total hours for each day and then sum them up.

Hallie's practice schedule consists of 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, her practice lasts twice as long as her Tuesday class, which is 2 hours. Therefore, her Saturday practice is 2 x 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week can be calculated as follows:

Total hours = Tuesday hours + Thursday hours + Saturday hours
Total hours = 1 + 2 + 4
Total hours = 7

Therefore, Hallie has 7 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we must first calculate the number of faulty pieces and then subtract this value from the total number of pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as N. Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, we can express the number of faulty pieces as 0.4N. 

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the following equation:

Total amount spent = Number of functioning pieces * Price per piece

We know that the number of functioning pieces is N - 0.4N = 0.6N. However, we are not given the price per piece. 

To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we need more information about the price per piece. Assuming the price per piece is constant, we can express the total amount spent as:

Total amount spent = 0.6N * Price per piece

Since we are not given the price per piece, we cannot calculate the exact amount spent on functioning pieces. However, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces in terms of the price per piece:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6N * Price per piece

To provide a numerical answer, we would need to know the price per piece."
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects daily, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the milk yield from each half of her sheep and then summing the results.

Given that Mary has 30 sheep, we can divide this number by 2 to find the number of sheep in each half, which yields 15 sheep. 

The milk yield from the first half of the sheep is 1 kg per sheep, resulting in a total of 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk. 

Similarly, the milk yield from the second half of the sheep is 2 kg per sheep, yielding a total of 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

By summing the milk yields from both halves, we can determine the total amount of milk Mary collects daily, which is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we must consider the initial number of rolls and the subsequent division of the remaining rolls into smaller pieces.

Initially, Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls. After feeding 6 rolls to her children, she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. These remaining rolls were then divided into 8 equal pieces each. To calculate the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size: 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

Next, we find the number of remaining pupils: 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Then, we calculate the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils: 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

Finally, we find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into its constituent parts.

Given that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can sum the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Given that there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed can be calculated as 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total count. Initially, Rachel had 23 cookies. She then received an additional 42 cookies from Janet, bringing the total to 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

However, her brother subsequently consumed 44 cookies, resulting in a net reduction of 44 - 23 = 21 cookies. This means that the total number of cookies available to Rachel is now 65 - 21 = 44 cookies.

Therefore, Rachel has 44 cookies left.

Final answer: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can employ the formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan, which is given by:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount ($3,650)
r = monthly interest rate (10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333)
n = number of payments (5 months)

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 802.03

Therefore, Karan must pay approximately $802.03 per month.

The final answer is $802."
"To determine the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we can calculate their individual distances and then find the difference.

Cho's distance can be calculated as the product of her speed and the time she hiked: 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Similarly, Chloe's distance is found by multiplying her speed and the time she hiked: 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

The difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe can be determined by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we must first calculate the amount of silver and gold they possess individually.

Axel's silver pesos are 50, and Anna's silver pesos are twice Axel's, which is 2 * 50 = 100. Therefore, the total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.

Anna's gold pesos are 80, and she has 40 more than Axel's 80, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of their silver and gold pesos, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the profit per hour, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost. The total revenue is the product of the number of cups sold and the selling price per cup. Given that each pitcher holds 12 cups and Millie sells 3 pitchers, the total number of cups sold is 3 * 12 = 36 cups. Since each cup is sold for $1, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is the initial expenditure on supplies, which is $18.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit by the number of hours spent running the lemonade stand. Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours required to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can employ algebraic methods. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the remaining portion is 2/5, which equals 12.8 hectares. This can be expressed as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially possessed 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the total number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to establish the initial number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since the choir is performing with just the female members, the total number of individuals participating is solely comprised of these 26 girls. However, it is stated that half of the people performing cannot make it to the show due to a bus breakdown. This implies that the remaining individuals will be the ones performing.

To find the number of people who can perform, we need to calculate half of the total number of individuals participating. The total number of individuals participating is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we will round down to 14 individuals who can perform.

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 (girls) + 14 (performing individuals) = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we must calculate the arithmetic mean of his 5 test scores. This is achieved by summing the individual scores and then dividing by the total number of tests.

The sum of the scores is calculated as follows: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 5. This yields an average score of 400 / 5 = 80.

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

80"
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can employ the principles of arithmetic. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the erasers by multiplying the number of erasers (6) by the cost of one eraser ($2), resulting in a total of $12. 

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils by multiplying the number of pencils (8) by the cost of one pencil ($3), yielding a total of $24.

Finally, we add the total cost of the erasers and pencils together, which gives us $12 + $24 = $36.

The total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, which is 1/3 of the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson. 

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66 = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22 = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we must consider the cost of purchasing ride tickets versus a ride bracelet. 

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18. 

On the other hand, a ride bracelet costs $30 and grants access to 9 rides. 

Since David purchases a ride bracelet, he incurs no additional costs for tickets. 

Therefore, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we must first calculate the total number of gifts she needs to wrap. This can be achieved by summing the number of gifts for her family, friends, and teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Next, we divide the total amount of ribbon available by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift. This can be calculated as:

Total amount of ribbon ÷ Total number of gifts = 144 inches ÷ 12 gifts

Performing the division yields:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of popsicles each individual has, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/6. 

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we must first calculate the total cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim receives a 20% discount for bundling. To find the discounted cost, we calculate 20% of $10, which is $2. Subtracting this from the original cost yields a discounted cost of $10 - $2 = $8 per month for both Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The total cost of the streaming services is the sum of the individual costs: $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

In comparison, the cost of the cable package is $60 per month. To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42.

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the percentage of time spent editing, we must first convert the recording time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

The total work time can be calculated by summing the individual times spent on each activity: writing, recording, and editing. This yields a total of 4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100. This gives us (1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%.

Therefore, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the capacity of the shelving system. Given that it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity can be found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns, resulting in 6 x 6 = 36 books.

Next, we need to find double the capacity, which is 2 x 36 = 72 books. Finally, Wendy wants to place 20 more books than double the capacity, so we add 20 to the result, yielding 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now possesses, we must consider the initial number of cards she created, the cards she received from her father, and the cards she distributed to her classmates and family.

Initially, Erica crafted 20 cards. Her father presented her with 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. Therefore, she acquired 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her father.

Now, we calculate the total number of cards Erica possesses:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her father) = 50 cards

She distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, resulting in a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

To determine the current number of cards Erica possesses, we subtract the number of cards she distributed from the total number of cards she initially had:
50 - 29 = 21

Therefore, Erica now possesses 21 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices given away. 

Jenny's share of the pizza is 1/3 of 12 slices, which can be calculated as (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Similarly, Mark's share is 1/4 of 12 slices, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is the sum of Jenny's and Mark's shares, which is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Initially, Jenny had 12 slices. After giving away 7 slices, she is left with 12 - 7 = 5 slices. However, she also consumes 2 slices, resulting in a final count of 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can employ a simple division operation. The cost of the bike is $300, and Mark earns $10 per day. 

Dividing the cost of the bike by Mark's daily earnings yields:

$300 ÷ $10 = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to accumulate sufficient funds to purchase the bike."
"To determine the total number of bugs, we must first calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 the number of spiders, which is 1/3 * 90 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

The total number of bugs is the sum of the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we can express this as E = 30.

It is also stated that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so we can express Beth's age as B = E + 5. Substituting E = 30 into this equation yields B = 30 + 5 = 35.

Furthermore, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, which can be expressed as A = B + 7. Substituting B = 35 into this equation yields A = 35 + 7 = 42.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated as A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To determine the total calories consumed by John, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the total amount of milk consumed in ounces. Since John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass contains 8 ounces, the total ounces of milk consumed can be calculated as follows:

Total ounces = Number of glasses * Ounces per glass
Total ounces = 2 * 8
Total ounces = 16 ounces

Next, we can calculate the total calories consumed by multiplying the total ounces by the calories per ounce. Given that milk contains 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed can be calculated as:

Total calories = Total ounces * Calories per ounce
Total calories = 16 * 3
Total calories = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we must first calculate the total number of working days in a year. Given that the builder works 4 weeks per month and 6 days per week, we can calculate the total number of working days in a year as follows:

First, we multiply the number of weeks worked per month (4) by the number of weeks in a year (52), which yields 4 * 52 = 208 weeks. 

Since the builder works 6 days per week, we then multiply the total number of weeks worked in a year (208) by the number of working days per week (6), resulting in 208 * 6 = 1248 working days.

Finally, we multiply the total number of working days in a year (1248) by the daily wage ($50) to obtain the builder's annual earnings: 1248 * 50 = $62400.

The final answer is $62400."
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch. 

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Multiplying these quantities by 4 yields 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk, respectively. 

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we can calculate the number of bags needed by dividing the total amount of flour required (12 cups) by the volume of a single bag (2 cups), resulting in 6 bags. Similarly, the number of bottles of milk needed can be found by dividing the total amount of milk required (4 cups) by the volume of a single bottle (2 cups), yielding 2 bottles.

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by reducing the usage of a 900-watt air conditioner from 8 hours to 3 hours per day, we first need to calculate the total energy consumption in 30 days at both the original and reduced usage rates.

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts, which is equivalent to 0.9 kilowatts (kW). Therefore, the total energy usage in 30 days is:

Total energy usage in 30 days = 0.9 kW * 8 hours/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

After reducing the usage to 3 hours per day, the new energy usage per day is 0.9 kW * 3 hours/day = 2.7 kWh. The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate is:

Total energy usage in 30 days = 2.7 kWh * 3 hours/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage:

Energy saved per day = 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:

Total energy saved in 30 days = 135 kWh/day * 30 days = 4050 kWh

Therefore, Mel will save 4050 kWh of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4050}$"
"To determine the average number of stripes among the zebras, we must first calculate the total number of stripes. The first two zebras possess 17 stripes each, resulting in a combined total of 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is then calculated as the sum of the individual stripe counts: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

With four zebras in total, we can determine the average number of stripes by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes among the zebras is 22.

**The final answer is 22.**"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we must first establish the total quantity required for 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 individuals and there are 20 people in total, the number of sandwiches needed is 20 / 4 = 5.

Given that each sandwich necessitates 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total quantity of each is 5 pounds. The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound.

The total cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The total cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00."
"To determine the combined total of corns and cannolis, we first need to establish the initial quantities of each. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C and the number of corns as K. We are given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, so we can express this relationship as K = 2C.

We also know that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, so C = 40. Substituting this value into the equation K = 2C, we find that K = 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we are informed that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, resulting in a new total of 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. However, we must correct the statement regarding the number of corns; it should be 40 fewer corns than cannolis, not more. Therefore, the correct number of corns after the purchase is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we can calculate the combined total of corns and cannolis: 100 (cannolis) + 60 (corns) = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we must first calculate the total steps he completed prior to the jog. Since he finished half of his 10,000-step goal on his walks to and from school, we can calculate this as 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

Additionally, he completed an extra 1,000 steps during a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps remaining to reach his goal. To find the number of steps taken during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we must first calculate the total time required to complete the book. This can be achieved by dividing the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

The total number of words in the book is 45 pages, with each page containing 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. To find the time required to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Considering that it takes 10 minutes to travel to the airport, we can calculate the total time required to arrive at the airport by adding the time taken to read the book and the travel time: 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will arrive at the airport 60 minutes (required time) - 40 minutes (total time) = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we can break down the problem into two parts: May and June.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. This results in a total of 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 3/4 of the employees. The number of employees remaining is 3/4 * 40 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June, which is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The taffy, being on sale, can be considered as two separate items: one at the full price of $3 and the other at a discounted price of $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally also purchased a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, resulting in a total cost of 4 x $0.25 = $1. The combined cost of these items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally initially had $10. To find the amount of money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

$3"
"To determine the total amount spent by Tim, we must first calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package has a value of $400, while the second package is worth twice as much, resulting in a cost of 2 x $400 = $800. The combined cost of these two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to this total, which equates to 0.20 x $1200 = $240. Therefore, the discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages, we obtain a total expenditure of $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can employ a straightforward approach. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night and desires to sustain herself for 30 days, the total number of cookies required can be calculated as follows:

Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Given that her recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can then divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to obtain the number of dozens required:

Total dozens needed = Total cookies needed / 12
= 60 cookies / 12
= 5

Therefore, Shannon must prepare 5 dozens of cookies to meet her 30-day supply.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we must consider the intersection of the two events. We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we are also told that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. However, we are not provided with information about the percentage of candles that explode.

Let's denote the total number of candles as N = 50,000. The number of candles that smell like wet dog can be calculated as 5% of N:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = 0.05N = 0.05(50,000) = 2,500

Since these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% or 0.01. We can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, as there is no other information provided.

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode can be calculated as:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog and exploding = 0.05N = 0.05(50,000) = 2,500

Therefore, 2,500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

2,500"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of each blouse. The discount is 30% of the regular price, which is $20.

First, we calculate the discount amount per blouse:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price to obtain the discounted price per blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha selects 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses can be calculated as:

Total cost = Number of blouses * Discounted price per blouse
= 4 * $14
= $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which implies that her sister's total from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples.

Furthermore, we are informed that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, which can be expressed as the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the known values, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

Therefore, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, which translates to the equation:

c + d = 180

Additionally, we know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, resulting in a total of 304 bumps. This information allows us to form the equation:

2c + d = 304

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we can eliminate 'd' and solve for 'c':

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we have found 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down his journey into distinct segments.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day, resulting in a total distance of 800 kilometers. Over the subsequent 2 days, he covered 30% of the distance he traveled in the initial 4 days, which equates to 240 kilometers. Consequently, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, Tom did not travel, so the distance for this day is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day, resulting in a total distance of 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is the sum of the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week, which is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can establish a relationship between the locker sizes based on the given information. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

Given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as P = (1/4)Z. We are also given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so P = 5.

Substituting P = 5 into the equation, we get 5 = (1/4)Z. To solve for Z, we can multiply both sides by 4, yielding Z = 20.

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as T = (1/2)Z. Substituting Z = 20 into this equation, we get T = (1/2)(20) = 10.

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 10 cubic inches in size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the elevation of Stanley's comb, we can utilize the concept of relative elevation. Since the comb fell from Stanley's position at 10,000 feet, we can calculate the elevation of the comb by adding the distance it fell to Stanley's elevation.

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Stanley's elevation + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Now, to find the difference in elevation between the comb and Oliver's position, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation.

Difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Oliver's elevation
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11,000}$"
"To determine the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

We are given that he initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank provided $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $8000. 

To find the total capital, we add the initial amount to the amounts received from the two banks: $5000 + $4000 + $8000. 

This calculation yields a total capital of $14000."
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

First, we calculate the total number of cats removed by the boats. Since four boats each carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats removed is 4 * 5 = 20.

Next, we subtract the number of cats removed from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Then, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats, which is (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break down the subscription into three distinct periods. 

The initial 6 months are charged at a rate of $8 per month, resulting in a total of $8 * 6 = $48. Following this, the subscription increases to the standard rate of $12 per month for the subsequent 8 months, yielding a total of $12 * 8 = $96. Finally, the subscription is elevated to $14 per month for the final 8 months, resulting in a total of $14 * 8 = $112.

The cumulative cost for the entire 2-year period can be calculated by summing the costs of these three periods: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To determine the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we can approach the problem by first establishing the price of the jogger jeans. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans can be expressed as x + 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of this amount came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. This can be represented as:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * x + 4 = 6

Combining like terms yields:

1 * x + 4 = 6

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we have determined the original price of the jogger jeans to be $2, we can calculate the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total capacity of the vehicles, we can calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

The capacity of the buses can be calculated by multiplying the number of buses by the capacity of each bus: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

Similarly, the capacity of the minibusses can be calculated by multiplying the number of minibusses by the capacity of each minibus: 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

Lastly, the capacity of the minivans can be calculated by multiplying the number of minivans by the capacity of each minivan: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we can sum up the capacities of all vehicles to find the total capacity: 240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we must first establish the bird-attracting capacity of each type of feeder. The store-bought feeders, which serve as the baseline, attract 20 birds each. Given that Lillian purchased 3 of these feeders, the total number of birds they attract can be calculated as 3 * 20 = 60.

In contrast, the homemade feeders, which exhibit a higher bird-attracting capacity, each attract 30 birds. Since Lillian constructed 3 of these feeders, the total number of birds they attract is 3 * 30 = 90.

To obtain the overall bird population, we must sum the bird-attracting capacities of both the store-bought and homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the soup, which is 25% more than the cost of the bagel. This can be expressed as:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (25% of Cost of bagel)
= $4 + (0.25 * $4)
= $4 + $1
= $5

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake, which is half the price of the bagel:

Cost of cake = (1/2) * Cost of bagel
= (1/2) * $4
= $2

Now, we can calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner by adding the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner.

The final answer is $11."
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny possessed, we can employ algebraic techniques to solve the problem. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Given that he sells 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sells is (1/3)x. Since each card is sold for $1.5, the total amount of money he generates from selling the cards is 1.5 * (1/3)x = 0.5x.

It is stated that Kenny has $50 in spending cash, which implies that the amount he made from selling the cards is $50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.5x = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 * 2
x = 100

Thus, Kenny initially possessed 100 Pokémon cards."
"To address the problem, we can approach it from a supply and demand perspective. The caterer initially prepared hotdogs for half of the guests to have two, which equates to 18 guests. However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. 

Given that the caterer had prepared enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two, we can infer that the total number of hotdogs available is sufficient to meet the demand of 40 guests. 

Since 18 guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are those who were not initially prepared for two hotdogs. 

To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests initially prepared for two hotdogs from the total number of guests who showed up:

40 (total guests) - 18 (initially prepared for two hotdogs) = 22

Therefore, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. 

Since Indras' name has 6 letters, we find half of this value by dividing 6 by 2, which equals 3. 

Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3, resulting in 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: 

- The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
- The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
- The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is the sum of these individual costs: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount on the total cost. This can be done by multiplying the total cost by 0.20, which yields $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to obtain the final amount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora still needs to acquire the desired items, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The sum of the costs of the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora's current financial situation can be analyzed by adding the $2 she has saved from her allowance to the $16 provided by her mother, yielding a total of $18.

To find the amount of money Dora still requires, we subtract the amount she currently possesses from the total cost of the items: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to acquire the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information provided step by step.

First, we establish the number of dragons slain by each of the other princes. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Since Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, we can calculate his total as 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, we find the number of dragons Prince Walter slew, which is twice the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew. Therefore, Prince Walter's total is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, we calculate the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, which is one-fifth of the number of dragons Prince Walter slew. This can be found by dividing Prince Walter's total by 5, resulting in 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we must first calculate the volume of a single container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, the volume of a single container is:

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is equivalent to:

1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 0.75 gallons to pints as follows:

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we can begin by calculating the total amount of money he spent on chips. Given that each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he acquired 3 bags, the total expenditure on chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

Since George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount he spent on candy bars. The amount spent on candy bars is 99% of the total, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we can find the amount spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of chips from the total amount spent: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Given that each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can determine the number of candy bars purchased by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we can employ a straightforward division approach. 

First, we calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Ray set aside 5 for himself. This is done by subtracting the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he initially had.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Next, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends to determine the number of lollipops each friend received.

Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Given that the cake is divided into 8 equal pieces and 2 of them are consumed, we can calculate the weight of the remaining cake as follows:

Total weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of pieces consumed = 2

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the consumed pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of individuals involved in the sharing process. This can be achieved by adding the number of oranges Sitti and Juris possess to the number of their friends.

Total individuals = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges + their friends
Total individuals = 34 + 22 + 6
Total individuals = 62

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of individuals to determine the number of oranges each person will receive.

Number of oranges per person = Total oranges / Total individuals
Number of oranges per person = 56 / 62
Number of oranges per person = 0.903

Since we cannot divide oranges into fractions, we can round down to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone receives a whole orange. Therefore, each person will receive 0 oranges.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound, resulting in a total cost of $4.00. Additionally, Antoine requires 2 boxes of beef stock, each priced at $2.00, contributing an extra $4.00 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Given that Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of servings. This yields $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine the optimal departure time for Bernadette, we must first establish the time it takes for each individual to reach the theater. Given that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to arrive at the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater as 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette aims to arrive 5 minutes prior to Wayne, we can calculate the time difference in their departure times as 16 - 5 = 11 minutes. Therefore, Bernadette should depart 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first convert the length from yards to feet, as the area is given in square feet. Since 1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Given the area of the room is 360 square feet, we can utilize the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = L * W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width, we obtain W = A / L.

Substituting the given values, we have W = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula P = 2 * (L + W), where P is the perimeter.

P = 2 * (9 + 40)
P = 2 * 49
P = 98 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each one acquired.

Elizabeth's total beads can be calculated as the sum of the beads from the red and clear packs she purchased. Since each pack contains 20 beads, her total is 1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 41 beads.

Margareth's total beads can be calculated as the sum of the beads from the blue and red packs she purchased. Since each pack contains 20 beads, her total is 3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 83 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters can be found by subtracting Elizabeth's total from Margareth's total: 83 - 41 = 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the cumulative effects of both the heating and cooling processes.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. During the 3-hour baking period, the oven's temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, resulting in a total temperature increase of 15 degrees. Therefore, the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

However, the house's temperature is further affected by the 30-minute window opening. The cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, which translates to 0.2 degrees per minute. Over the 30-minute period, the temperature decreases by 0.2 * 30 = 6 degrees. Consequently, the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' run time, we must first calculate the total time taken by Jon and James for each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James' swim time is 10% faster, which can be calculated as 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, and James' bike time is 5 minutes longer, resulting in 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes, and we will denote James' run time as x.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time taken by Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. This can be expressed as:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

170 = 111 + x

Subtracting 111 from both sides yields:

59 = x

Therefore, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can start by establishing the length of Movie C in minutes. Given that Movie C is 1.25 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we are informed that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B can be calculated as follows:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can determine the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Given that the horse's speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 0.5 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay consumed is:

8 bails (since 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails)

The cost of the hay is calculated as:

Cost = Number of bails * Price per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to a total of:

Total amount = 6 * $5
Total amount = $30

The change Michael receives after purchasing the hay is:

Change = Total amount - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equate to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs, bringing the total to 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, and each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the capacity of each tray is 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

To find the maximum number of trays Rozanne can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray: 50 / 25 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers. The salesman initially sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, resulting in a revenue of 17 * $20 = $340. The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store at $25 each, yielding a revenue of 31 * $25 = $775. The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts, which equals $340 + $775 = $1115.

The total cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of colors in each type of packet and then summing them together.

We are given that six packets contain 8 colors each, and four packets contain 16 colors each. To find the total number of colors, we can calculate the product of the number of packets and the number of colors in each type of packet, and then sum these values.

For the six packets with 8 colors each, the total number of colors is 6 × 8 = 48.

For the four packets with 16 colors each, the total number of colors is 4 × 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as P and the cost of the soda as S.

We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda. The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, and the cost of the soda is $3. We are also given that the total cost without the super ticket is $18, which is the cost of the movie ticket plus the cost of the popcorn and soda.

We can set up the following equation:

$12 + P + S = $18

We are also given that the cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda, and the cost of the soda is $3. The cost of the popcorn is $5 (as calculated earlier). We can set up another equation:

$12 + $5 + $3 = $20

However, this equation is not necessary to solve for P. We can use the first equation to solve for P:

$12 + P + S = $18

We know that the cost of the soda is $3, so we can substitute S = $3 into the equation:

$12 + P + $3 = $18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 + P = $18

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

P = $3

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we must first establish the new cost per balloon. The initial cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, and the price of each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

$900 / 20 = $45 (original cost per balloon)
$45 + $20 = $65 (new cost per balloon)

Now, we can calculate the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:

170 balloons * $65 per balloon = $11,050

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car's speed is comprised of two segments: 60 mph for 2 hours and 30 mph for 1 hour. We can calculate the distance traveled during each segment using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

For the first segment, the distance traveled is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles. For the second segment, the distance traveled is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the times for each segment: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is then calculated as the total distance divided by the total time: Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she has retained and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna possesses 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 of them. Consequently, she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she retains is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna receives 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. Therefore, the value of the rubies she receives is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies, which is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will consume a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we must first calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the raised beds, is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

In this case, the dimensions of each bed are 8 feet (length), 2 feet (width), and 2 feet (height). Therefore, the volume of one bed is V = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, and the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 x $12 = $1920.

Therefore, the total cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920.

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies. This can be achieved by adding the number of puppies from Jennifer's dog (8) to the number of puppies from Brandon's dog (12), resulting in a total of 20 puppies.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Since Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

To calculate the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100. This gives us (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35\%}$"
"To determine the number of trips required to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the various feed items. This can be achieved by summing the weights of each item: 

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds in total.
- 4 bags of carrots weigh 48 pounds in total.
- 42 bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds in total.
- 20 sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds in total.

The total weight of the feed is then 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

Given that the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can calculate the number of trips required by dividing the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we must first calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately. 

The value of an aluminum can is 2 cents, and Grayson consumes 3 cans per week. Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans can be calculated as 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Similarly, the value of a plastic bottle is 3 cents, and Grayson consumes 5 bottles per week. Thus, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles can be calculated as 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

The total weekly earnings can be obtained by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles, which is 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Grayson's monthly earnings can be calculated as 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

"To determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in two months, which is 1/5 of the total pencils: (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

The remaining pencils after two months can be found by subtracting the used pencils from the initial total: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils: (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we can establish a linear relationship between the number of carrot sticks and the number of cookies he consumes. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as x. According to the given information, Matt's cookie consumption is directly proportional to the number of carrot sticks, with a constant of proportionality of 1/2. Additionally, he receives 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is 5. We can express this as an equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to satisfy his cookie craving.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we must first convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equivalent to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is then 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of students at the grade level, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Let's denote the total number of students as x. Since three-fourths of the students possess a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

Conversely, the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x. We are given that this quantity equals 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation (1/4)x = 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, yielding x = 20 * 4 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of students at the grade level is 80.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can employ the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both. This is represented by the formula:

Total allergic = (Dairy + Peanuts) - Both

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total allergic = (9 + 6) - 3
Total allergic = 15 - 3
Total allergic = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:

Number not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic
Number not allergic = 32 - 12
Number not allergic = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of individuals participating in the tour, we must consider the number of employees and the number of tour guides. The company has divided its employees into 3 groups, with each group consisting of 200 employees. Additionally, there are 7 tour guides assigned to each group.

The total number of employees can be calculated by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees in each group: 3 * 200 = 600.

The total number of individuals participating in the tour, including the tour guides, is the sum of the total number of employees and the number of tour guides: 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607.

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 607."
"To determine the total cost of the anniversary getaway, we must first calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel separately.

The cost of the plane tickets can be found by multiplying the cost per ticket ($5000) by the number of tickets (2), resulting in a total of $10,000.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. Given that the hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day, we can find the increased cost by multiplying the normal price by 0.2, which equals $300. Adding this to the normal price yields a daily cost of $1800. Since the couple will be staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Finally, we can determine the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we can analyze the information provided. We know that Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 

Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we can calculate the number of blue tubes he has by dividing Ben's blue tubes by 2. This results in 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Furthermore, Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so we can calculate the number of yellow tubes he has by multiplying Ben's yellow tubes by 3. This yields 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Combining these results, we find that Jasper has a total of 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is 11."
"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we can start by finding the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Since the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the amount still required to reach their goal, we must first calculate the total earnings of Keegan and Tashay. This can be achieved by adding their individual earnings, which yields $83 + $91 = $174.

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his portable media player, we first need to establish the number of songs he currently possesses. Given that Luri has three times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate Luri's current song count as follows:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Next, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player, considering its maximum capacity of 100 songs. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity:

Gabriel's additional songs = Maximum capacity - Gabriel's songs
Gabriel's additional songs = 100 - 20
Gabriel's additional songs = 80

Finally, to determine how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

Difference in additional songs = Gabriel's additional songs - Luri's songs
Difference in additional songs = 80 - 60
Difference in additional songs = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we can employ the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that he gave up $10 for each orange and he consumed 2/5 of the total oranges picked, we can calculate the total amount by multiplying the proportion of oranges consumed by the amount given up per orange.

Let's denote the total amount of money given up as 'x'. We can set up the following proportion:

(2/5) * 60 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

(2/5) * 10 = 60
2 * 10 = 60 * 5/2
20 = 150/2
20 = 75

Now, we can multiply both sides by 10 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 10
x = 200

Therefore, Stetson gave up a total of $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. According to the problem, the cost of her handbag is $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are given that her shoes cost $80, so we can substitute s = 80 into the equation:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs per week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we multiply the number of miles he runs per day (12 miles) by the number of days he runs per week (5 days) to obtain the total miles run per week. This yields 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Next, we divide the total miles run per week (60 miles) by the miles run per hour (10 miles/hour) to calculate the total hours run per week. This results in 60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours per week.

"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we can calculate the average height of the girls and then multiply it by the number of girls in each layer.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, the average height of these girls is 64 inches. However, we must account for the 10th girl, who is 60 inches tall. To find the average height of all 10 girls, we can use the weighted average formula:

(9 * 64) + 60 = 576 + 60 = 636

Divide the total by 10 to find the average height of all 10 girls:
636 / 10 = 63.6 inches

Now, we can calculate the total height of the human pyramid by multiplying the average height by the number of girls in each layer and adding them together:

Bottom layer: 4 girls * 63.6 inches = 253.6 inches
Middle layer: 3 girls * 63.6 inches = 190.8 inches
Top layer: 2 girls * 63.6 inches = 127.2 inches
Shortest girl: 60 inches

Adding the heights of all layers together:
253.6 + 190.8 + 127.2 + 60 = 591.6 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12:
591.6 / 12 = 49.4 feet

"To determine the break-even point for the two venues, we can set up an equation based on the costs associated with each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The total cost of the first venue consists of a flat fee of $200 and an additional $5 per guest for food, resulting in a total cost of 200 + 5x.

In contrast, the second venue charges a per-guest fee of $25, which includes the cost of food. Therefore, the total cost of the second venue can be represented as 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we equate the two expressions:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

x = 10

Therefore, the break-even point occurs when 10 guests are present.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express this as z = y + 7. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, which can be represented as y = x/2.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation x + y + z = 43.

Substituting y = x/2 into the first two equations, we get:

z = x/2 + 7
y = x/2

Substituting these expressions into the total equation, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found by substituting x into the equation z = x/2 + 7:

z = 18/2 + 7
z = 9 + 7
z = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as F and the number of sheep on the farm as S, and the number of cows on the zoo as Z and the number of sheep on the zoo as W.

We are given the following information:
1. The farm has 30 cows, so F = 30.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so Z = 2F.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so S = W/2.
4. The zoo has 20 sheep, so W = 20.

We can substitute the values of F and W into the equations to find the number of sheep on the farm (S) and the number of cows on the zoo (Z).

Since F = 30, we can find Z by multiplying F by 2: Z = 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we can find S by dividing W by 2: S = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we can add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Number of days
= 105,000 calories / 183 days
≈ 576 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories per day to reach his weight loss goal."
"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

Gerald's daily wage is $30, and he worked for a total of 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as 30 * 7 = $210.

However, he incurred an expenditure of $100. To find his remaining balance, we subtract the expenditure from his total earnings: $210 - $100 = $110.

Thus, Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. Given that she needs 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer and is required to run 8 laps, with each lap covering a distance of 0.25 kilometers, we can calculate the total water requirement as follows:

Total water needed = Number of laps * Water needed per kilometer
Total water needed = 8 * 60
Total water needed = 480 milliliters

Therefore, Hannah will need 480 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the amount spent on clothes, which is 20% of the initial $500. This can be expressed as 0.20 * $500 = $100. 

Subsequently, we subtract this amount from the initial $500 to obtain the remaining balance: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining $400. This can be calculated as 0.25 * $400 = $100.

Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining balance: $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the cost of the house, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express this relationship as a ratio: house cost : lot cost = 3 : 1. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Now that we have found the cost of the lot (x), we can determine the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:
House cost = 3x
House cost = 3 * 30,000
House cost = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To determine the profit earned by Tara, we must first calculate the total cost and total revenue associated with the sale of the canvas bags.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 8 packs * $4 per pack = $32.

Next, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of bags by the selling price per bag: 8 bags * $8 per bag = $64.

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $64 - $32 = $32.

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $32 on her canvas bags."
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we can employ the concept of unitary method. We know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute and the fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. 

First, we calculate the total number of minutes in the fight: 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Next, we multiply the number of punches Joe throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight: 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches during the fight.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. We are told that Suzanne made 36 cookies, and Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. This implies that Josh's cookie production is directly proportional to Suzanne's, with a ratio of 1:4.

Mathematically, we can express this relationship as:

Josh's cookies = (1/4) * Suzanne's cookies
Josh's cookies = (1/4) * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Given that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookie production as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he initially possesses. This can be found by adding the value of the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which amounts to 4 x $10 = $40. Additionally, he has 6 $20 bills, contributing 6 x $20 = $120 to his total savings. Therefore, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, we need to find the amount of money Ali gives to his sister. Since he gives her half of the total money, we can calculate this as $160 / 2 = $80.

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half of the total is $160 - $80 = $80.

Finally, we need to determine the amount of money Ali spends on dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining amount, which can be calculated as (3/5) x $80 = $48.

To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the cost of dinner from the remaining amount: $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we must first establish the time it takes Rob to accomplish this task. Given that Rob takes 2 hours, we convert this to minutes for consistency.

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Royce by doubling the time it takes Rob and adding 40 minutes.

Time it takes Royce = 2 * 120 minutes + 40 minutes
= 240 minutes + 40 minutes
= 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool required, we must first calculate the total number of items for the triplets. Since there are three grandchildren, and each requires a hat, scarf, sweater, pair of mittens, and pair of socks, the total number of items is 3 x 5 = 15.

Next, we must calculate the total number of skeins required for each item. The number of skeins needed for each item is as follows:
- Hats: 2 skeins per hat
- Scarves: 4 skeins per scarf
- Sweaters: 12 skeins per sweater
- Pairs of mittens: 1 skein per pair
- Pairs of socks: 2 skeins per pair

Now, we can calculate the total number of skeins required by multiplying the number of items by the number of skeins required for each item:
- Hats: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins
- Scarves: 15 x 4 = 60 skeins
- Sweaters: 15 x 12 = 180 skeins
- Pairs of mittens: 15 x 1 = 15 skeins
- Pairs of socks: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins

The total number of skeins required is the sum of the skeins needed for each item: 30 + 60 + 180 + 15 + 30 = 315.

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the total number of problems completed by Chris on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems, and on Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. The total problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Next, we calculate the remaining problems by subtracting the total problems completed from the total number of problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems. To find the number of problems left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems: 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of quarts Tony can pick per hour as T, Bobby as B, Kathy as K, and Ricky as R. We are given the following relationships:

T = 6
B = T - 1
K = 2B
R = K - 2

We can substitute the expressions for B and K in terms of T into the equation for R:

R = (T - 1) - 2
R = T - 3

Now, we can express the total number of quarts that can be picked per hour as the sum of the individual amounts:

Total = T + B + K + R
Total = T + (T - 1) + 2(T - 1) + (T - 3)
Total = 5T - 6

Substituting the value of T, we get:

Total = 5(6) - 6
Total = 30 - 6
Total = 24

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 24.

The final answer is 24."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we must consider the total number of loaves initially baked, the number sold, and the number returned. 

The total number of loaves initially baked is 200. The bakery sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. However, 6 loaves were returned, so the net number of loaves sold is 132 - 6 = 126. 

To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the net number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves initially baked: 200 - 126 = 74.

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine the total number of rows Jackson can plant, we need to consider the limiting factor, which is the color of tulip that results in the smallest number of rows. 

We can calculate the number of rows for each color of tulip as follows:

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the blue tulips result in fewer rows, we can conclude that Jackson will plant 3 rows of flowers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we must first recognize that the raisins will be divided equally among three distinct products: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. This implies that the total amount of raisins will be divided by 3.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies = 3/4 cup

To find the number of batches of oatmeal cookies, we can set up a proportion:

(3/4) / x = 27 / (3 + 1 + 1)
(3/4) / x = 27 / 5
x = (3/4) * 5
x = 15/4
x = 3.75

Since we cannot have a fraction of a batch, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Heather can make 3 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her original and new weekly energy consumption.

The original daily energy consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, which translates to 12 kWh/day. Multiplying this by 7 days yields an original weekly energy consumption of 12 kWh/day * 7 days = 84 kWh. Given that the cost of 1 kWh is $1.50, the original weekly bill can be calculated as 84 kWh * $1.50 = $126.

The new device will consume an additional 2 kilowatts per hour, bringing the new daily energy consumption to 12 kWh/day + 2 kWh/day = 14 kWh/day. Consequently, the new weekly energy consumption is 14 kWh/day * 7 days = 98 kWh. The new weekly bill can be calculated as 98 kWh * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can employ the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task.

Let's denote the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as 't' days. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can establish the equation:

1/2 * t = 5

Solving for 't', we find that t = 10 days.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house can be calculated using the inverse proportionality relationship:

Time taken by 5 people = (1/5) * Time taken by 1 person
= (1/5) * 10
= 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the total number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna's chair count can be expressed as 3x.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This relationship can be represented by the equation:

20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we find:

x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Thus, Ophelia has 22 chairs. Given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna's chair count is 3 * 22 = 66.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent on the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount paid: $48 - $4 = $44. This represents the cost of the headphone set.

Next, we divide the remaining amount ($44) by the cost of a single CD ($4) to find the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought: $44 ÷ $4 = 11.

Therefore, Tom could have purchased 11 additional CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.

The final answer is 11."
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we must consider the varying hours he worked during that period. 

Josh worked 4 hours per week for 5 weeks, which amounts to 4 * 5 = 20 hours. Additionally, he worked 5 hours for one week and 6 hours for another week. 

The total hours worked can be calculated by adding these values: 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 31 hours."
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, we have 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers disembark, resulting in 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining. 

Subsequently, 5 times the number of passengers who disembarked (8) board the bus, yielding 5 * 8 = 40 additional passengers. Consequently, the total number of passengers on the bus is now 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers disembark, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers on the bus. Notably, 3 times fewer passengers board the bus compared to the number who disembarked (21), which equates to 3 * 21 = 63 passengers. Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to establish an equation representing the given information. Let's denote Jame's current age as x.

In 5 years, Jame's age will be x + 5. In 8 years, his cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as:

(x + 5) + 8 = 2[(x + 5) - 5] + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

Therefore, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, to find the age difference between Jame and his cousin, we can calculate Jame's cousin's age in 8 years and subtract Jame's age from it. Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 8 + 13 = 21 years. The age difference is then 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the cost of the printer by subtracting $400 from the cost of the computer, which is $1,100. This yields a printer cost of $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we subtract the combined cost of the computer and printer from the total expenditure to isolate the cost of the monitors. The total expenditure is $2,400, so $2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600.

Since there are two monitors, we divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. Therefore, $600 / 2 = $300.

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can start by establishing the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as:

Number of seashells brought by girls = Number of seashells brought by boys + 4 * Number of seashells brought by boys

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by the boys as B. Since there are 10 boys, B = 60. 

Number of seashells brought by girls = 60 + 4 * 60
= 60 + 240
= 300

Now, to find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by girls by the number of girls:

Number of seashells brought by each girl = Total number of seashells brought by girls / Number of girls
= 300 / 10
= 30

Therefore, each girl brought 30 seashells."
"To determine the number of candies Nick had initially, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had as 'N' and the number of candies George had as 'G'. We are given that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can express this relationship as N = 2G.

We also know that George had 8 candies before eating 5, as calculated by adding the 5 candies he ate to the 3 he had left. Therefore, G = 8.

Substituting G = 8 into the equation N = 2G, we find that N = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information. We know that Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. This implies that Alyana's age can be calculated as 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Furthermore, it is stated that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, Anne's age can be determined by adding 2 to Alyana's age, resulting in 6 + 2 = 8 years.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book and sum them up.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to create to meet her monthly target, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of vlogs she has already produced: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

Next, we subtract this total from her desired monthly output: 72 (monthly target) - 54 (total vlogs made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma needs to create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly target.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount paid, we must first calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be achieved by multiplying the bill amount by 0.20, which yields $10. 

The total amount paid is then the sum of the original bill and the calculated tip: $50 + $10 = $60.

The final amount paid is $60."
"To determine the total amount the eldest boy has now, we can break down the problem into several steps.

Initially, the $18 is divided among 3 boys, resulting in each boy receiving $18 / 3 = $6. 

The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share, increasing his total to $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

After spending $8 from his total, he is left with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending $8, resulting in 3 * $13 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we can approach the problem by first calculating the total savings required for the second half of the month. Given that Elvis has a monthly target of $1125 and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the target for the second half of the month:

$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis aims to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can establish a relationship between the daily savings in the two halves. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as x. Consequently, the daily savings in the second half would be 2x.

The total savings in the first half of the month can be represented as 15x (since there are 15 days in the first half), and the total savings in the second half can be represented as 15(2x). Equating these two expressions, we get:

15x = 15(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we find that x = $562.50. However, this value represents the daily savings in the first half, not the second half. To find the daily savings in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * $562.50
2x = $1125

Since Elvis needs to save $1125 per day in the second half of the month, we can calculate the number of days in the second half as follows:

$1125 / $1125 = 1

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to divide the total savings for the second half by the number of days in the second half, which is 15. 

$1125 / 15 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the change Verna received, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruit items she purchased. 

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. 
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. 
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruit items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, his total earnings can be calculated as 20 * 0.8 = $16.

Similarly, Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, her total earnings can be calculated as 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the amount of money Jeff receives, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Given that Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, which is $100, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we obtain:

5x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since Jeff's share is four times that of Brad, we can calculate Jeff's share as 4x:

Jeff's share = 4 * 20
Jeff's share = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80."
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we must consider the round-trip distance to his workplace. Given that the distance from his residence to the workplace is 3 miles, the total daily round-trip distance is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, the total miles he walks in a week can be calculated by multiplying the daily round-trip distance by the number of working days: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down her writing process into distinct segments and calculate the total number of letters in each segment.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters. Since she repeats this process, the total number of letters in this segment is 26 * 2 = 52.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which comprises 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters). Therefore, the total number of letters in this segment is 52 + 13 = 65.

To find the overall total, we add the number of letters in each segment: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To determine the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we can model this situation using a geometric progression. 

In the first round, Ali initiates contact with 3 families. In the subsequent rounds, each family from the previous round serves as a node, and each node branches out to 3 other families. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.

The number of families notified in each round can be represented as follows:

Round 1: 3
Round 2: 3 * 3 = 9
Round 3: 9 * 3 = 27
Round 4: 27 * 3 = 81

Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is 81."
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of linear decline. Given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 consecutive months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. The total weight lost is the product of the monthly weight loss and the number of months, which is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

We can set up the equation: x - 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70 + 30
x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently possesses, we must first establish the target number of toys required for a play set five times larger than James's. Given that James's play set comprises 80 toys, a set five times larger would have a total of 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan requires 2 additional toys to achieve this target, we can calculate the number of toys he currently has by adding 2 to the desired total: 400 + 2 = 402.

Therefore, Jonathan currently possesses 402 toys."
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks can be calculated as 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

The total cost of all items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.
The discount amount is $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel must spend $27 on all the items he wants to purchase.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the amount of change Carly receives, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each item by its respective unit price and then summing the results.

The cost of hamburgers is 5 units * $4 per unit = $20.
The cost of potato fries is 10 units * $0.30 per unit = $3.
The cost of fruit drinks is 5 units * $2 per unit = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill Carly paid with: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly receives $17 as change.

$17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we can break down her commission into two components: the base commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales exceeding $1000.

The base commission for sales up to $1000 can be calculated as 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales exceeding $1000, the additional commission is 10% of the amount above $1000. This can be calculated as 10% of ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two components: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of bottles he already possesses. Since he has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we must calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. With 70 guests and a desire for 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find the number of additional bottles Bill needs to acquire, we subtract the number of bottles he already possesses from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we first need to establish the time it takes for Ray to swim 1 mile in each condition.

Let's denote the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day as $t_c$ and on a hot day as $t_h$. We are given that $t_c = 16$ minutes. The problem states that on a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. This relationship can be expressed as:

$t_h = 2t_c + 2$

Substituting the given value of $t_c$, we get:

$t_h = 2(16) + 2 = 34$ minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on each day:

Time on a cold day: $3t_c = 3(16) = 48$ minutes

Time on a hot day: $3t_h = 3(34) = 102$ minutes

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:

$102 - 48 = 54$ minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate John's weekly earnings, which can be obtained by multiplying his hourly wage ($2) by the number of hours he works in a day (5) and then by the number of days he works in a week (4). This yields a weekly income of $40.

Next, we divide the target savings amount ($80) by the weekly income ($40) to obtain the number of weeks required to achieve this goal. 

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we can break down the problem into two parts. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub. 

Since thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40 * 3 = $120, the total cost for both subs can be calculated by adding the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Total cost = $40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the total cost for lunch is $160."
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in each category of buttons and then summing them up.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x'. Since there are 7 buttons with two holes, we can express this as x = 7. The total number of buttons with four holes can be represented as 21 - x, which is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with two holes is 2x, and the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 4(21 - x). By combining these, we get the total number of holes as 2x + 4(21 - x).

Substituting x = 7 into the equation, we get 2(7) + 4(21 - 7) = 14 + 4(14) = 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given relationships between the locker sizes. 

First, we establish the size of Zack's locker as half that of Timothy's locker. Given that Timothy's locker measures 24 cubic inches, Zack's locker size can be calculated as:

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we're informed that Peter's locker is 1/4 as large as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4:

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker measures 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, her consumption is 0.5 cups. Given that Juan's consumption is 10 times that of Octavia's, his current intake is 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The recommended daily intake is 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from Juan's current intake: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

The answer is 1."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the concept of combinatorics. Specifically, we can leverage the multiplication principle, which states that if one event can occur in 'm' ways and a second independent event can occur in 'n' ways, then the events together can occur in m * n ways.

In this scenario, we have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we can calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To determine the average weight of the three individuals, we must first establish their respective weights. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, her weight can be calculated as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Furthermore, Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, resulting in 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight, we sum the weights of the three individuals and divide by 3. This yields (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. The sun's movement is described as a linear motion, where it moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Given that the initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees from the ground, we can calculate the total angle after 10 hours by adding the sun's movement to the initial angle. 

The total angle = initial angle + (sun's movement * time) 
= 32 degrees + (5 degrees/hour * 10 hours) 
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees 
= 82 degrees 

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees."
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, resulting in a total of 4 candles.

Given that a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs required by dividing the total number of candles needed by 5. 

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles to meet the demand.

The cost of 1 pack of 5 candles is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of pages she read in the first week and then adding the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to calculate the total minutes Judy spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she spent reading in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total minutes into pages. Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total minutes by 1.5 and multiplying by 2. This gives us:

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

Now, we are given that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week:

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 170 pages in two weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total portion of sandwiches consumed by Cody and Trevor.

Cody consumed 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 4 sandwiches. Trevor consumed 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 3 sandwiches. 

The total number of sandwiches consumed is the sum of the portions eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the initial total. 

12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

Given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, we have S = 44. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

N = 10

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the process into distinct stages.

Initially, the tooth fairy provided Sharon with $5.00 for the first tooth. This establishes a baseline value.

For the subsequent three teeth, the tooth fairy offered Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

In the final stage, the tooth fairy provided Sharon with half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Given that the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy offered Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth, yielding a total of 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

To calculate the overall amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we sum the values from each stage: $5.00 (initial payment) + $3.00 (payment for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (payment for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, which can be expressed as:
R = M + 20

Additionally, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be written as:
R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we find:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the second equation to find A:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

With the values of M and A determined, we can now calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate the total amount each individual made by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price of each lemonade.

Let's denote the number of lemonades sold by Mitchell as 'm' and the price of each lemonade as 'p'. We are given that m = 21 and p = $4. 

The total amount Mitchell made is given by the product of the number of lemonades sold and the price of each lemonade: m * p = 21 * 4 = $84.

Liam's earnings are given as $63. To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: $84 - $63 = $21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down his expenditure into two categories: wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter has $70. He spends $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, resulting in a total expenditure of $15. This leaves him with $70 - $15 = $55.

For the remaining days (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spends $2 each on plastic action figures. The number of plastic action figures he can purchase is given by $55 / $2 = 27.5. However, since he cannot buy a fraction of a figure, he will purchase 27 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures: 3 (wooden) + 27 (plastic) = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total cost incurred by Leah for her kitten, we must consider the expenses associated with spaying the animal, the cost of vaccinations, and the damages caused to her property.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the three vaccines can be calculated by multiplying the cost of a single vaccine ($20) by the number of vaccines (3), resulting in $60. Furthermore, the four broken vases, valued at $12 each, incur an additional expense of $48.

To obtain the total cost, we sum these expenses: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccinations) + $48 (damages) = $308.

Therefore, the total cost incurred by Leah for her kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we must first calculate the total number of roses required. The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 

We can calculate the total number of roses required by multiplying the number of roses each shop orders per week by the number of weeks in a month (approximately 4 weeks). 

Total roses required = (20 + 15 + 30) * 4
Total roses required = 65 * 4
Total roses required = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. To find the total number of roses he grows in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by the number of weeks in a month:

Total roses grown = 40 * 4
Total roses grown = 160 roses

To determine the number of roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses grown from the total roses required:

Roses lacking = Total roses required - Total roses grown
Roses lacking = 260 - 160
Roses lacking = 100

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can employ the concept of present value of an annuity. The formula for the present value of an annuity is given by:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where:
PV = present value (initial amount)
PMT = monthly payment = $100
r = monthly interest rate (assuming 0% interest, as no interest rate is mentioned)
n = number of periods = 24 months

However, since we are dealing with a simple withdrawal scenario without interest, we can use a more straightforward approach:

Total amount withdrawn in 2 years = PMT * n
= $100 * 24
= $2400

Now, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total amount withdrawn
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

Therefore, the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich. In this case, the food truck sold 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $70.00.

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and since one loaf yields 10 sandwiches, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00. Additionally, the food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

The net profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. In this case, the net profit is $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we must first calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can find the total number of crayons by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

Total crayons = 3 * 64
Total crayons = 192

Next, we need to determine how many muffin crayons Kate can make from the total number of crayons. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8.

Number of muffin crayons = Total crayons / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 192 / 8
Number of muffin crayons = 24

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

Total amount of money = Number of muffin crayons * Price per muffin
Total amount of money = 24 * $1.50
Total amount of money = $36

"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must consider the costs associated with the carpet, padding, and installation. 

First, we calculate the area of the room, which is given by the product of its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

"To determine the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we must first calculate the total number of birds observed over the 7-day period. This can be achieved by summing the individual daily counts.

The total number of birds observed is the sum of the birds seen on each day: 50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7).

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
= 280

To find the average number of birds per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days, which is 7.

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the operations into steps:

1. The starting value of 20 is increased by half of itself, which is 10. This results in 20 + 10 = 30.
2. The resulting value, 30, is then divided by 5, yielding 30 / 5 = 6.
3. Finally, the result, 6, is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. This gives us 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"

The boy possesses 5 cards, while his brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. This implies that the brother's card count can be calculated as 5 - 3 = 2. 

Subsequently, the total number of cards they possess can be obtained by adding the boy's card count to the brother's card count: 5 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is deviating from the actual temperature. This can be done by finding the difference between the actual temperature (468) and the set temperature (450), which yields a deviation of 18 degrees.

The percentage deviation can be calculated as follows:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This indicates that the oven is 4% hotter than the actual temperature. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to adjust the set temperature by the percentage deviation.

The correct temperature setting can be found by adding the percentage deviation to the original temperature. 

4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

Therefore, the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To determine the total time required to watch the two movies, we must first convert the duration of each film to minutes. The first movie, consisting of 1 hour and 30 minutes, can be converted to minutes by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes, yielding 90 minutes. Similarly, the second movie, comprising 2 hours and 5 minutes, can be converted to minutes by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes, resulting in 125 minutes.

The total time required to watch both movies is then obtained by adding the individual durations together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To determine the combined value of the two houses, we first need to calculate the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. This can be achieved by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To calculate 30% of this value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3, resulting in $22,800. Subtracting this amount from Herb's house value yields Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, we can calculate the combined value of the two houses by adding their individual values: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we must first establish the quantities of cups and dishes each individual brought.

Judy initially purchased a dozen cups, which equates to 12 cups. Furthermore, she acquired twice the number of dishes as cups, resulting in 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend, on the other hand, brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, which translates to 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The combined total of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The combined total of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is the sum of cups and dishes, which is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we must first calculate the discounted price of two boxes. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

The discount amount is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00. Therefore, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. 

Since Pete is purchasing two boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00. 

Now, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts. Since one box contains 90 pairs, two boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs. 

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

Given that she spends 2 hours engaging in aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour, we can calculate the total calories burned as follows:

Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah requires 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can determine the total amount of water she needs by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100
Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, which can be expressed as:

B + R + G = 4500

Additionally, we know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as:

R = 0.99B

Lastly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we obtain:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combining like terms yields:

2B + 0.01B = 4500

Simplifying further, we get:

2.01B = 4500

Dividing both sides by 2.01, we find:

B = 2250

Now that we have determined the value of B, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans using the equation R = 0.99B:

R = 0.99(2250)
R = 2227.5

Similarly, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans using the equation G = 1.01B:

G = 1.01(2250)
G = 2275

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 2275 - 2227.5
G - R = 47.5

The final answer is: 47.5"
"To determine Jared's average typing speed, we must first calculate the third measurement. Given that his initial speed was 47 words per minute (WPM) and it increased by 5 words to 52 WPM, we can calculate the third measurement as 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Next, we sum the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over a 5-week period. 

Let's denote the weight change per week for the Cheerios option as $w_c$ and the weight change per week for the donuts option as $w_d$. We are given that $w_c = -1.25$ pounds/week and $w_d = 1.75$ pounds/week.

The total weight change over 5 weeks for the Cheerios option is $5w_c = 5(-1.25) = -6.25$ pounds.

Similarly, the total weight change over 5 weeks for the donuts option is $5w_d = 5(1.75) = 8.75$ pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is $8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of individuals attending the event, we must consider the various components of the guest list. 

First, we account for the initial invitations extended by Alex, which comprise 100 individuals. Subsequently, each of these 100 individuals plans to invite two additional acquaintances, resulting in an additional 200 guests. Furthermore, Alex personally extends invitations to 10 friends, with 8 of these friends opting to bring their spouses, thereby adding 18 more individuals to the guest list.

By summing these components, we arrive at a total of 100 (initial invitations) + 200 (friends' invitations) + 10 (Alex's personal invitations) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 328 individuals.

Therefore, Alex will need 328 seats for the event.

**Answer: 328**"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can analyze the given information step by step.

First, we know that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Given that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund's weight can be calculated as 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, we are informed that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Therefore, the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, it is stated that the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Consequently, the Mastiff's weight can be calculated as 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the comparative cost of the boots on eBay versus Amazon, we must consider the total cost of the boots and shipping on each platform.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16, and shipping incurs an additional $4, resulting in a total cost of $20.

In contrast, on eBay, the boots are priced at $13, with shipping costs being twice as much as on Amazon, which equates to $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To calculate the difference in cost between the two platforms, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days required for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's window height, we can model the growth of the beanstalk using exponential growth. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles in height every day, we can express its height at any time t (in days) as:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that h(t) > 20, which represents the height of Mark's window.

We can solve this inequality by finding the smallest integer value of t that satisfies:

4 * 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.32.

Since t must be an integer, the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is t = 3.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the total amount of protein John consumes per week, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily, and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can first establish the daily protein intake by multiplying the daily mushroom consumption by the protein content per cup.

The protein content per cup is 3 grams, so the daily protein intake can be calculated as follows:

200 grams (daily mushroom consumption) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

To find the weekly protein intake, we can multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7):

600 grams (daily protein intake) * 7 days (per week) = 4200 grams of protein per week

Therefore, John's weekly protein intake is 4200 grams.

The final answer is 4200."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jerry's current age as x. The given information states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be translated into the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Thus, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost of the dental work, we must first calculate the total amount he still owes after accounting for the initial deposit.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George requires two implants, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $2000 = $4000. Additionally, he wishes to have a crown made of porcelain, which incurs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already made an initial payment of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to cover, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Given that George earns $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he must work to cover the remaining amount by dividing the outstanding balance by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x. We can express this relationship as an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we obtain:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 30

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the measures of the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the third angle is the largest, its measure is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of money he possesses. This can be achieved by summing the values of his various coins.

The value of his quarters is 8 x $0.25 = $2.00.
The value of his dimes is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
The value of his nickels is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
The value of his pennies is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Colby has by adding these values together: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of a single gumball: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of legs for each species and summing them up.

The total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these values together yields a total of 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we first calculate the 50% increase in the initial weight of 8 pounds. This can be found by multiplying 8 pounds by 0.5, resulting in 4 pounds. 

The new weight is then obtained by adding the 50% increase to the initial weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal decides to use a weight two pounds lighter than the calculated 12 pounds. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds to find the final weight: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down his gaming activity into three distinct periods: the first year, the second year, and the third year.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This results in a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve again receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This yields a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month. This results in a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games. Furthermore, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we sum the number of games from each year: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can employ the concept of uniform motion. Given that the plane covers a distance of 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can utilize the formula for time, which is:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we first need to establish their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's production rate can be calculated by dividing the total amount of chocolates he makes in 2 hours by 2, yielding 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates each individual produces in 12 hours. Ruiz's total production is 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, while Marissa's total production is 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The combined total is the sum of their individual production, which is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total expenditure and subtract it from his initial amount.

Let's denote the amount spent on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We are given that M = $8. It is also stated that T = 2M and W = 4T.

We can express T and W in terms of M:
T = 2M
W = 4(2M)
W = 8M

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure:
Total expenditure = M + T + W
= M + 2M + 8M
= 11M

Given that M = $8, we can substitute this value into the equation:
Total expenditure = 11M
= 11($8)
= $88

The initial amount Howard had was $100. To find the amount left, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial amount:
Amount left = Initial amount - Total expenditure
= $100 - $88
= $12

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the first four hours and the next two hours.

During the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This yields a revenue of $7.50 per hour. Multiplying this hourly revenue by the number of hours worked (4) gives us a total revenue of $30.

In the subsequent two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This results in a revenue of $6 per hour. Multiplying this hourly revenue by the number of hours worked (2) yields a total revenue of $12.

The total earnings from selling lemonade for 6 hours can be found by adding the revenues from both periods: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tire, we must first calculate the total number of rotations it can undergo before reaching its maximum capacity. Given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we can proceed with the calculation.

The car drives 400 miles per month, and we are asked to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced. To do this, we must first calculate the total number of miles driven per year.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per year by dividing the total miles driven per year by 2.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we can determine the lifespan of the tire by dividing the total number of rotations it can undergo by the number of rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

Therefore, the tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4362.5}$"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can employ a straightforward approach by first establishing the cost per washing. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can calculate the cost per washing as follows:

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can then calculate the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of pumps used per wash:

Cost per pump = Cost per washing / 1 pump
= $0.20 / 1
= $0.20

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we can multiply by 100:

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.20 * 100
= 20 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the outfit. The shirt has a discounted price of $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The pair of shorts costs $35. Therefore, the total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we must calculate the sales tax amount. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), the sales tax is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20. The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

To find the amount of money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from his initial budget: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70.

The final amount of money Joe will have left is -$6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to produce 1 dozen croissants, we can establish a conversion factor of 1/4 pound per dozen. 

Given that Juan aims to produce 4 dozen croissants daily for a period of 7 days, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed as follows:

First, we multiply the number of croissants by the conversion factor to obtain the daily butter requirement:

4 dozen croissants * (1/4 pound / 1 dozen) = 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound per day

Next, we multiply the daily butter requirement by the number of days to determine the total amount of butter needed:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will require 7 pounds of butter to produce 4 dozen croissants daily for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we must first calculate the total cost of repaving each street. This can be achieved by multiplying the cost per meter by the respective street lengths.

For Monica's street, the cost is $194 per meter, and the length is 150 meters. Therefore, the total cost for Monica's street is $194 * 150 = $29,100.

Similarly, for Lewis' street, the cost per meter is $194, and the length is 490 meters. Thus, the total cost for Lewis' street is $194 * 490 = $95,060.

To find the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received a constant funding of $100,000 per month. Therefore, the total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This forms a geometric sequence with a first term of $100,000 and a common ratio of 1.5. The sum of this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = $100,000 * (1 - 1.5^5) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $100,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * 13.1875
S = $1,318,750

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $1,318,750 = $1,818,750

The total cost of John's research is $1,818,750."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we must consider the individual contributions of each player. 

The first player consumed a 6-ounce steak. The second player consumed 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. The third player consumed a 1-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces. Since the fourth and fifth players opted for vegetarian meals, they did not contribute to the total ounces of meat consumed.

To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed, we sum the individual contributions: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we must first consider the number of days in the month. March has 31 days.

Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can calculate the total number of posts by multiplying the number of posts per day by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = 3 posts/day * 31 days
Total number of posts in March = 93 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To determine the annual expenditure on water for laundry, we must first calculate the total gallons of water utilized in a year. Given that Gary performs laundry twice a week, we can calculate the total number of loads per year as 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads.

Each load of laundry requires 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, and therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 12 inches.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the daily meat production of Prince, which is given as 15 kg per hour and 10 hours of work per day. This yields a daily production of 15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg per day.

Next, we divide the total weight of the bull (750 kg) by the daily production (150 kg) to obtain the number of days required to sell the meat. This calculation is as follows:

750 kg / 150 kg per day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to calculate the total number of seats. Given that there are 4 rows of seats, each containing 18 seats, the total number of seats can be found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row:

Total seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total seats = 4 * 18
Total seats = 72

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, we can calculate this as:

Seats occupied by administrators = Total seats * 1/4
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 * 1/4
Seats occupied by administrators = 18

The remaining seats after administrators are removed can be found by subtracting the number of seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats:

Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by parents. Since one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, we can calculate this as:

Seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * 1/3
Seats occupied by parents = 54 * 1/3
Seats occupied by parents = 18

Finally, the number of seats occupied by students can be found by subtracting the number of seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats:

Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents
Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Seats occupied by students = 36

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, resulting in a total of 2 more pieces chewed.

The total number of pieces chewed throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, when he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at a cost of $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 × $3 = $27.

Conversely, the basketball coach acquired 8 basketballs at a cost of $14 each, yielding a total expenditure of 8 × $14 = $112.

The difference in expenditure between the two coaches can be calculated as $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by this proportion.

Let's denote the total number of flowers as 'x'. We know that 4/5 of 'x' represents the number of bloomed flowers. This can be expressed as:

4/5 * x = number of bloomed flowers

We are also given that the total number of flowers is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4/5 * 200 = number of bloomed flowers

To solve for the number of bloomed flowers, we can multiply 4/5 by 200:

(4/5) * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

Thus, the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. This can be achieved by dividing her speed by 1000, as 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

Given that Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, we can calculate her speed in Mb per second as follows:

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can then multiply her speed by 60 to obtain her speed in Mb per hour:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total number of cars towed that week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as 'a' and the number of cars towed on each of the remaining days as 'b'. We are given that 'a' is 10 and 'b' is 10 - 4 = 6.

The total number of cars towed on the first three days is 3a, and the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 4b. Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 3a + 4b.

Substituting the values of 'a' and 'b', we get:
3(10) + 4(6) = 30 + 24 = 54

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to meet the minimum height requirement, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches, as Adam's height is currently measured in inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Next, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height to find the height difference: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Finally, we divide the height difference by Adam's annual growth rate of 2 inches to determine the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the minimum height requirement to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings, we must first calculate the profit made on the sale of the vehicles. The initial cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and James sold 10 cars, resulting in a total cost of 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company's payment for the vehicles constitutes 30% of the total cost, which equates to 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000. Consequently, the profit is the difference between the total cost and the company's payment, yielding $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James' commission on the profit is 10%, which can be calculated as 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James' total earnings are $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can calculate this as 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which equals 15. 

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total price of the three jewels, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the price of the diamond as D, the price of the gold as G, and the price of the silver as S.

Given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond, we can express this relationship as:

G = (4/5)D

Additionally, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, which can be represented as:

S = G - 400

We are also given that the price of a diamond is $2000. Substituting this value into the first equation, we can solve for the price of gold:

G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

Now that we have the price of gold, we can find the price of silver:

S = G - 400
S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

With the prices of all three jewels determined, we can calculate the total price by adding them together:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the value of S into the second equation to find T: T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Then, we can substitute the value of T into the third equation to find R: R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Since they are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

The time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of fish Tommy caught, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

Given that Naomi caught 17 fish, we have N = 17.

It is also stated that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so we can express this relationship as D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Lastly, it is mentioned that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be represented as T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class.

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as C and the maximum cost per class as M. We are given that C = $60 and M = $10. We also know that Manny has already signed up for 10 classes.

The total cost of the classes can be expressed as the product of the number of classes (n) and the cost per class (M): C = nM.

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can set up the inequality nM > C to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

Substituting the given values, we get:

n(10) > 60

To solve for n, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 10:

n > 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting 10 from the total number of classes:

n - 10 > 6 - 10

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

n - 10 > -4

Adding 10 to both sides of the inequality, we get:

n > 6

Since n represents the total number of classes, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production of Julie and Jewel, we must first establish their individual daily production rates. Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast, her daily production rate is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The combined daily production rate is the sum of their individual rates: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the distances covered by Reggie, Paisley, and Lynn.

Let's denote the distance covered by Lynn as 'L'. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Additionally, Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Furthermore, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can express this as 20 = L + 3.

Solving for L, we get L = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can employ the concept of unit prices and the principle of multiplication. 

First, we establish the unit prices for each item: $5.20 per apple and $3.30 per orange. 

Next, we calculate the total cost of 5 apples by multiplying the unit price by the quantity: 5 apples * $5.20/apple = $26.00.

Similarly, we calculate the total cost of 5 oranges by multiplying the unit price by the quantity: 5 oranges * $3.30/orange = $16.50.

Finally, we add the total costs of the apples and oranges to obtain the overall cost: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

The final answer is: $42.50"
"To determine the time required to dig the hole, we must first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole in this case, is given by the product of its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time_per_cubic_foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we must first calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them with the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's new annual salary, we must first calculate the total increase in his monthly compensation. The 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary is calculated as 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. Additionally, he receives a bonus equivalent to half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

The new monthly salary can be found by adding the raise and the bonus to his original monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To calculate the annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12: $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' purchases, we must first calculate the individual costs of each item and then sum them.

The cost of the suits can be calculated as 10 suits multiplied by the cost per suit, which is $750. This yields a total of $7500.

The cost of the dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit, which is $750. Therefore, the cost of the dress pants is 10 * (1/5 * $750) = $1500.

The cost of the dress shirts is $60 each, and James purchases 10 shirts. Thus, the total cost of the dress shirts is 10 * $60 = $600.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $600 = $9000.

The total cost of everything is $9000."
"To determine the total number of articles published by the two websites, we can calculate the daily production of each and then multiply by the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, while its sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. To find the total number of articles published by both websites in a month, we can multiply the daily production of each by the number of days in February (28).

Total articles published by the news website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles
Total articles published by the sister company = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is the sum of these two values:
Total articles = 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The final answer is: $\boxed{840}$"
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can analyze the given information systematically.

1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. T = W / 2
4. SW = T - 3

Substituting the value of W from equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
T = (S + 4) / 2
T = (60 + 4) / 2
T = 64 / 2
T = 32

Now, substituting the value of T into equation (4), we get:
SW = 32 - 3
SW = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we can employ a straightforward multiplication approach. Each bag is comprised of 8 portions, with each portion weighing 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

"To determine the total number of likes, we can start by calculating the initial number of likes. We are given that the number of likes three weeks after posting the selfie was 70 times the initial number of likes. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

The equation representing the situation is: 
70x = 2000 + 20000

Simplifying the equation:
70x = 22000

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 22000 / 70
x = 314.29

Since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a like. Therefore, the initial number of likes is 314.

To find the total number of likes, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes:
Total likes = 314 + 20000
Total likes = 20114

The final answer is 20114."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we can calculate the total cost of the purchase on each day.

On Tuesday, Clara initially paid $20 per pomegranate, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $20 = $400. However, she received a $2 discount, bringing the final cost to $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, Sheila purchased 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 per fruit. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, which can be calculated as 20 * $30 * 0.10 = $60. Subtracting this discount from the total cost yields $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can start by establishing the relationship between the sales of red and green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats in the first month were half the total amount earned from selling green hats, we can express this as:

Red sales = 1/2 * G
Red sales = $400

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for G, we get:

G = 2 * $400
G = $800

Now that we know the sales from green hats in the first month, we can calculate the total sales for the first month:

Total sales (first month) = Red sales + Green sales
= $400 + $800
= $1200

In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can express this as:

Second-month sales = 3/4 * Total sales (first month)
= 3/4 * $1200
= $900

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales from both months:

Total sales (two months) = Total sales (first month) + Second-month sales
= $1200 + $900
= $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we must first calculate the number of paid hours. The rental period spans from 5 PM to 9 PM, encompassing a total of 4 hours. However, James is entitled to 1 hour of free time, which reduces the number of paid hours to 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost structure for the rental is as follows: the first paid hour incurs a fixed charge of $15, while each subsequent hour incurs a charge that is twice the cost of the initial hour. Therefore, the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost can be calculated by summing the cost of the first paid hour and the cost of the remaining hours: $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can utilize the concept of a bank account balance. The initial balance in her account was $200, and it increased to $420. This implies that the difference between the final and initial balance represents the amount of money that was added to her account.

The increase in the bank account balance can be calculated as follows:

$420 (final balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220

This $220 represents the total amount of money that was added to Sally's account. However, we are interested in finding the amount withheld from her wage. Given that her weekly wage should be $300, we can calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the total amount added to her account from her wage:

$300 (weekly wage) - $220 (amount added) = $80

Therefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs required for the party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will consume.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'g' and the number of deviled egg halves per guest as 'd'. The total number of deviled egg halves required is then given by the equation:

Total deviled egg halves = g * d

In this scenario, g = 16 and d = 3. Substituting these values into the equation yields:

Total deviled egg halves = 16 * 3 = 48

Since each deviled egg half requires one whole egg, the total number of eggs needed is twice the number of deviled egg halves. Therefore, the total number of eggs required is:

Total eggs = 2 * 48 = 96

To express this in dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

Total dozens = 96 / 12 = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 1 by 3, which equals approximately 0.33. To find the fraction of the paper she has left to write, we subtract this value from 1, which equals 1 - 0.33 = 0.67.

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the total number of pages to find the number of pages she has left to write: 0.67 * 15 = 10.

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of days required to complete the reading assignment, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Given that Mike plans to read 10 pages per day, we can calculate the total number of days needed to finish the 200-page book as follows:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days required to finish the book from the total available time:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we must consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the compounding effect of these costs over 12 months.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000. 

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs, which is $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To determine the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12, resulting in $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price and the first year's costs, which is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can start by establishing the individual cooking times for each item. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes.

We are also given that P = R + 20, which allows us to express P in terms of R. Substituting R = 30 into this equation, we find P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Furthermore, we know that B = (P + R) / 2. Substituting the values of P and R, we get B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total cooking time by summing the individual cooking times: R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can calculate the cost of each component and then find the difference.

Let's denote the cost of 1 pound of almonds as A and the cost of 1 pound of walnuts as W. We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. To find the total cost, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6. We can then convert the fractions to have a common denominator:

1/2 = 3/6 and 1/3 = 2/6

The cost of the first mixture is then (3/6)A + (2/6)W = (3/6)($10) + (2/6)($15) = $30/6 + $30/6 = $60/6 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. Again, we find the LCM of 5 and 3, which is 15. We can then convert the fractions to have a common denominator:

1/5 = 3/15 and 1/3 = 5/15

The cost of the second mixture is then (3/15)A + (5/15)W = (3/15)($10) + (5/15)($15) = $30/15 + $75/15 = $105/15 = $7.

The difference in cost between the two mixtures is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We are given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70, where 4s accounts for the legs of the sheep and 2g accounts for the legs of the geese.

The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20, as each animal has one head.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can find 'g' by substituting 's' into the equation g = 20 - s:
g = 20 - 15
g = 5

Therefore, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we must first calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

The cost of the coffee can be found by multiplying the number of pounds purchased (7) by the cost per pound of the more expensive brand ($6). This yields a total cost of 7 * $6 = $42.

Next, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total expenditure on the other items. The cost of two bags of chips is $2.00 each, so the total cost for the chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Additionally, the cost of a bucket of fried chicken and a bottle of soda is $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00. Therefore, the total cost of these items is $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00.

Given that Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can find the cost of the apple pie by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total expenditure: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C are 198 and 209, respectively, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. The total number of newspapers delivered can be represented by the equation:

x + 198 + 209 = 600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 407 = 600

Subtracting 407 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we must first calculate the total class time he spends in the class. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of classes per week by the duration of each class.

Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week

Next, we need to calculate the total class time over the duration of the class. Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the weekly class time by the number of weeks.

Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, we can determine the number of recipes John learns by dividing the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe. This is calculated as follows:

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 32 recipes

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we first need to calculate the number of math teachers on the court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 0.6 * 150
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the amount of money each individual would have if they decided to share their total wealth equally, we must first calculate the amount of money each person possesses.

Aurelia's wealth is given as $120.

Kassidy's wealth is 3/4 times that of Aurelia's, which can be calculated as (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna's wealth is 60 dollars more than Kassidy's, resulting in 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

The total amount of money among the three individuals is the sum of their respective wealth: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To determine the amount each person would receive if they were to share their total wealth equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total duration of the game, we must consider the standard structure of a basketball game, which consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. However, in this instance, the game was extended due to a tie in the last quarter, resulting in an additional 5 minutes.

The total duration of the game can be calculated by multiplying the number of quarters by the length of each quarter and then adding the additional time. This yields:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we find 20% of the total employees, which represents the management staff. This is calculated as 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Next, we need to find 30% of the management staff, as this group oversees the entire company. This is calculated as 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we can employ the concept of scalar multiplication. 

Given that Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt per muffin, we can calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins by multiplying the respective amounts by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins is the sum of these individual amounts: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual would receive when the total amount is divided equally among the three of them, we must first calculate the total amount of candy available. This can be achieved by summing the individual amounts of candy each person possesses.

The total amount of candy is 3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds.

To find the amount each person would receive, we then divide the total amount by the number of individuals, which is 3. This can be calculated as 12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds.

Therefore, each person would receive 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased. The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 times the cost of one candy of type A, which is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost of type A candies is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.

Similarly, the cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 times the cost of one candy of type B, which is $0.75. Thus, the total cost of type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is the sum of the costs of type A and type B candies, which is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received can be calculated as $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can begin by establishing the total number of days and categorizing them based on their respective moods. Christina's mood records span 30 days, consisting of 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the remainder neutral.

We can deduce the number of neutral days by subtracting the sum of good and bad days from the total number of days: 30 - (12 + 8) = 10. This implies that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral.

However, we are informed that the subsequent three days were good, neutral, and good, respectively. Consequently, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of books Sally possesses, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we first convert the initial height from feet to inches. Given that there are 12 inches in a foot, the initial height of 20 feet is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Next, we calculate the remaining height that the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find the number of days required for the bamboo to reach the target height, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can approach the problem by considering the changing number of dogs in the shelter.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating that each dog requires one toy. This establishes a baseline of 4 toys.

As the number of dogs in the shelter increases, so does the number of toys required. With 8 additional dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Consequently, James needs 12 toys.

However, upon returning, the number of dogs doubles to 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Nevertheless, 3 dogs are no longer present, reducing the total number of dogs to 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog necessitates one toy, James requires 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the amount invested by Dylan, which is 2/5 of the total amount. This can be calculated as:

2/5 * 1200 = 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
1200 - 480 = 720

Then, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We can calculate this as:
(2/3) * 720 = 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount invested by Skyler:
720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their desired total and the current total. 

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We are given that C = 20 and J = 44. The sisters aim to reach a total of 100 signatures. 

The number of signatures they need to collect can be found by subtracting the current total from the desired total: 100 - (C + J). 

Substituting the given values, we get: 100 - (20 + 44) = 100 - 64 = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings over a two-day period, we must first establish her hourly wage. Given that Karen's hourly wage is twice that of Lorie's, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage can be calculated as 2 * $10 = $20.

With this information, we can then calculate Karen's daily earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day, which is 3. This yields $20 * 3 = $60.

Finally, to find Karen's earnings over a two-day period, we multiply her daily earnings by 2, resulting in $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportionality. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

This ratio can be simplified to 1 potato : 6 hash browns. To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the ratio of hash browns per potato.

Number of hash browns = 96 potatoes * (6 hash browns / 1 potato)
= 96 * 6
= 576 / 6
= 96

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 96 hash browns.

The final answer is 96."
"To determine the excess weight of the group, we must first calculate the total weight of the individuals. Since each adult weighs 80 kg, the total weight of the 9 individuals can be found by multiplying the weight of one adult by the total number of adults.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can employ a step-by-step approach to solve the problem.

Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as K, the number of cookies Max has as M, the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as C, and the number of cookies Summer has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can use substitution to solve for the number of cookies each person has.

From equation (1), we can express M in terms of K:
M = K + 5

Substituting this expression for M into equation (2), we get:
C + 12 = K + 5
C = K - 7

Now, we can substitute the expression for M into equation (3):
S = (K + 5) + 23
S = K + 28

Now that we have expressions for M, C, and S in terms of K, we can find the total number of cookies:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = K + (K + 5) + (K - 7) + (K + 28)
Total cookies = 4K + 26

Substituting K = 68 into the expression for total cookies, we get:
Total cookies = 4(68) + 26
Total cookies = 272 + 26
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can employ algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown variable. Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, resulting in a new length of 1.5x. Additionally, a 20cm lace trim is added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress can be expressed as 1.5x + 20.

Given that the final length of the dress is 140cm, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation yields:

1.5x = 120

Dividing both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the total time as 't'. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can set up the following equation:

t = (1/2)t + (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t = (1/2)t + 20

Subtracting (1/2)t from both sides:

(1/2)t = 20

Multiplying both sides by 2:

t = 40

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 40 minutes.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to reach school without being late, we must first calculate the total time spent walking to the fire station. This can be achieved by adding the time taken to reach the corner where the library is to the time taken to reach the fire station.

Time taken to reach the corner = 6 minutes
Time taken to reach the fire station = 13 minutes

Total time spent walking = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Since the total time available is 30 minutes, we can calculate the remaining time by subtracting the total time spent walking from the total time available.

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking
= 30 - 19
= 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To determine the total cost of Catherine's grocery purchase, we can employ the principle of linear algebra to calculate the total expenditure. 

Let's denote the cost of 1 kilo of apples as A, the cost of 1 kilo of bananas as B, and the cost of 1 kilo of oranges as O. We are given the following information:

A = $4
B = $2
O = $3

Catherine purchases 1 kilo of apples, 2 kilos of bananas, and 2 kilos of oranges. We can express the total cost (TC) as a linear combination of the individual costs:

TC = 1A + 2B + 2O

Substituting the given values, we get:

TC = 1($4) + 2($2) + 2($3)
TC = $4 + $4 + $6
TC = $14

Therefore, Catherine paid a total of $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the combined total of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. The total number of cookies baked is then 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

After consuming 10 cookies, the remaining number of cookies in the box can be calculated as 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, the age of the older triplet would be x + 7, and the age of the older twin would be x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides yields:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-examine our initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

This can be rewritten as:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x must be a whole number, we can try to find a whole number solution. Let's re-examine the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

We can rewrite this as:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

However, we can try to find a whole number solution by re-examining the original equation. Let's try x = 7:

7 + (7 + 7) + (7 + 7 + 7) = 7 + 14 + 21 = 42

This is close to the target value of 44. Let's try x = 8:

8 + (8 + 7) + (8 + 7 + 7) = 8 + 15 + 22 = 45

This exceeds the target value of 44. Since we are looking for a whole number solution, we can try x = 7.33 (which is not a whole number) or x = 7.33 is not a whole number, so we try x = 7.

7 + (7 + 7) + (7 + 7 + 7) = 7 + 14 + 21 = 42

"To determine the amount of time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time constraint of 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, 3 hours can be calculated as 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John dedicates to his homework. The time allocated for math, reading, and history can be added together: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we can find the time available for a nap by subtracting the total homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two separate calculations. 

First, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops by multiplying the cost of one lollipop by 10:
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one candy by 10:
10 candies * $3.20 = $32.00

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we can calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as R and Neil's monthly savings as N. We are given that R = 20 and N = R + (2/5)R = (7/5)R.

The total number of coins Rong saves in a year is 12R, and the total number of coins Neil saves in a year is 12N. We can express this as:

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 10 * 12R = 120R
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 10 * 12N = 120N

Substituting N = (7/5)R into the equation for Neil's total savings, we get:

Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 120 * (7/5)R = 168R

Now, we can find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years by adding their individual totals:

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 120R + 168R = 288R

Substituting R = 20, we get:

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 288 * 20 = 5760

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with, we must first calculate the total cost of the vet visit. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and John's dog requires 2 vaccines. Therefore, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let the total bill be represented by 'x', then 0.6x is the cost of the heartworm check. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation as x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

The total bill is $100, and the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. Therefore, the total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John initially brought $125 with him. After spending $100 on the vet visit, he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To determine the total cost of the crate, we must first establish the cost of each individual fruit. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of a banana can be calculated as 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Furthermore, since oranges are the most expensive item, with their cost being three times that of a banana, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective cost and summing these values. 

The total cost of the crate is given by the expression: 
5 * $1 + 12 * $0.5 + 7 * $3

This expression can be simplified as follows:
5 * $1 + 12 * $0.5 + 7 * $3 = $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we must first establish the number of each colored square. 

We are given that the comforter contains 14 red squares. It is stated that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18. Furthermore, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, which yields 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, resulting in 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

To calculate the total area of the comforter, we sum the number of each colored square: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the total number of chairs required. This can be calculated by summing the number of adults, babies, high chairs, and regular chairs.

Let's denote the number of high chairs as H and the number of regular chairs as R. We are given that H = 8 and that the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs (R = 5H). 

We can express the total number of chairs needed as: Total = H + 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 8 + 42 + 15 = 65.

Since R = 5H, we can substitute the value of H into the equation for R: R = 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs needed: Total = H + R = 8 + 40 = 48.

To find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire, we subtract the total number of chairs she already has from the total number of chairs required: Additional chairs = Total - 48 = 65 - 48 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we can employ a straightforward approach by first identifying the total number of bucks and then calculating 20% of that quantity.

Given that 50% of the deer in the field are bucks, we can deduce that the remaining 50% are does. Consequently, the number of bucks can be calculated as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we can calculate 20% of the number of bucks to determine the number of 8-point bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we can start by calculating the points collected by each individual.

Let's denote Adam's points as A, Betty's points as B, Tom's points as T, and Marta's points as M. We are given the following information:

1. A = 50
2. B = A + 0.3A = 1.3A
3. T = B - 30
4. M = 3T

We can substitute the value of A into equation (2) to find B:
B = 1.3A = 1.3(50) = 65

Next, we can substitute the value of B into equation (3) to find T:
T = B - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35

Now, we can substitute the value of T into equation (4) to find M:
M = 3T = 3(35) = 105

Now, we can calculate the total points collected by the students:
Total points = A + B + T + M = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

To determine the number of points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ a combinatorial approach. We start with the initial number of great grand-mothers, which is 3. Each of these individuals has 3 children, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. 

Since each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 offspring of their own, we can calculate the total number of great grand-babies by multiplying the number of grandchildren by 3, yielding 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend after allocating 50% of her paycheck to her retirement account and 20% for her car payment, we can employ a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the amount allocated for retirement savings, which is 50% of her total paycheck. This can be expressed as 0.5 * $2400 = $1200.

Next, we calculate the amount allocated for the car payment, which is 20% of her total paycheck. This can be expressed as 0.2 * $2400 = $480.

Now, we subtract the sum of these two amounts from her original paycheck to determine the amount left for discretionary spending. This can be calculated as $2400 - ($1200 + $480) = $720.

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the total number of pencils present. Given that there are 20 spaces available and 4 pencils are missing, the total number of pencils can be found by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box.

Total pencils = 20 - 4 = 16

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Total pencils / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the total number of fireworks in the city and in her backyard.

The city's fireworks display consists of 15 boxes, each containing 20 fireworks. Therefore, the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate this as 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

In addition to the fireworks she can see from the city, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. This equates to 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we must first calculate the total number of items required. With 14 individuals in the group, each requiring 2 drinks and 3 snacks, the total number of items can be calculated as follows:

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42

Given that each item costs $2, the total cost can be found by multiplying the total number of items by the cost per item:

Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

Therefore, the group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy. We are given the following information:

1. G = 4,000 pounds
2. Gd = G + 800
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds: G + Gd + Gy = 11,600

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get:

4,000 + (4,000 + 800) + Gy = 11,600

Simplifying the equation:

8,800 + Gy = 11,600

Subtracting 8,800 from both sides:

Gy = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'x'. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate can be represented as 'x + 1'. 

We are given that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6x. Similarly, there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(x + 1).

Since the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is equal to the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can set up the equation:

6x + 8(x + 1) = total dumplings

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

6(3) + 8(3 + 1) = total dumplings
18 + 8(4) = total dumplings
18 + 32 = total dumplings
50 = total dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the amount of money Gerald had left after spending $10, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of Gerald's and Julia's shares is 3:2, with a total of 5 parts. 

We can calculate Gerald's initial share by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the fraction representing his share (3/5). This yields:

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Subsequently, we subtract the amount spent ($10) from Gerald's initial amount to determine the remaining balance:

Remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we can utilize the fundamental principles of kinematics. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can establish a ratio of their speeds. The speed of the cat is 15 feet per second, and thus, the speed of the turtle can be calculated as follows:

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the remaining amount they need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked to find the hourly fundraising amount: $4200 ÷ 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work: $4200 ÷ $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. Given that the city utilizes 40% of the river's water and 80% of this amount is dedicated to industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as follows:

80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

"To determine Marcus' total bill, we must first calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants can be found by multiplying the quantity (5) by the unit price ($3.00), resulting in a total of $15.00. Similarly, the total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00, the total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00, and the total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is the sum of these individual totals: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can approach this problem from a mathematical perspective. Given that each scoop costs $1.50 and Erin has $6.00, we can calculate the maximum number of scoops she can afford.

Let's denote the number of scoops Erin buys as 'x'. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free"", we can express the total cost as 1.5x (since she pays for 1.5 scoops). We want to find the maximum value of 'x' such that 1.5x ≤ 6.

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the inequality by 1.5:

x ≤ 6 ÷ 1.5
x ≤ 4

Since 'x' represents the number of scoops, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of days in the specified period. Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, resulting in a total of 4 * 14 = 56 pieces consumed over the 14-day period. Consequently, she is left with 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy.

Similarly, Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, leading to a total of 3 * 14 = 42 pieces consumed over the 14-day period. As a result, she is left with 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To determine the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two-thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 square foot bathroom, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom. This can be achieved by multiplying the total area by the fraction 2/3. 

The calculation yields: (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden requires 24 tiles per square foot, we can then multiply the area to be covered (24 square feet) by the number of tiles required per square foot (24). 

This results in: 24 * 24 = 576 tiles.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries himself, we must first calculate the total cost of purchasing the blueberries at the store. The cost per pound is $2.5, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

Next, we calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. James incurred an initial cost of $20 and an additional $1.5 per pound, resulting in a total cost of $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The amount James saved by picking the blueberries himself can be found by subtracting the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we first need to determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. This can be achieved by finding 10% of the original price and adding it to the original price.

The original price of each computer is $700. To calculate 10% of $700, we multiply $700 by 0.1, which equals $70. Adding this to the original price yields a new price of $700 + $70 = $770.

With the new price of each computer established at $770, we can then calculate the total amount paid by multiplying this price by the number of computers, which is 500.

"To determine the total calories in the omelet, we must consider the caloric contributions from each component. 

First, we calculate the caloric content of the eggs, which comprise 6 units, each contributing 75 calories. This yields a total of 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we examine the cheese, which consists of 2 ounces, with each ounce providing 120 calories. Consequently, the total caloric contribution from the cheese is 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Lastly, we consider the ham, which also consists of 2 ounces, with each ounce contributing 40 calories. Therefore, the total caloric contribution from the ham is 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

By summing the caloric contributions from the eggs, cheese, and ham, we arrive at the total caloric content of the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet has 770 calories."

Change = Payment - Total cost
Change = $10 - $5
Change = $5

The final answer is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can break down the process into steps and apply the given percentages.

First, we calculate the number of individuals who receive interviews. This is done by multiplying the total number of applicants (100) by the percentage of those who receive interviews (30% or 0.3).

Number of individuals receiving interviews = 100 * 0.3 = 30

Next, we find the number of individuals who receive a job offer. This is achieved by multiplying the number of individuals receiving interviews (30) by the percentage of those who receive a job offer (20% or 0.2).

Number of individuals receiving a job offer = 30 * 0.2 = 6

Finally, we calculate the number of individuals who accept the position. This is done by multiplying the number of individuals receiving a job offer (6) by the fraction representing the proportion of those who accept the position (1/3 or 0.3333...).

Number of individuals accepting the position = 6 * 0.3333... = 2

Therefore, 2 individuals accept the position."
"To determine the total weight of rice given away, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack. 

Given that Goldy gave away a total of 7 sacks (3 to her cousin and 4 to her brother) and each sack weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of rice given away can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Number of sacks given away * Weight per sack
Total weight = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack
Total weight = 175 kilograms

Therefore, Goldy gave away a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we must consider the distinct scenarios in which her tap rate changes. 

When her arms are down, her tap rate is 550 taps per minute, and she dances for 3 minutes. This yields a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 taps. 

When her arms are up, her tap rate decreases to 400 taps per minute, and she dances for 2 minutes. This results in 400 * 2 = 800 taps. 

The total number of taps is the sum of these two values: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we must consider the total cost associated with the repair. This includes the damage to his vehicle, the fine imposed by the city council, and the cost of the asphalt required for the repair.

The total cost of fixing the pothole can be calculated as the sum of the damage to his vehicle ($450) and the fine imposed by the city council ($120), plus the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets at $25 each, which equals $75). Therefore, the total cost is $450 + $120 + $75 = $645.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves the amount equal to the total cost minus the fine, which is $645 - $120 = $525.

The final answer is: $525"
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we must first calculate the total number of chairs available initially. The restaurant possesses 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies, resulting in a total of 193 chairs.

Next, we need to account for the chairs that were sent for repair. A total of 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were removed, totaling 33 chairs. 

To find the number of chairs left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total: 193 - 33 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To determine the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices available. With 5 individuals and each pizza having 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two of his friends consumed 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find the number of slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The remaining two friends consumed ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find the number of slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 = -20. However, this result is not feasible, as it implies a negative number of slices. This indicates an error in the initial calculation.

Reevaluating the problem, we consider the total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends: 2/3 of 12 slices per pizza is 8 slices per person, resulting in 8 x 3 = 24 slices. The remaining two friends ate 1 ½ pizzas, which is equivalent to 18 slices.

The correct calculation for the remaining slices is: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to consume the sausages, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. 

First, we establish the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages, which is given as 30 minutes. Since the dog consumes the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, we can calculate the dog's time as (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the average time by taking the harmonic mean of the two times. The harmonic mean is given by the formula: 

1 / (1/x1 + 1/x2)

where x1 and x2 are the times taken by the cat and dog, respectively. 

Plugging in the values, we get:

1 / (1/30 + 1/20) = 1 / ((2/60 + 3/60) = 1 / (5/60) = 60/5 = 12 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 12 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 90

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

This indicates that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we must first calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

Let's begin by calculating the number of windows smashed for students' cars. We are given that there are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows smashed for students' cars can be calculated as:

64 students' cars * 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Next, we calculate the number of windows smashed for teachers' cars. We are given that there are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows smashed for teachers' cars can be calculated as:

32 teachers' cars * 2 windows per car = 64 windows

To find the total number of windows smashed, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars:

256 windows (students) + 64 windows (teachers) = 320 windows

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools by adding the quantities of light blue and dark blue spools. This yields 60 blue spools.

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing the quantities of all spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

The percentage of blue spools can be found by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100. This results in (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of individuals who had not cast their vote by 16:00, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday, which is 2/5 of the total number of individuals in the queue. This can be expressed as (2/5) * 5000 = 2000.

Next, we need to find the number of individuals remaining after midday. This is obtained by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of individuals: 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

Then, we calculate the number of individuals who voted by 16:00, which is 2/3 of the remaining people. This can be calculated as (2/3) * 3000 = 2000.

Finally, to determine the number of individuals who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of individuals remaining after midday: 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The number of individuals who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we divide the total number of days (30) by the daily gum consumption (4 pieces). This yields a quotient of 7.5. 

Since gum is typically sold in whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has sufficient gum for the entire duration. 

Therefore, Parker will require 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of s'mores needed. This can be achieved by summing the number of s'mores desired by the kids and the adults.

The number of s'mores for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18, while the number of s'mores for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6. Therefore, the total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers yields 8 s'mores, we can calculate the number of sleeves needed by dividing the total number of s'mores by 8. This results in 24 / 8 = 3.

As each box contains 3 sleeves, the number of boxes required is equal to the number of sleeves needed, which is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can employ a step-by-step approach to calculate their individual ages and subsequently their total age.

Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we can calculate her father's age by utilizing the relationship between their ages. It is stated that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 38 years

Furthermore, we are informed that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34 years

Now, we can determine the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"

Total weight = 4 + 4 + 3 + 6
Total weight = 17 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can first calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can express this as 1.5 times the number of votes candidate A received. 

Given that candidate A received 20% of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes candidate B received as 1.5 * 0.2 * 100 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received can be found by subtracting the sum of votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of votes: 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the exchange, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This implies that Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new total becomes 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Meanwhile, Boris's new total is 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the exchange can be calculated by subtracting Beck's new total from Boris's new total: 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the exchange.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water left, we must first calculate the total amount of water utilized for each type of ice cube. 

The giant ice cubes require 4 ounces of water per cube, and Peter makes 3 of them, resulting in a total of 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. The medium ice cubes use 2 ounces of water per cube, and he makes 7 of them, resulting in a total of 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. Lastly, the small ice cubes use 0.5 ounces of water per cube, and he makes 8 of them, resulting in a total of 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

The total amount of water used is the sum of these amounts: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total amount used from the initial 32 ounces: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To determine the current number of glasses and plates, we must first calculate the initial quantities and then account for the broken items.

The initial number of glasses can be calculated by multiplying the number of dozens by 12, as there are 12 items in a dozen. Therefore, 8 dozen glasses equate to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.

Similarly, the initial number of plates can be determined by multiplying the number of dozens by 12. Consequently, 4 dozen plates equate to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Subsequently, we must subtract the number of broken items from the initial quantities to obtain the remaining items. The number of broken glasses is 10, and the number of broken plates is 6. Therefore, the remaining glasses are 96 - 10 = 86, and the remaining plates are 48 - 6 = 42.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of remaining glasses and plates by adding the remaining quantities together. This yields 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we need to analyze the transactions step by step.

Initially, Lorraine possesses 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Consequently, she is left with 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Consequently, she is left with 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.

Subsequently, she trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left, she trades them for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, we can calculate the total number of buttons she possesses. She has 3 small stickers and 60 small stickers from the last transaction, totaling 63 small stickers. Additionally, she has 20 large stickers.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process is 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of matches played on each day: Monday (2 matches), Friday (1 match), and Saturday (double the number of matches played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches).

The total number of matches played can be calculated by summing the individual match counts: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

Given that the total number of council members is 33, we can establish the following equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we obtain:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 11

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the number of votes in favor of the new regulation by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can utilize a systematic approach to calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of students requiring size extra-small as x. We are given that 11 students need this size. 

Since twice as many students need size small, the number of students requiring size small is 2x, which equals 22.

The number of students requiring size medium is four less than the number of size small students, so it can be expressed as 2x - 4, which equals 18.

The number of students requiring size large is half as many as size medium, so it can be expressed as (2x - 4) / 2, which equals 9.

Lastly, six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of students requiring size extra-large is 9 + 6, which equals 15.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of students: x + 2x + (2x - 4) + (2x - 4) / 2 + 9 + 15 = total number of students.

Combining like terms, we get: 11x + 22 + 2x - 4 + x + 9 + 15 = total number of students.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 14x + 42 = total number of students.

Since we know that the total number of students is 75, we can set up the equation 14x + 42 = 75.

Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get 14x = 33.

Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 2.36 (round down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a student).

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the total number of shirts ordered: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

Therefore, the total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To determine the amount after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The formula for finding the amount after a discount is:

Amount after discount = Marked price - (Discount percentage * Marked price)

In this case, the marked price is $140 and the discount percentage is 5%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Amount after discount = $140 - (0.05 * $140)
= $140 - $7
= $133

Therefore, the amount after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total duration of the playlists, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist to obtain the total number of songs. This yields 20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs.

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song, which is 10 hours. This results in 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60,000}$"
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win, which is 20% of 50. This can be computed as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, we calculate 60% of 40, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The remaining people who think horse #12 will win can be found by subtracting the sum of those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. Therefore, 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information. We are informed that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of these Pomeranians are girls. Given that there are six Pomeranian girls, we can establish an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3, yielding:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we have determined the total number of Pomeranians, we can calculate the total number of puppies Jana has. Since two-thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the following equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2, resulting in:

Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the amount Jayden still needs to purchase the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has available. Jayden initially possesses $70 from selling his photographs. His sister, Ava, contributes half of her $90 weekly allowance to aid him in acquiring the camera. 

We can calculate the amount Ava gives Jayden as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we sum the money Jayden already has with the money Ava provides:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera's cost is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the camera's cost:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden requires $85 more to purchase the camera.

$85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles required for the third house, we can start by establishing the relationship between the cases needed for each house. Let's denote the number of cases required for the first house as x. 

Given that the second house needs half the amount of the first house, the number of cases required for the second house is x/2. 

The third house requires double the amount of the first house, so the number of cases required for the third house is 2x.

We are told that the total number of cases required for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we can first multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

7x = 500

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 500/7
x = 71.43

Since x represents the number of cases required for the first house, we can now find the number of cases required for the third house by multiplying x by 2:

Number of cases for the third house = 2x
= 2 * 71.43
= 142.86

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the third house will need approximately 143 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 143"
"To determine the total expenditure, we must calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

Leila's expenditure on cucumbers can be calculated as 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.
Jack's expenditure on tomatoes is 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5.
Chase's expenditure on lettuce is $3.

The total expenditure is the sum of these individual expenditures: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we can start by calculating the number of pears he possesses. Given that he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can express this relationship as:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)

Let's denote the number of bananas as B. Then, the number of pears can be represented as B + 0.45B = 1.45B.

We are given that George has 200 bananas, so B = 200. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Number of pears = 1.45B = 1.45 * 200 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa purchased for Jimmy, we must first calculate the amount of money she had available for purchasing candy bars. This can be achieved by subtracting the cost of the ball from her initial amount of money.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can calculate the number of candy bars Marissa purchased by dividing the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we must first establish the quantity of oranges required. Given that 5 kilograms of oranges are necessary for 1 liter of juice, the amount needed for 4 liters can be calculated as 5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms.

The cost of oranges is $3 per kilogram. Therefore, the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges is 20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60.

Thus, the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice is $60."
"To determine the total number of books read, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'x'. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express the number of books Ezra read as 2x.

We are given that Ezra read a total of 300 books, which includes the initial 300 books and the additional 150 books he decided to read. This can be represented as:

2x = 300 + 150
2x = 450

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 450 / 2
x = 225

Now that we know Ahmed read 225 books, we can calculate the total number of books read by adding the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also adding the number of books Ahmed read (225):

Total books read = 300 + 150 + 225
Total books read = 675

Therefore, the total number of books read is 675.

The final answer is: $\boxed{675}$"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we can break down her earnings into two components: the hourly wage and the daily bonus.

First, we calculate her total hours worked. On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, resulting in a total of 20 hours. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, totaling 4 hours. Therefore, her total hours worked over the two days is 20 + 4 = 24 hours.

Next, we calculate her earnings from the hourly wage. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings from the hourly wage is 24 hours * $15 per hour = $360.

Additionally, Tanya earns a daily bonus of $5 for each day she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday and 2 classes on Wednesday, she earns the bonus on both days. Therefore, her total bonus is $5 * 2 = $10.

Finally, we add her earnings from the hourly wage and the bonus to determine her total earnings. $360 + $10 = $370.

The final answer is: $370"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of vanilla scents sold as V and the number of fruity scents sold as F. We are given that there are 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available. The sales data indicates that 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents were sold.

We can express the total sales for each type of scent as follows:

V = 5 (number of vanilla scents sold) * 4 (number of vanilla scents available) = 20
F = 2 (number of fruity scents sold) * 8 (number of fruity scents available) = 16

Now, we can find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

Difference = V - F = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, the company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the selling price per ear of corn, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the selling price per ear of corn as x. Given that Bennet wants to make a total of $135 and he has already earned $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each, we can set up the following equation:

20(3) + 25x = 135

Simplifying the equation, we get:
60 + 25x = 135

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:
25x = 75

Dividing both sides by 25, we find:
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total available time for leisure activities. Given that she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, the total available time is 12 hours.

Subsequently, we can calculate the time spent on reading and video games. It is given that she reads for 3 hours. The remaining time is then 12 - 3 = 9 hours. Since she spends 1/3 of this remaining time playing video games, the time spent on video games is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total available time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total available time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the fraction of pencils given to Brandon, which is 1/2 of the initial 50 pencils. This can be represented as 50 * (1/2) = 25 pencils. The remaining pencils after this transfer are 50 - 25 = 25.

Next, we calculate the fraction of the remaining pencils given to Charlie, which is 3/5 of the 25 pencils. This can be represented as 25 * (3/5) = 15 pencils. The remaining pencils after this transfer are 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total duration Jack is away from home, we must consider the time spent traveling to and from the museum. 

Given that the distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack's speed is 75 miles per hour, we can calculate the time taken for the round trip as follows:

Time taken for the round trip = Total distance / Speed
Time taken for the round trip = 2 * (150 miles / 75 mph)
Time taken for the round trip = 4 hours

Additionally, Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total duration he is away from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

Total duration away from home = Time taken for the round trip + Time spent at the museum
Total duration away from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total duration away from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after Henry assembles the toys, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the assembly. 

The number of wheels needed for the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars (57) by the number of wheels per car (4), resulting in 228 wheels. Similarly, the number of wheels required for the motorcycles can be found by multiplying the number of motorcycles (73) by the number of wheels per motorcycle (2), yielding 146 wheels. 

The total number of wheels needed is the sum of the wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles, which is 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box (650) to find the number of wheels left: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left is 276."
"To determine the amount to be paid after a 20% discount, we can employ the concept of percentage decrease. The discount amount can be calculated as 20% of the original price, which is $1000. 

The discount amount is given by 0.20 * $1000 = $200. 

Subtracting this discount from the original price yields $1000 - $200 = $800.

Therefore, the amount to be paid after the discount is $800."
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we can break down the process into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:

1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

The cost of these series can be found by dividing the cost of individual movies by 6, as Mike can purchase them at this discounted rate. Therefore, the cost of the series is:

$2000 / 6 = $333.33

Next, we need to find the number of movies that are not in series. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of series movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we need to determine the number of older movies, which constitute 40% of the remaining movies. This can be calculated as:

0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies can be found by multiplying the number of older movies by their individual cost:

160 * $5 = $800

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining movies that are neither in series nor older movies. Since there are 400 movies left, and 160 are older movies, we subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these remaining movies can be found by multiplying the number of remaining movies by their individual cost:

240 * $10 = $2400

To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies:

$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of each type of fruit and then summing the results.

The cost of peaches can be calculated as 6 pounds multiplied by the price per pound, which is $2.00. This yields a cost of 6 * $2.00 = $12.00.

Similarly, the cost of plums is found by multiplying the weight (8 pounds) by the price per pound ($1.00), resulting in 8 * $1.00 = $8.00.

Lastly, the cost of apricots is determined by multiplying the weight (6 pounds) by the price per pound ($3.00), which equals 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.

To obtain the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to their vacation spot, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the concept of average speed and time. 

First, we establish the driving speed, which is given as 50 miles per hour. The hiking speed is then calculated as 5 miles per hour less than half of the driving speed. This yields a hiking speed of 20 miles per hour.

Given that the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours, we can calculate the distance covered during this time using the formula: distance = speed × time. Substituting the values, we obtain:

Distance = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can establish variables for their respective scores. Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

Given that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, we can express this as E = A + 5. Additionally, since Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, we can represent this as E = 10A - 40. Lastly, the time it takes for each of them to finish the level is related by the equation A = E + 4.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of E and A.

First, we can substitute the expression for E from the first equation into the second equation: 
10A - 40 = A + 5
9A = 45
A = 5

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the value of E:
E = A + 5
E = 5 + 5
E = 10

Now that we have the values of E and A, we can calculate the difference in their scores:
Difference = A - E
= 5 - 10
= -5

However, since we are calculating the difference in scores, we are interested in the absolute value of the difference. Therefore, the difference in their scores is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as 'x'. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 34

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the usual days and the extra days.

Let's denote the number of times they ride on usual days as 'x'. Since they ride thrice a day for 5 days, the total number of times for these days is 3x. On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2x. 

The total number of times they ride in a week can be represented as the sum of the times for the usual days and the extra days: 3x + 2x = 5x.

However, we are given that they ride thrice a day for 5 days, which implies that 3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now, substituting the value of x into the equation 5x, we get:
5 * 5 = 25

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 25 times a week.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. After adding the new fish to the pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. We know that initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 14 = -11 (this is not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 3 orange fish and 14 white fish, or 14 orange fish and 3 white fish, but we will use the first scenario for our calculation).

Let's use the first scenario: 3 orange fish were taken out, and 14 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish (this is not possible, so we will use the second scenario for our calculation).

Let's use the second scenario: 14 orange fish were taken out, and 3 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 + 14 = 17 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

After adding the new fish to the pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's set up the equation:

17 = 2(1)

Since this equation is not true, we will re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x.

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

17 = 8 + 2x

"To determine the weekly expenditure on gas for Andy's vehicle, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Given that Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, a total of 5 days, and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance per day is 10 miles. 

The total distance traveled in a week can be calculated as follows:

Total distance per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Next, we can determine the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total distance traveled by the vehicle's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

Fuel consumption per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons

Finally, we can calculate the weekly expenditure on gas by multiplying the fuel consumption per week by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon.

Weekly expenditure on gas = Fuel consumption per week * Price per gallon
Weekly expenditure on gas = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly expenditure on gas = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we must first calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount she spent on the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Additionally, Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount she spent on the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is the sum of the amounts spent on the twenties and the quarters, which is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we must first calculate the yield of each type of plant separately and then sum the results.

The yield of tomatoes from 5 plants can be calculated as 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes. Similarly, the yield of eggplants from 8 plants is 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

The total number of fruits can be obtained by adding the yields of tomatoes and eggplants, resulting in 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can begin by calculating the combined proportion of smart and analog TVs sold. The sum of the fractions representing these two types of TVs is 1/4 + 1/8. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 

Converting 1/4 to have a denominator of 8, we get 2/8. Adding 2/8 + 1/8 yields 3/8. This means that 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart or analog.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can calculate the number of TVs that are not OLED by multiplying 40 by 3/8, which equals 15. 

The remaining TVs are OLED, so we subtract 15 from the total to find the number of OLED TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we must first calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

Therefore, John is missing $150.

Final answer: $150"
"To determine the number of logs required to maintain a temperature of at least 32 degrees within the house, we must first calculate the total temperature drop from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees to the nighttime temperature of 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Given that each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, we can calculate the required number of logs as follows:

Number of logs = Total temperature drop / Heat provided per log
= 12 degrees / 5 degrees per log
= 2.4 logs

Since we cannot burn a fraction of a log, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house remains at a temperature of at least 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to calculate the number of groups that participated in the scavenger hunt. Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups with seashells as:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we can apply the principles of set theory and basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, the train has 172 passengers. At the first stop, 47 individuals disembark, and 13 new passengers board. This results in a net change of -34 passengers (47 - 13 = 34). Therefore, the number of passengers after the first stop is 172 - 34 = 138.

At the subsequent stop, 38 more passengers disembark. To find the final number of passengers, we subtract 38 from the number after the first stop: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Final answer: 100"
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to determine the total number of bottle caps collected over the 30-day period. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of bottle caps collected per day (10) by the number of days in the month (30). 

Total bottle caps = 10 * 30 = 300

Next, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap, which is $0.25.

Total money made = Total bottle caps * Value of each cap
Total money made = 300 * $0.25
Total money made = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we must consider her regular hourly wage and the special hourly rate for additional hours worked. 

Her regular hourly wage is $20 per hour, and she worked 8 hours at this rate, resulting in earnings of 8 * $20 = $160. 

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. Thus, her earnings for these hours are 3 * $30 = $90.

The total earnings for the day are the sum of her earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first establish the number of male lions. Given that the number of male lions is half the number of female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of female lions + Number of male lions + Number of lion cubs
= 12 + 6 + 14
= 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. Given that the original price is $40 and the jeans are 25% off, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

The discounted price of the jeans is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the original price:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount = $40 - $10 = $30

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

Amount left over = $50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the discounted jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. The initial number of employees is 200, and the company hires 20 new employees every month. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20.

The total number of employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

- Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
- Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
- Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3 (number of months), a1 = 200 (initial number of employees), and an = 260 (total number of employees after 3 months).

S = 3/2 * (200 + 260) = 3/2 * 460 = 690

However, this represents the total number of employees, not the total salary paid. To find the total salary paid, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid = 690 * $4000 = $2,760,000

However, this is the total salary paid for the 3 months, not the total salary paid after 3 months. To find the total salary paid after 3 months, we multiply the monthly salary by the number of months:

Total salary paid after 3 months = $2,760,000 * 3 = $8,280,000

The final answer is: $8,280,000"
"To determine the total duration of the caroling schedule, we must consider the time allocated for each song. The choir plans to perform ""Deck the Halls"" twice, with a duration of 150 seconds per instance, resulting in a total of 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. Additionally, they will sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, with a duration of 240 seconds.

The total caroling time can be calculated by summing the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we must first calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply these by the number of hours worked.

Initially, Billy's hourly wage was $10. Following a 2-month raise of $0.50 per hour, his wage increased to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Upon his first anniversary, he received a further raise of $1.00 per hour, resulting in a wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, which was $10. Therefore, her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. As she also works 20 hours, her total earnings can be calculated as $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 - $10.50 * 20 = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread, which is 3 times the cost of a single loaf, i.e., 3 × $2 = $6. 

Next, we calculate the total cost of 2 bagels, which is 2 times the cost of a single bagel, i.e., 2 × $1 = $2.

The difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels can be found by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread, yielding $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can express this as:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11

Given that Pierson scored 278 points, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we must consider the contributions of both students and teachers. 

First, we calculate the number of trees planted by the students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Given that each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we can start by calculating the total number of stuffed animals she currently possesses. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of each type of stuffed animal:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Given that the desired percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can express this as an equation:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side yields:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides results in:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = -10.67

However, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a stuffed animal, we must re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to recognize that the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side gives:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides yields:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 results in:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming activity into two distinct periods. 

First, we calculate the total hours she played in the initial 2 weeks. Since she played for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days, the total hours played during this period can be found by multiplying the daily duration by the number of days: 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours she played in the subsequent week. She played for 2 hours per day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

The cumulative hours played so far can be obtained by adding the hours played in the initial 2 weeks and the hours played in the subsequent week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the distance separating the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Let's consider the initial distance between the cars to be 'x' miles. Since the first car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, it covers a distance of 60 miles in 1 hour. The second car, traveling at a speed of 70 miles per hour, covers a distance of 70 miles in 1 hour.

When the second car passes the first car, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour. This relative speed represents the rate at which the distance between the cars decreases.

To find the time it takes for the second car to catch up to the first car, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed. However, since we are interested in the distance between the cars after 2 hours, we can directly calculate the distance covered by each car in 2 hours and find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it covers a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it covers a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

The distance between the cars after 2 hours is the difference in the distances they traveled: 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must first calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is the sum of the diamond's cost and the gold's cost. 

The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the total cost is $600 + $300 = $900. 

To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we must first calculate the number of students who passed in each grade level and then compute the overall pass rate.

The pass rates for the third, fourth, and fifth grades are given as 340 out of 500, 40 out of 100, and twice that of the fourth grade, respectively. We can calculate the number of fifth-grade students who passed as 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:

Total students who passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 80 (fifth grade) = 460
Total students in the school = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

With these values, we can calculate the overall pass rate as follows:

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is 46."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of glass chips available. Since each bag contains 72 chips and Milo has two bags, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Given that it takes 12 chips to create one square inch, we can calculate the total number of square inches by dividing the total number of chips by 12: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo desires a mosaic that is 3 inches tall, we can find the length of the mosaic by multiplying the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 inches.

Therefore, Milo can create a mosaic that is 36 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. 

Four students each consumed 1.5 quarts of tea, resulting in a total consumption of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Additionally, 16 students each consumed 2 quarts of tea, leading to an additional 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of consumption.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities, which is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Given that there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea at the party can be calculated as 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the party is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has. Initially, he had 100 candies and subsequently ordered an additional 100, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, he sold 150 candies, which reduces the total number of candies he has to 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can model the situation using exponential growth. The number of students doubles at the end of every month, which can be represented by the formula:

Number of students at the end of the month = Initial number of students * 2^(month number)

Given that there are 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2^1 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2^2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2^3 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2^4 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2^5 = 320.

The number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May can be found by subtracting the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = 320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that Felix's earnings for the week amount to $105 and his charge per branch is $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch.

Total earnings ÷ cost per branch = total branches
$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can then calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Total branches ÷ 7 days = average branches per day
420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ a systematic approach by calculating the total number of petals for each type of flower and then accounting for the dropped petals.

First, we calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Next, we sum the total number of petals for each type of flower: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we must subtract the total number of petals dropped from the total: 101 - (5 + 6 + 4 + 7) = 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the number of S'mores John and DeSean can make with the remaining marshmallows, we must first calculate the total number of marshmallows available after the initial drop.

The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows, and 3 were lost, resulting in 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows remaining.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is 32.

John and DeSean have already made a combined total of 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. To find out how many S'mores each can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

**Answer:** 16"
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we must first calculate the time each individual spent playing and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack's friend who is significantly worse than him as x. Since Jack plays for 4 hours (240 minutes), his friend plays for half the time, so their time is 120 minutes. The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so their time is 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. We also know that the total time played is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 120 + 360 + x = 240

Combine like terms:

2x + 480 = 240

Subtract 480 from both sides:

2x = -240

Divide by 2:

x = -120

Since time cannot be negative, this indicates an error in the initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can rephrase the problem as follows: Jack plays for 240 minutes, his friend plays for 120 minutes, and the better friend plays for 360 minutes. The total time played is 240 + 120 + 360 = 720 minutes. Since Jack's time is 240 minutes, the combined time of his two friends is 720 - 240 = 480 minutes. 

Now, we can find the time each friend played:

Time for the better friend = 360 minutes
Time for the worse friend = 120 minutes

Since the better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, we can set up the equation:

Time for the worse friend = 0.5 * Time for the better friend
120 = 0.5 * 360
120 = 180

This indicates an error in the initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can rephrase the problem as follows: Jack plays for 240 minutes, his friend plays for 120 minutes, and the better friend plays for 360 minutes. The total time played is 240 + 120 + 360 = 720 minutes. Since Jack's time is 240 minutes, the combined time of his two friends is 720 - 240 = 480 minutes. 

Now, we can find the time each friend played:

Time for the better friend = 360 minutes
Time for the worse friend = 120 minutes

Since the better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, we can set up the equation:

Time for the worse friend = 0.5 * Time for the better friend
120 = 0.5 * 360
120 = 180

This indicates an error in the initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can rephrase the problem as follows: Jack plays for 240 minutes, his friend plays for 120 minutes, and the better friend plays for 360 minutes. The total time played is 240 + 120 + 360 = 720 minutes. Since Jack's time is 240 minutes, the combined time of his two friends is 720 - 240 = 480 minutes. 

Now, we can find the time each friend played:

Time for the better friend = 360 minutes
Time for the worse friend = 120 minutes

Since the better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, we can set up the equation:

Time for the better friend = 1.5 * Time for Jack
360 = 1.5 * 240
360 = 360

This equation holds true, indicating that the initial assumption was correct.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

Cost for Jack = Time for Jack * Cost per game
= 240 * $0.25
= $60

Cost for the better friend = Time for the better friend * Cost per game
= 360 * $0.25
= $90

Cost for the worse friend = Time for the worse friend * Cost per game
= 120 * $0.25
= $30

Total cost = Cost for Jack + Cost for the better friend + Cost for the worse friend
= $60 + $90 + $30
= $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of salt, citrus zest, and fragrance as x, and the amount of oil as 2x, as per the problem statement.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it consists of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest is x, and the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of fragrance is also x. Therefore, the equation representing the total volume is:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 2

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the amount of oil used. Since the amount of oil is 2x, we multiply 2 by 2:

2x = 2 * 2
2x = 4

Therefore, the amount of oil used in the salt scrub is 4 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then summing them.

The cost of 3 goats can be calculated as 3 times the cost of a single goat, which is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.

Similarly, the cost of 2 cows can be calculated as 2 times the cost of a single cow, which is $1500. Hence, the total cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is the sum of the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows, which is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already possesses. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of chocolate and toffee cupcakes. 

Chocolate cupcakes = 8
Toffee cupcakes = 40
Total cupcakes already has = 8 + 40 = 48

Next, we can calculate the number of additional cupcakes required by subtracting the total cupcakes already available from the total number needed. 

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Additional cupcakes needed = Total cupcakes needed - Total cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to acquire 15 more cupcakes to meet the required quantity."
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we establish the initial number of cars Joe possesses. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe's initial car count can be calculated as 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells. 20% of his cars are sold, which equates to 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Subsequently, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. As he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can employ a straightforward division approach. 

Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from external organizations, the remaining amount must have been contributed by the students. This can be calculated as follows:

$175,000 (total amount raised) - $50,000 (amount raised by organizations) = $125,000 (amount raised by students)

Now, to find the individual contribution of each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student contributed $6,250 to the charity.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we must first calculate the time she spent walking on the second day. Given that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we can express this as:

Time walked on the second day = (1/2) * Time walked on the first day
Time walked on the second day = (1/2) * 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 4 hours

The total time walked in two days is the sum of the time walked on each day:
Total time = Time walked on the first day + Time walked on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the parking lot had 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter exited the classroom for lunch, half of the cars had departed. This means that 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars left the parking lot.

To find the number of cars remaining, we subtract the number of cars that departed from the total: 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of tasks per cycle (5) by the number of cycles per day (30) and then multiplying the result by the number of days in a week (7).

Total tasks per day = 5 cycles/day * 30 cycles/cycle = 150 tasks/day
Total tasks in a week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Given that each task pays $1.20, we can calculate John's weekly earnings by multiplying the total number of tasks by the pay per task.

Weekly earnings = Total tasks in a week * Pay per task
Weekly earnings = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260."
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we must first establish the points scored by each player in each game.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Sasha in both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can calculate the total tins of each type by multiplying the respective quantities of packages by the tins per package.

The total number of tins of cat food is 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

The total number of tins of dog food is 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Magic Cards each individual possesses. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Given that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, we can express Smendrick's card count as 3x. Furthermore, Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so her card count can be represented as 3x + 12.

The total number of cards is 341, which allows us to set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we obtain:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have determined PJ's card count, we can calculate Becca's card count by substituting x into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca's card count = 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca possesses 153 Magic Cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:
1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P / 3

Substituting the values of B and P in terms of G, we get:
B = 2G = 2(5) = 10
P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
Y = P / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs of each color:
Total = G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we must consider the total cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive. The cost of shipping the book can be calculated as the sum of the weight-based charge and the mileage-based charge.

The weight-based charge is $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, resulting in a charge of 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The mileage-based charge is $0.08 per mile, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles, resulting in a charge of 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's original purchase price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost to determine the amount she will lose: $3.00 - $24 = -$21. However, since Milly cannot lose money, we must consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. Therefore, the amount she will lose is $32 - $24 = $8.

The final answer is $8."
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent. She acquired $100 from her father, bringing her initial total to $40 + $100 = $140.

Subsequently, she purchases two pairs of jeans at $30 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she purchases a bag for $20, further increasing her total expenditure to $60 + $20 = $80.

To find the amount of money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from her initial total: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the production of each week. 

Let's denote the production for the first week as W1, the second week as W2, and the third week as W3. We are given that W1 = 8,000 bars. The production for the second week is stated to be half of the first week, so W2 = W1 / 2 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. 

The production for the third week is three times as much as the first week, so W3 = 3 * W1 = 3 * 8,000 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is W1 + W2 + W3 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we must first calculate the time she dedicates to each activity and then sum these values.

Britany records 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes, or 1.2 hours.

In addition to recording, Britany spends 2 hours per week writing amateur songs for TikTok. She also spends 15 minutes per day, six days a week, doing her makeup before filming. This equates to 90 minutes per week, or 1.5 hours.

The total time spent on TikTok per week is the sum of these two values: 1.2 hours + 1.5 hours = 2.7 hours.

To find the total time spent on TikTok in a month, we multiply this weekly value by the number of weeks in the month: 2.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 10.8 hours.

The final answer is: 10.8"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we must first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items separately.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we subtract the number of standard items from the number of additional items for each category:

- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the cost of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the amount saved by Eva, which is given as $20. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, his total savings can be calculated as $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings to find the additional amount Roy has saved. This can be computed as 0.4 * $30 = $12.

Finally, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to obtain Roy's total savings. Therefore, Roy's savings amount to $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we must first establish the relative lifting capacities of each individual. We are given that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay. Furthermore, Saskay can lift a mountain twelve times higher than Pompei, who can lift a mountain of 1 inch.

We can express the relative lifting capacities as follows:

- Naruto's capacity = 10 * Kagiyami's capacity
- Kagiyami's capacity = 4 * Saskay's capacity
- Saskay's capacity = 12 * Pompei's capacity

Substituting the last equation into the second one, we get:

Kagiyami's capacity = 12 * 12 * Pompei's capacity
Kagiyami's capacity = 144 * Pompei's capacity

Now, substituting this into the first equation:

Naruto's capacity = 10 * 144 * Pompei's capacity
Naruto's capacity = 1440 * Pompei's capacity

Since Pompei can lift a mountain of 1 inch, Naruto can lift a mountain of 1440 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

1440 / 12 = 120 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain of 120 feet.

The final answer is 120."
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can employ the fundamental principles of kinematics. Given that Mason's speed is constant at 8 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the total time elapsed.

The total time elapsed is the sum of the initial 4 hours and the subsequent 6 hours, resulting in a total time of 10 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total distance of 80 miles."
"To determine the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway, we first need to establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can express the speed of a turtle as 1/2 times the speed of a kangaroo.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the speed of a turtle as 't'. We know that the speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so t = k/2.

We are given that three kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we can express this as 3k * 18 = distance. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up an equation:

3k * 18 = 4t * 18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3k = 4t

Substituting t = k/2 into the equation, we get:

3k = 4(k/2)
3k = 2k
k = 6

Now that we know the speed of a kangaroo (k = 6), we can find the speed of a turtle (t = k/2):

t = 6/2
t = 3

Now that we know the speed of a turtle, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = distance/speed
Time = 54/3
Time = 18

Therefore, it will take four turtles 18 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as 'x'. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes made by Rory can be represented as 'x + 20'. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes made by Jada can be represented as '2(x + 20)'.

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes, we get:

Rory's dishes = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes = 2(20 + 20) = 80

Now, we can calculate the total number of dishes made by adding the individual amounts:

Total number of dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can analyze the given information and set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that she has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom agreed to give her $80. The total amount she has is the sum of these two amounts, which is x = 150 + 80.

However, this is not the entire story. Erika also traded in her old laptop, which reduced the price of the new laptop by $200. The new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400. Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation:

x + 230 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 230 from both sides of the equation:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices available. 

Given that a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, we can calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately. 

Let's denote the number of large apples as L and the number of small apples as S. We are given that L = 3 and S = 5. 

The total number of slices from the large apples is 5L = 5(3) = 15 slices. 
The total number of slices from the small apples is 3S = 3(5) = 15 slices.

The total number of slices available is the sum of the slices from the large and small apples, which is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can employ a simple proportional analysis. Given that the farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk per day from 3 cows, we can establish a ratio of milk production per cow.

Let's denote the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day as 'x'. We can set up a proportion to relate the current milk production to the desired milk production:

5 liters / 3 cows = 25 liters / x cows

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5x = 25 * 3
5x = 75
x = 75 / 5
x = 15

Therefore, the farmer needs 15 cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used. 

Let's start by finding the length of each glue stick that is not used. For the first glue stick, 5/6 of the original length is used, so the remaining portion is 1/6. The original length of the glue stick is 12 mm, so the length of the remaining portion is (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm.

For the second glue stick, 2/3 of the original length is used, so the remaining portion is 1/3. The original length of the glue stick is 12 mm, so the length of the remaining portion is (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm.

For the third glue stick, 1/2 of the original length is used, so the remaining portion is 1/2. The original length of the glue stick is 12 mm, so the length of the remaining portion is (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 12 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Next, we assess the total amount of funds at Gabriel's disposal: $5,000 (from his weekend work) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.

Finally, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items to determine the remaining amount he needs: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still requires $5,600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we must first calculate the total amount she paid using the four $20 bills. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of bills by the value of each bill: 4 * $20 = $80.

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount paid to find the change: $80 - $70 = $10.

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount he expended. Craig initially possessed two twenty-dollar bills, yielding an initial total of $40. He then acquired six squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in an additional expenditure of $12. Furthermore, he purchased three packs of water balloons at $3 each, adding $9 to his total expenditure. The combined total spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Subsequently, we subtract the total amount spent from Craig's initial funds to determine his remaining balance: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

$19"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of socks and dishes each individual has. Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes he has as D. We are given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this as D = 2S.

We are also given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, which can be expressed as P = 2S, where P represents the number of socks Peter has. Furthermore, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can express this as P = D/2.

We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, which allows us to solve for S:
D = 2S
60 = 2S
S = 60/2
S = 30

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of socks Peter has:
P = 2S
P = 2(30)
P = 60

We can also find the number of dishes Peter has:
P = D/2
60 = D/2
D = 60 * 2
D = 120

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total = P + S + D
Total = 60 + 30 + 120
Total = 210

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given:
T = 20
M (math only) = 5
E (English only) = 8

We are tasked with finding M (total good at math), which can be calculated using the formula:

M = M (math only) + B (both)

First, we need to find the number of students good at both math and English (B). This can be determined by subtracting the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students:

B = T - (M (math only) + E (English only))
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can calculate the total number of students good at math by adding the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M = M (math only) + B (both)
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we must first calculate the total available time for performances. The total concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Each group's performance time, including setup and teardown, is 10 minutes. Therefore, the time allocated for performances is 120 minutes - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform by dividing the available performance time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available performance time / Time taken by each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

The correct answer is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we calculate the interest earned each year:
Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount for each year:
Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = $750 + $225 = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we must first establish the number of white shirts without collars. Given that half of the white shirts possess collars, we can calculate this as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts without buttons. This can be obtained by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the two quantities by subtracting the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of trays that can be filled with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. This can be represented as:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Subsequently, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the selling price per tray, which is $2.5. This yields:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer's total earnings from selling the eggs on the trays will be $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of goats remaining in each farm after the sales.

Let's denote the initial number of goats in Farm X as x and the initial number of goats in Farm Y as y. We are given that x = 55 and y = 45.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, resulting in a new number of goats in Farm X, denoted as x - 10. He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which equates to 2 * 10 = 20 goats. Therefore, the new number of goats in Farm Y is y - 20.

We can express the number of goats left in each farm as follows:

Number of goats left in Farm X: x - 10
Number of goats left in Farm Y: y - 20

Substituting the given initial values, we get:

Number of goats left in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45
Number of goats left in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:

Total number of goats left = (x - 10) + (y - 20)
= (55 - 10) + (45 - 20)
= 45 + 25
= 70

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

Given that James purchases 2 pairs of shoes per month and spends $2640 on shoes annually, we can calculate the average cost per pair by dividing the total annual expenditure by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

The total annual expenditure is $2640, and the number of pairs purchased in a year is 2. 

Average cost per pair = Total annual expenditure / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

Therefore, James pays $1320 on average for each pair of shoes."
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs of each type of food. The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we must account for the $2 discount per basket. Therefore, the total cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 - 3 * $2 = $54.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $54 = $129.

The total cost is $129."
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms that constitutes one-half of the total. This can be achieved by dividing the total number of rooms by 2.

Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three components: the number of homes built in each year.

In the first year, the town will construct 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years by summing the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the ages of the individuals involved as variables. Let's use 'x' to represent the age of the person in question, 'x + 3' for the brother's age, 'x - 2' for the sister's age, and '3(x + 3) - 1' for the mother's age.

The sum of their ages is given as 87, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Nevertheless, in this context, the exact value of x is not necessary for determining the person's age. The solution can be expressed as an integer.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to purchase, we can employ the concept of division and consider the remainder. 

Given that each pack contains 8 glue sticks and he wants to distribute 2 glue sticks to each of the 27 students, we can set up the following equation:

8x ≥ 27 * 2

where x represents the number of packs.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x ≥ 54

To find the minimum number of packs required, we divide both sides by 8:

x ≥ 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student receives 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy at least 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Initially, the river receives 4000 gallons of water. On the second day, the flow doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the flow increases by 6000 gallons, leading to a total of 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14000}$"
"To model the spread of the plague, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. The number of infected individuals on each day can be represented by the equation:

N(t) = N0 * (r^t)

where N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t, N0 is the initial number of infected individuals (10 in this case), r is the growth rate (6 in this case), and t is the number of days.

Given the initial conditions, we can calculate the number of infected individuals on each day as follows:

Day 1: N(1) = 10 * (6^1) = 60
Day 2: N(2) = 10 * (6^2) = 360
Day 3: N(3) = 10 * (6^3) = 2160

Therefore, the total number of infected individuals after three days is 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = 2930.

The final answer is: 2930"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, resulting in a total of 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, which equates to 90% of what Rafaela received. This can be calculated as $800 * 0.9 = $720.

The combined total of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. Since she has three daughters and each received 2 oranges, the total number of oranges given to the daughters is 3 * 2 = 6. Additionally, she gave 3 oranges to her son. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To determine the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber over a 1-year period, we must first establish their individual monthly badge-earning rates.

Claire's monthly badge-earning rate is 1 badge. Consequently, her annual rate is 12 badges.

Amber's badge-earning rate is twice that of Claire's, resulting in a monthly rate of 1/2 badge. Her annual rate is therefore 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy's badge-earning rate is three times that of Claire's, yielding a monthly rate of 3 badges. Her annual rate is 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

The difference in their annual badge earnings can be calculated by subtracting Amber's total from Wendy's total: 36 - 6 = 30 badges.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount raised, we first need to determine the total number of banana bread slices produced. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and operates for 5 hours, the total number of loaves is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, resulting in a total of 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Given that each slice is sold for 50 cents, the total amount raised can be calculated as 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We are informed that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can establish the equation x + 30 = 70.

Solving for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation, yielding x = 40. This indicates that Gretchen possesses 40 silver coins. Consequently, the total number of coins can be calculated by adding the number of gold coins (70) and silver coins (40), resulting in a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we must first calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students. 

Given that there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos distributed can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos distributed = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos distributed = 50 * 10
Total burritos distributed = 500

Next, we must account for the burritos consumed by Mr. George. 

Total burritos consumed = Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George
Total burritos consumed = 20

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total burritos consumed from the total burritos distributed:

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos distributed - Total burritos consumed
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink, we must first establish the number of green and blue cars. Given that the rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as 12 - 2 = 10.

Furthermore, the number of blue cars is three times the number of green cars, resulting in 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

With the total number of cars being 75, we can now calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 (total) - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink is 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x, Anne has as y, and Sofie has as z.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as z = y + 25. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we have y = x - 12.

The total number of books they have together is 85, which gives us the equation z + y + x = 85. We can now substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for x.

Substituting z = y + 25 into the third equation yields (y + 25) + y + x = 85. Simplifying this, we get 2y + x + 25 = 85. Subtracting 25 from both sides results in 2y + x = 60.

Next, we substitute y = x - 12 into the equation 2y + x = 60. This gives us 2(x - 12) + x = 60. Expanding the equation, we have 2x - 24 + x = 60. Combining like terms, we get 3x - 24 = 60. Adding 24 to both sides yields 3x = 84. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 28.

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first establish the weight of the sweet potatoes. Given that the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we must find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots can be calculated as 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we must first calculate the number of boxes required to meet the demand. Given that a three-ounce box yields 10 small jello cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

Number of cups per box: 10
Total cups required: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups
Number of boxes required: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Next, we multiply the number of boxes required by the price per box to obtain the total cost:

Number of boxes required: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's outdoor birthday party.

The final answer is: $15"

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the seller: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we must first calculate his monthly expenditure. Given that Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which amounts to $400 per month, and Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can deduce that Keenan's share is the remaining 40%.

To find Keenan's monthly expenditure, we can calculate 40% of $400. This can be done by multiplying 0.4 by $400, yielding $160.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we can then divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4 to determine his weekly expenditure. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has consumed, we can break down his eating pattern into three distinct intervals.

First, we calculate the fraction of the pizza he consumed on the first day, which is 2/5 of the total 60 pieces. This can be calculated as:

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

On the second day, he consumed a fixed number of 10 pieces.

Next, we need to find the remaining pieces after the first two days. This can be calculated as:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces

Then, we calculate the fraction of the remaining pieces he consumed on the third day, which is 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. This can be calculated as:

(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Finally, we add up the pieces he consumed each day to find the total number of pieces he has eaten:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of each item separately and then summing the results.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda can be calculated as 3 times the cost of a single bottle, which is $21.00. Therefore, the total cost of the soda is 3 * $21.00 = $63.00.

Similarly, the cost of 2 bottles of water can be determined by multiplying the cost of a single bottle by 2, yielding 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the soda and the cost of the water, which is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03, and David intends to acquire 16 bolts. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we can subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David possesses to determine the remaining amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total cost
Remaining amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings per hour by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours worked. 

Earnings per hour = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
= $33 / 3 hours
= $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
= $11 per hour * 12 hours
= $132

The final answer is $132."
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can employ a step-by-step approach. Initially, Paul possesses 52 marbles. His friend presents him with an additional 28 marbles, resulting in a total of 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

However, Paul subsequently experiences a loss of 1/4 of his marbles. This loss can be calculated as 1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles. Consequently, the number of marbles Paul has left is 80 - 20 = 60.

"To determine Amy's total score, we must first calculate the points earned from each type of question and then sum them.

The multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. With 10 multiple-choice questions, she scores 0.8 * 10 = 8 points.

The true/false questions are also worth 1 point each, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. With 20 true/false questions, she scores 0.9 * 20 = 18 points.

The long-answer questions are worth 5 points each, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. With 5 long-answer questions, she scores 0.6 * 5 = 3 points.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we first need to calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell. Given that he has 300 chickens and intends to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias sells the chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

To find the total cost of the chickens, we subtract the desired profit from the total revenue: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Now, to find the cost per chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold: $7000 / 180 = $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that the total number of glasses sold is 32 and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can calculate the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by dividing the total number of glasses by 3.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as x. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold x glasses. We can set up the equation:

x + x + 14 = 32

Combine like terms:

2x + 14 = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:

14 (Julie) - 9 (Micah) = 5

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we must first calculate the cost of each service. 

The cost of the hair service is $400. 

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which can be calculated as 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which can be calculated as 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we can find the total amount Iris spent at the spa by adding the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure together: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we must first calculate the total cost of the new rope and compare it to the amount she has.

The cost of the new rope can be calculated by multiplying its length (20 meters) by the cost per meter ($1.5). This yields a total cost of $30.

Sarah's initial amount of money can be determined by multiplying the length of the rope (20 meters) by the cost per meter ($2). This results in an initial amount of $40.

To find the amount of money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from her initial amount of money. This calculation is as follows:

$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

In 16 years, her age will be x + 16. According to the problem, this age should be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation:

x + 16 = 3x

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x + 16 = 3x
16 = 3x - x
16 = 2x
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age by subtracting her present age from 24 (which is thrice her present age):

24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we must first calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart. 

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12. 

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12. Notably, the cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14, as each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart by adding the individual costs together: $10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48.

Given that Kelly's budget is $65, we can determine the amount of money she has left by subtracting the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert can be expressed as 2x. Additionally, we are given that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the equation representing the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 15 - 15 = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the current number of toys Argo possesses, we must consider the initial quantity and the total amount distributed. 

The initial number of toys Argo had was 200. He then distributed 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find the current number of toys, we must subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial quantity.

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Current number of toys = Initial number of toys - Total toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Therefore, Argo currently possesses 50 toys.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas produced on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we must consider the production quantities for each day. The shop produces 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, the production is twice that of the previous days, resulting in 250 chimichangas.

To calculate the total number of chimichangas produced over the three days, we can add the quantities produced on each day: 125 (Tuesdays) + 125 (Wednesdays) + 250 (Fridays) = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas produced on those three days is 500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we first need to identify the total number of microphones that are unable to fit in pairs. This can be calculated by finding 20% of the total number of microphones.

20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. Therefore, the number of microphones that can fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

To find the number of pairs, we can divide the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of birds, we must consider the distinct groups of birds mentioned in the problem. 

First, we note that there are six birds nesting in the bushes. Then, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds in the bushes. This yields 2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, we are informed that there are three groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we sum the number of birds in the bushes, those flying overhead, and those feeding to obtain the total number of birds: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani consumed 5 cookies. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the initial total.

Let's denote the initial number of cookies as 'x'. The number of cookies remaining is then x - 5.

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we can divide the remaining cookies by 5 to find the number of cookies in each jar.

x - 5 ÷ 5 = (x - 5) / 5

Given that Lani initially baked 55 cookies, we can substitute x = 55 into the equation:

(55 - 5) / 5 = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we can calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be found by multiplying the number of orchids (5) by the number of petals per orchid (5), resulting in 25 petals.

Similarly, the total number of petals on the daisies can be calculated by multiplying the number of daisies (4) by the number of petals per daisy (10), yielding 40 petals.

The difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids can be determined by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to calculate the number of indoor and outdoor plants. 

We know that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. This can be expressed as 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which can be calculated as 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x meters per second. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Equating the two expressions for the whatchamacallit's speed, we have 11x = 121. Solving for x, we find x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second. 

Now that we have determined the speed of the thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, its speed is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of a single carrot, we must first calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, while the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

The combined cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Given that Ellen's total expenditure is $11, we can find the cost of the carrots by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total expenditure. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

The cost of one carrot is $2."
"To determine Mark's current weekly earnings, we must first calculate his new hourly wage following the wage increase. The original hourly wage was $10, and the wage was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, the new hourly wage can be calculated as:

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Next, we need to calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week. Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours worked per week is:

8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Now, we can calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked per week:

$12 (new wage) * 40 hours/week = $480/week

Therefore, Mark's current weekly earnings are $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we must first establish the total earnings from lawn mowing. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Consequently, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Given that Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total earnings from lawn mowing can be expressed as 6x. We are informed that the total earnings from lawn mowing amount to $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

Solving for x, we obtain:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we cannot mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

With x = 13, we can calculate the number of times she mowed each lawn:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total earnings from lawn mowing can be calculated as:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

Now, we subtract the total earnings from lawn mowing from the overall earnings to determine the amount made from lemonade sales:
702 - 80 = 622

The final answer is: 622"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information. 

First, we establish the weights of the individuals involved:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, resulting in Christian's weight being 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, yielding Harry's weight as 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we must first calculate his total monthly earnings. Given that he rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and earns $25 per hour, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked per month = 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours
Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Next, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit:

Total profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Total profit = $750 - $500
Total profit = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit from renting his car is $250."
"To determine the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph, we can establish a relationship between their quantities. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph initially had as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's notebooks as 3x.

Given that Martha ended up with a total of 7 notebooks after purchasing 5 additional ones, we can set up the equation 3x + 5 = 7 to represent the situation.

Solving for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
x = 2/3

Now, we can calculate the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, while Joseph has 2/3 of that amount. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - (2/3) = 7 - 0.67 = 6.33

Therefore, Martha has 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, and Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express Anis's distance as a fraction of Dijana's distance.

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each of Susan's nephews will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by her husband. This involves subtracting the number of cookies taken from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to determine the number each will receive.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can analyze their reading patterns.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as D1 and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as D2. We are given that D1 = 10 and D2 = 13.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so the number of pages Denise read today is D1 + 5. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total pages remain the same as yesterday, which is D2.

We can express the total pages read by Denise and Daniel as follows:

Denise's total pages = D1 + (D1 + 5) = 2D1 + 5
Daniel's total pages = D2

Now, we can calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel:

Difference = Denise's total pages - Daniel's total pages
= (2D1 + 5) - D2
= 2D1 - D2 + 5
= 2(10) - 13 + 5
= 20 - 13 + 5
= 12

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we must first establish the total capacity of the pot in terms of the number of bowls it can fill. Given that the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can express this as a ratio of 4:8, which simplifies to 1:2. This implies that for every one adult bowl, two child bowls can be filled.

Since Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children, the total number of adults is 3. Therefore, the total number of bowls that can be filled is 3 (adults) * 4 (adult bowls per adult) = 12 bowls.

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner.

12 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 8 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 8 bowls left, we can divide the remaining bowls by the number of children to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

8 bowls / 2 children = 4

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times."
"To determine the total amount William spent, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then summing the results.

The cost of 5 notebooks can be calculated as 5 times the cost of a single notebook, which is $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

The cost of a single ballpen is $0.50. To find the total cost of the ballpen, we simply multiply the cost by 1, yielding $0.50.

The total amount William spent is the sum of the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen, which is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total material required, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of small masks as 's' and the number of large masks as 'l'. We are given that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. We want to find the total material needed to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

We can set up the following equations:

For small masks: 2s = total material needed for small masks
For large masks: 2.25l = total material needed for large masks

We are given that s = 20 and l = 8. Substituting these values into the equations, we get:

2(20) = 40 yards (total material needed for small masks)
2.25(8) = 18 yards (total material needed for large masks)

The total material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 40 yards + 18 yards = 58 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can employ the concept of average, which is calculated by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. In this scenario, the total amount spent is $216, and the total number of tickets is 27 (since there are 9 movies, each seen three times).

The average price per ticket can be calculated as follows:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours available in a day, which is 24 hours. 

Harold's daily activities can be broken down into three components: sleep, work, and dog walking. He sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, and walks his dog for 1 hour. 

Given that he works 2 hours less than he sleeps, we can express his work hours as 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Adding the 1 hour spent walking his dog, we have a total of 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours allocated to these activities.

To find Harold's free time, we subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To determine the number of blue and red shoe boxes left, we must first calculate the number of each type of box used. 

The number of blue shoe boxes used is given as 3. The number of red shoe boxes used is 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes. Since there are 9 red shoe boxes in total, we can calculate the number used as follows:

Number of red shoe boxes used = (1/3) * 9 = 3

Now, we can find the number of red shoe boxes left by subtracting the number used from the total:

Number of red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

Similarly, we can find the number of blue shoe boxes left by subtracting the number used from the total:

Number of blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:

Total number of shoe boxes left = 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently possesses, we must first establish the initial number of books he had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate his initial number of books by multiplying Sarah's quantity by 2.

Initial number of books = 2 * 9 = 18

Next, we must account for the 2 books Joseph lost. To find the current number of books he has, we subtract the number of lost books from his initial quantity.

Current number of books = Initial number of books - 2
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total marbles he gave away. 

We know that Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Given that he initially had 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

This implies that Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. Additionally, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. Therefore, the total number of marbles given away is:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we can calculate the number of marbles Dean has left by subtracting the marbles given away from his initial amount:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to establish a relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages.

Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Therefore, Adam's current age is 30.

To determine Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since it is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let x be the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm. Then, the number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm is 2x + 100. 

We know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so we can substitute x = 200 into the equation for Farmer Smith's farm: 2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the acres of both farms: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first establish the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Given that he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 per hour, his hourly rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages.

Multiplying this rate by the number of hours worked (8) yields 40 * 8 = 320 packages completed in an 8-hour workday.

As Colby is paid $0.20 for each package, his total daily earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages completed by the payment per package: 320 * 0.20 = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the total number of bottles of water John drinks during the time spent on sudoku, we must first calculate the total time spent on both puzzles. The normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, while the extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that duration, resulting in 180 minutes. 

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes. 

Number of bottles of water = Total time / 30 minutes = 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Therefore, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water during the time spent on sudoku.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons in the bundle, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We are given that there are 20 red balloons, so R = 20.

We also know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. This can be represented by the equation:

2R + 3Y = 58

Substituting R = 20 into the equation, we get:

2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of tune-ups required for Jon's vehicle, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a 30-day period. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total distance covered in 30 days can be calculated as:

Total distance = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the vehicle requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance traveled by 1000 miles:

Number of tune-ups = Total distance / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon requires 3 tune-ups for his vehicle during the 30-day period.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the hours worked each day and then summing them.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which equates to 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, resulting in 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours worked over the three days can be calculated by adding the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the initial amount of allowance given to Julia and Nadine, we must first calculate the total amount they spent on the items they purchased. The total expenditure on the cake and ice cream is $11 + $7 = $18. Additionally, they spent $6 on 1 dozen balloons.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the initial amount each girl received.

$24 / 2 = $12.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12.

$12"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we must first calculate the initial total. This can be achieved by summing the quantities of each fruit: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Subsequently, we subtract the number of fruits Lola consumed from the total to find the remaining quantity: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we must consider the number of students participating in each sport. 

The number of students playing tennis is given as 6. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we can calculate this as 2 * 6 = 12. 

In addition to these students, there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, resulting in a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students.

To find the overall total, we sum the number of students in each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we can employ the concept of linear multiplication to determine the total number of lollipops sold, followed by the calculation of the profit per lollipop and subsequently the total profit.

First, we establish the number of lollipops sold by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold. This yields 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Next, we calculate the profit per lollipop by subtracting the cost price from the selling price, which results in $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3 per lollipop.

Finally, we calculate the total profit by multiplying the number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop, yielding 300 lollipops * $0.3/lollipop = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can analyze the information provided and calculate the number of each type of pet.

First, we know that Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9. Additionally, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, resulting in 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Furthermore, the number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 fish. Lastly, the number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, resulting in 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we can sum the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we must first establish the daily consumption rate of the two individuals. Abby consumes 2 slices per day, while Josh consumes twice as much, resulting in a daily consumption rate of 4 slices.

The total daily consumption rate is the sum of their individual rates, which is 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

To find the number of days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total daily consumption rate (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression. Since Martha collects one shell per month, the sequence of the number of shells collected forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.

The number of months Martha has been collecting shells can be calculated as the difference between her current age and the age at which she started collecting shells. Given that she is 10 years old, the number of months is:

10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months

Since the sequence is arithmetic, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:

S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term.

In this case, a_1 = 1 (the first shell collected at age 5) and a_n = 120 (the 120th shell collected at age 10). We can calculate the sum of the first 120 terms:

S_120 = 120/2 * (1 + 120)
S_120 = 60 * 121
S_120 = 7260

Therefore, Martha has collected 7260 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7260}$"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first establish the total number of mint tea cups. Given that Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea can be calculated as follows:

Total cups of mint tea = Total cups - Total cups of cinnamon tea
Total cups of mint tea = 27 - 15
Total cups of mint tea = 12

Since the cups are divided into 3 rows, we can determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row by dividing the total number of mint tea cups by 3:

Number of cups of mint tea in each row = Total cups of mint tea / Number of rows
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 12 / 3
Number of cups of mint tea in each row = 4

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we must first establish the total time available for foraging. The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries.

Given that each round trip (down and back up the tree) takes 4 hours, the sloth can make a maximum of 8 / 4 = 2 round trips within the given time frame.

Since the sloth collects the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total desired berries (24) by the number of round trips (2) to find the minimum number of berries collected per round trip.

24 / 2 = 12

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per round trip is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial volume of water transferred from the pool. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial volume of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the remaining volume after 6 days, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

V(t) = V0 * e^(-rt)

where V0 is the initial volume, r is the rate of decay, and t is the time.

In this case, V0 = 5000 gallons, r = 500 gallons/day, and t = 6 days. Plugging in these values, we get:

V(6) = 5000 * e^(-500*6)
V(6) ≈ 5000 * e^(-3000)
V(6) ≈ 5000 * 0.04979
V(6) ≈ 249.9 gallons

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is approximately 249.9 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the maximum number of movies Colby can attend, we must first calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses of popcorn and candy. His monthly allowance is $150, and he has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, resulting in a remaining budget of $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Given that it is a Friday, Colby intends to purchase a ticket, which costs $10. After this purchase, his remaining budget is $134 - $10 = $124.

To find the maximum number of movies he can attend, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of a single ticket. Since it is a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a movie ticket, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can attend 12 movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries, we must first establish the caloric content of each mini pastry. Given that a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, we can calculate the caloric content of the mini versions by taking one-third of the respective values.

The mini cinnamon roll's caloric content is 600 / 3 = 200 calories, and the mini blueberry muffin's caloric content is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries by multiplying the number of each type by their respective caloric contents and summing the results.

Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls = 200 mini rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
Total calories of mini blueberry muffins = 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85,000}$"
"To determine the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we must first calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period. 

The number of Junebugs removed on Monday is given as 39. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Rita removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which equates to 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs for each of those days. Therefore, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156. 

On Thursday, Rita removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs. The total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days, which is 300 / 5 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can employ the fundamental principles of kinematics. The distance traveled by an object is given by the product of its velocity and time. 

Given that the bus travels at a constant velocity of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, we can calculate its total distance traveled as follows:

Distance = Velocity x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Similarly, the car travels at a constant velocity of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, resulting in a total distance of:

Distance = Velocity x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially possessed: 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48.

Next, we subtract this total from the current number of toys: 62. This yields the number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's start by analyzing the given information. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can represent their ages as P, P + 10, and J, respectively. 

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages, so we can write the equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P - P = 10 + J

This simplifies to:

0 = 10 + J

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

45 = (45 + 10) + J

Simplify:

45 = 55 + J

Subtract 55 from both sides:

-10 = J

Since age cannot be negative, this is a problem. However, let's re-examine the original equations.

We can rewrite the first equation as:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the first equation:

J = 35 - P

Substitute J = 35 - P into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (35 - P)

Simplify:

P = 45

Now that we have found Peter's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

45 = (45 + 10) + J

Simplify:

"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the initial and subsequent balloon distributions.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each received 2 water balloons, resulting in a total of 8 balloons. Maria also possessed 1 balloon, bringing the total to 9 balloons.

Subsequently, Maria's mom distributed 3 additional balloons to each of the 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends), yielding a total of 15 new balloons. The total number of balloons can be obtained by adding the initial 9 balloons to the 15 additional balloons, resulting in a grand total of 24 water balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available for display. This can be achieved by summing the boxes donated by the 10 individuals and the existing boxes already in possession of the charity group.

The total number of boxes is given by the expression: 10 * 5 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, the number of tables required can be found by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields: 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already possesses 15 tables. To determine the number of new tables needed, we subtract the existing tables from the total required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated items.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we must first calculate the total distance each individual spits their seeds. 

Zoey's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (40) by the distance each seed is spat (10 feet): 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is found by multiplying the number of seeds (35) by the distance each seed is spat (12 feet): 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both individuals is the sum of their individual distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the comparative financial performance of the two widget production systems, we must first calculate the total output of each machine over a 30-day period.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, resulting in a daily output of 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Consequently, over 30 days, it generates 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

In contrast, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, yielding a daily output of 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. Over the same 30-day period, it produces 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

To assess the financial implications of each option, we must consider the selling price of each widget, which is $6. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200, while the total revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $192,000.

The difference in revenue between the two options can be calculated as $259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200.

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we first need to calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for this period.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost of the additional hours is calculated as 5 hours * 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the amount saved by choosing the extended stay over the 24-hour option, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option."
"To determine the total amount of hay required, we must first establish the individual hay needs of each animal. 

Each goat necessitates 5 pounds of hay. Conversely, each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat requires, which equates to 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

With 15 goats and 12 sheep, the total hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. Similarly, the total hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Consequently, the total amount of hay required is the sum of these two quantities, which is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is 159."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we first calculate his total earnings. Given that he earns $50 per hour and worked for 6 hours, his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total Earnings = Hourly Wage * Hours Worked
Total Earnings = $50 * 6
Total Earnings = $300

Subsequently, John spends $50 on gas, resulting in:

Remaining Funds = Total Earnings - Gas Expenses
Remaining Funds = $300 - $50
Remaining Funds = $250

Furthermore, he purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, leading to an additional expenditure of:

Pencil Expenses = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Pencil Expenses = 5 * $10
Pencil Expenses = $50

The updated remaining funds can be calculated as:

Updated Remaining Funds = Remaining Funds - Pencil Expenses
Updated Remaining Funds = $250 - $50
Updated Remaining Funds = $200

John's intention is to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with:

Final Remaining Funds = Updated Remaining Funds - Bank Deposit
Final Remaining Funds = $200 - $100
Final Remaining Funds = $100

To determine the number of 25-dollar pens John can purchase, we divide the final remaining funds by the cost of a single pen:

Number of Pens = Final Remaining Funds / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = $100 / $25
Number of Pens = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can calculate the total number of letters in each of their word lists separately and then sum them up.

Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in his words is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This implies that the total number of letters in his words is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total number of letters in Craig's words and his brother's words: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: $\boxed{650}$"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total, we can calculate the total number of children by multiplying the number of children per row by the number of rows.

Total number of children = Number of children per row * Number of rows
Total number of children = 8 * 7
Total number of children = 56

Therefore, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we must first calculate the total number of bottles distributed to the students. With 29 pupils in the class, and each student receiving 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given away is:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we consider the teacher's available coupons, which amount to 9 in number, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. Thus, the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Subtracting the number of bottles distributed to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain yields:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To determine the total cost incurred by Patty for the repair, we must consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts. The fixed charge is a flat rate of $40, while the labor cost is calculated based on the number of hours worked, which in this case is 2.25 hours. The labor cost is therefore $35 per hour, or part thereof, which equates to $35 * 2 = $70. The remaining fractional part of the hour is $0.25, which is also charged at $35 per hour, resulting in an additional $8.75. 

The total labor cost is then $70 + $8.75 = $78.75. Adding the fixed charge of $40 and the cost of parts, which is $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Labor cost + Fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine James' financial outcome, we must first calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of CDs by the cost per CD: 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount, which is 40% of the total cost. This can be computed as 0.4 * $150 = $60.

The total cost after the discount is then $150 - $60 = $90.

However, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of 5 * $40 = $200.

To determine James' financial outcome, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost after the discount: $90 - $200 = -$110.

Therefore, James was out of money by $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from selling the root crops, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the value of each type of crop and then summing the results.

The value of the yams can be calculated as 6 yams * $1.5 = $9. This represents the total revenue generated from the sale of yams.

Similarly, the value of the sweet potatoes is obtained by multiplying the quantity (10 sweet potatoes) by the price per unit ($2), yielding $20.

Lastly, the value of the carrots is determined by multiplying the quantity (4 carrots) by the price per unit ($1.25), resulting in $5.

To obtain the total earnings, we add the values of the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops is $34."
"To determine the total time James spends on the entire journey, we can break down the problem into distinct segments.

First, we calculate the time James spends swimming at a constant pace of 2 miles per hour. The total distance he needs to cover is 20 miles, so the time taken for this segment is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Next, James swims 60% of the total distance, which is 12 miles. The time taken for this segment is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests on an island for half the time he spent swimming. Therefore, the rest time is:

Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Finally, James swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken for this segment is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time James spends on the entire journey is the sum of the times for each segment:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be expressed as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation 7x - 40 = 70 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get:
7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110
x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

However, since the number of loaves must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a loaf. Therefore, the bakery had approximately 15 loaves of bread last Friday.

Now, to find the number of loaves the bakery has, we can multiply the number of loaves Sam had by 7 and subtract 40:
7 * 15 - 40 = 105 - 40 = 65

The bakery has 65 loaves of bread.

The final answer is 65."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net gain of 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

Subsequently, her teacher rewarded her with an additional 5 stickers for her efforts in helping her classmates. This increase in sticker count can be calculated by adding 5 to the previous total: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

Therefore, Jasmine now possesses 13 stickers.

**Answer: 13**"
"To determine Cayley's total commission, we must first calculate the commission earned from each newspaper and then sum these amounts.

The commission for the New York Times can be calculated as 6 copies * 10% * $5. This is equivalent to 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3.

Similarly, the commission for the Wall Street Journal is found by multiplying 10 copies by 8% and $15, which equals 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12.

The total commission is the sum of these two amounts, which is $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine Leo's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be expressed as M = 0.5L. Additionally, we know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

We are also given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

Substituting D = 26 into the equation M = D - 5, we can solve for M: M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Now that we have the value of M, we can substitute it into the equation M = 0.5L to solve for L: 21 = 0.5L.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get L = 21 * 2 = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42 years old."
"To determine the number of points Azibo scored, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D, respectively.

We are given that B = D + 10 and B = A + 20. Additionally, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so B + A + D = 45.

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get:

(D + 10) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2D + A + 10 = 45

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2D + A = 35

We also know that A = B - 20. Substituting B = D + 10 into this equation, we get:

A = (D + 10) - 20
A = D - 10

Substituting A = D - 10 into the equation 2D + A = 35, we get:

2D + (D - 10) = 35

Combine like terms:

3D - 10 = 35

Add 10 to both sides:

3D = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

D = 15

Now that we know D = 15, we can find A:

A = D - 10
= 15 - 10
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must consider the physical properties of the paper and the book's dimensions. Given that the paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, the effective number of pages per inch is 2.

The book's thickness is 1.5 inches. Multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book yields the total number of pages:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To determine the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we must first calculate the total duration of time he was stapling reports. The time interval from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM can be broken down into two segments: 4 hours (from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) and 11 hours (from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM).

The total duration is then calculated as the sum of these two segments: 4 hours + 11 hours = 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total duration in minutes is 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Given that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by dividing the total duration in minutes by 15: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 60 reports during the specified time period."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we must first calculate her usual sleep duration. Given that she typically goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., her usual sleep duration can be calculated as follows:

10 p.m. to 6 a.m. = 8 hours
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to attend to her bathroom needs. Therefore, we must subtract these 5 minutes from her total sleep duration:

480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Additionally, Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We can calculate the duration of this sleepwalking episode as follows:

2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we add the duration of the sleepwalking episode to her adjusted total sleep duration:

475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{498}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial quantities of measuring cups and spoons. We are informed that Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which equates to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he initially possesses. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of measuring cups by 2/3:

(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan's total number of utensils can be determined by adding the number of measuring cups and measuring spoons:
24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied, the initial number of occupied beds can be calculated as:

1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Next, we need to account for the daily admissions due to the coronavirus outbreak. With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

50 * 14 = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the additional admissions:

200 + 700 = 900 beds

To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity:

1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 7 work emails, we subtract this from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find the number of non-work emails sent to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the ages of Shawna and Aliya. We are informed that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. This implies that Shawna's age can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can then calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we must first calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported. This can be achieved by multiplying Courtney's reported number by 0.20.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

0.20x = 48 - x

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

0.20x + x = 48

Combine like terms:

1.20x = 48

Now, divide both sides by 1.20:

x = 48 / 1.20

x = 40

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of basketballs brought to practice, we can establish a relationship between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls = 2x. Furthermore, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2(2x) = 4x.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by each individual. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Total balls = Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls + Jordan's balls
Total balls = 2x + x + 4x
Total balls = 7x

Since we know that Jason carried 2 balls, we can substitute 2 for 2x:
2 = 2x
x = 1

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the total number of balls:
Total balls = 7x
Total balls = 7(1)
Total balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we can start by calculating the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). Therefore, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 4 * (number of holes dug on the fourth day) = 116. Solving for the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we get:

number of holes dug on the fourth day = 116 / 4
number of holes dug on the fourth day = 29

However, this is the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day, not the number of holes dug on the fourth day. To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

number of holes dug on the fourth day = 116 - 29
number of holes dug on the fourth day = 87

The final answer is 87."
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we can utilize the information provided to establish an equation. Let's denote the number of corn chips each of the two individuals (Amora and Lainey) received as 'x'. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than the others, the number of corn chips Collins received can be expressed as (x + 15).

We are given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x + 15) = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

3x + 15 = total number of corn chips

We also know that the total number of corn chips is 225. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x + 15 = 225

Subtract 15 from both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of corn chips each of the two individuals received, we can calculate the total number of corn chips:

Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total cost of the travel, we can calculate the additional amount required for the travel expenses, which is 50% of the cost of the supplies. 

Given that the cost of supplies is $400, we can find 50% of this amount by multiplying it by 0.5. 

50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

The total cost of the travel is then the sum of the cost of supplies and the additional amount for travel expenses.

Total cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given that the total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339, which can be expressed as:

A + S + X = 339

Additionally, we know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be represented as:

X = S + 5

Furthermore, we are informed that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than four times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as:

S = 4A - 13

By substituting the expression for X into the first equation, we obtain:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Substituting S = 4A - 13 into the equation yields:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combining like terms, we get:

9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation results in:

9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9, we find:

A = 40

Now that we have determined A, we can solve for S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13:

S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:

Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Next, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can employ the concept of vector addition. The bird's displacement can be represented as the sum of three vectors: the displacement due to the initial southerly flight, the displacement due to the subsequent northerly flight, and the displacement due to the final southerly flight.

Let's denote the initial southerly displacement as vector A, the northerly displacement as vector B, and the final southerly displacement as vector C. The magnitude of each vector can be calculated as follows:

The magnitude of vector A (southerly displacement) is 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles.

The magnitude of vector B (northerly displacement) is 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles.

The magnitude of vector C (southerly displacement) is 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles.

Since the bird's final position is the sum of the displacements, we can find the net southerly displacement by subtracting the northerly displacement from the southerly displacements:

Net southerly displacement = |A| - |B| + |C| = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had, we must consider the various sources of brownies she received throughout the day. 

Initially, Greta made a batch of 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. This serves as the foundation for our calculation.

In addition to the brownies she made, Greta received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party. This brings the total to 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

Furthermore, her friends presented her with 4 dozen (48) brownies at her home. Combining this with the previous total, we have 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.

However, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were consumed. To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate the age of Nani's brother, who is twice Nani's age. Since Nani is 8 years old, his brother's age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Next, we find the age of Nani's sister, who is 25% younger than Nani. This can be calculated as 75% of Nani's age, which is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of the three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of the family members is the sum of their individual ages: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time required to string all the racquets, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time spent on each type of string and then summing these values.

Let's denote the number of racquets to be strung with synthetic gut as S, polyester as P, and hybrid as H. We are given S = 3, P = 5, and H = 4. The respective stringing times are 15 minutes for synthetic gut, 22 minutes for polyester, and 18 minutes for hybrid sets.

The total time (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = (S * t_S) + (P * t_P) + (H * t_H)

where t_S, t_P, and t_H represent the stringing times for synthetic gut, polyester, and hybrid sets, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

T = (3 * 15) + (5 * 22) + (4 * 18)
T = 45 + 110 + 72
T = 227 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. The cost of the first two phones is straightforward, as each costs $600. Therefore, the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

For the remaining phones, we observe that each subsequent phone is half the price of the initial phone. Consequently, the cost of each of the remaining phones is $300. Since there are three remaining phones, the total cost for these phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

To obtain the overall cost, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to Carlton's team size.

This results in Zeke's team having 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Subsequently, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in each team: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be found by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can find the total number of slats required by multiplying the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she initially possessed. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we need to account for the oranges she distributed to her mom and sister. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes given away by the number of oranges per box: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

We then subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total to find the number of oranges remaining: 240 - 40 = 200 oranges.

Since she sold the remaining oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both India and the USA, we must first establish the number of states in each country. The USA has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to this result yields 29 states in India.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA (50) to the number of states in India (29). This gives us a total of 50 + 29 = 79 states.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The sum of the costs of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has saved $14, which is short of the total amount required. To find the additional amount he needs, we subtract the amount saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he must work by dividing the amount needed by his hourly wage: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'r'. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can express this relationship as an equation:

r + 10 = 30

Solving for 'r', we find that Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we can calculate the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries (60) and the number of cherries Robert has (30) from Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Finally, to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we must first establish the quantities of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day. 

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. According to the problem, G = 10 and A = G - 4. Therefore, A = 10 - 4 = 6.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. The number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is A - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day. The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box. Therefore, the total earnings for Saturday are 10 * $6 + 6 * $15 = $60 + $90 = $150. The total earnings for Sunday are 15 * $6 + 2 * $15 = $90 + $30 = $120.

The total earnings for the two days are $150 + $120 = $270.

The final answer is: $270"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total number of hours she will be outside. Given that she will be outside for 4 hours a day over an 8-day period, the total number of hours can be calculated as follows:

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, the total number of bottles required can be found by dividing the total number of hours by the volume of a single bottle (8 ounces). 

Total bottles = Total hours / 8 ounces per bottle
Total bottles = 32 hours / 8 ounces
Total bottles = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the prices of the red and blue cars, we can utilize the concept of percentages. Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can express this relationship as:

Red car price = Blue car price - (40% of Blue car price)

Let's denote the price of the blue car as B. The price of the red car can then be represented as B - 0.4B.

We are also given that the price of the blue car is $100. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Red car price = $100 - 0.4($100)
= $100 - $40
= $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that Emil is currently 19 years old, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, which can be expressed as the equation 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 yields D = 48.

Additionally, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, leading to the equation 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2 results in B = 12.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their current ages by adding E, D, and B together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of beads given by each individual: 
- Her mother provided 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which equates to 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice the amount her mother gave, resulting in 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we sum the beads from each source: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we must first calculate the cumulative amount of crawfish he caught over the three days. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught is the sum of the amounts caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can determine the number of servings by dividing the total amount by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of students in each group. 

First, we find the number of football players, which is 20% of the total class size. This can be calculated as 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players, which is 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members, which is 25% of the remaining students. This can be calculated as 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early. This is 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we must first establish the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, we can calculate the average shoe size by adding the sizes of their boots and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of plants required to fill the flower bed, we must first convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then calculate the total space occupied by the plants and the spaces between them.

The length of the bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. To accommodate the plants and the spaces between them, we need to subtract the space between each plant from the total length. Each plant occupies 12 inches, and there is 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by the plants and the spaces between them is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now, we can calculate the number of plants that can fit in the bed by dividing the total space by the width of each plant: 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to purchase 109 - 17 = 92 additional flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother consumes in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that Edgar's brother eats half the amount of pretzels Edgar does, we can calculate his daily pretzel intake by dividing Edgar's daily consumption by 2.

Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption = 18 pretzels / 2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily amount by 7.

Edgar's brother's weekly pretzel consumption = 9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother consumes 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then summing the results.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as the product of the number of baskets, the number of petunias per basket, and the cost per petunia: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = $45.00.

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be determined by multiplying the number of baskets, the number of vines per basket, and the cost per vine: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = $25.00.

The total cost is then the sum of these two values: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil utilized for the sunflowers and carnations. 

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds, and for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for both is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Now, we subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil purchased: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we must first calculate her monthly savings for shoes. This can be achieved by finding 25% of her monthly income, which is $2,000.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can then multiply her monthly savings by 12 to find the total amount she sets aside for shoes annually.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we can divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes, which is $1,000, to determine the number of shoes she can purchase.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the problem into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking.

First, we need to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp peeled per minute
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp cooked per minute
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 3
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we add the times together to get the total time:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
Total time = 15 + 30
Total time = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the final temperature, we must consider the net cooling effect of the air conditioner. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. 

First, we calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in an additional cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is therefore 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Next, we consider the warming effect of the room. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour, and it was off for 2 hours. Therefore, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have elapsed since Bill's dad first saw the comet as x. At that time, Bill's dad was 30 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can express the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x.

We are given that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age = 3 * (Bill's dad's age at the time)

We know that Bill's age at the time he saw the comet is 90 years old. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

90 = 3 * (30 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 = 90 + 3x

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

0 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

This implies that no years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was 3 times his father's age at that time, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet by subtracting 75 from Bill's age at the time he saw the comet:

90 - 75 = 15

However, this represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. To find Bill's age at the time his dad saw the comet, we subtract 15 from Bill's age at the time he saw the comet:

90 - 15 = 75

Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when his dad saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each check type and calculate the annual frequency.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once per month, yielding another 12 checks per year. Furthermore, he writes two checks to the church per month, which translates to 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes four checks to the pest and lawn service quarterly, resulting in 16 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we sum the individual frequencies: 12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 16 (pest and lawn service) = 64 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we must first establish the total number of flights it undertakes in a day. Given that the second plane's 44 trips constitute half of the first plane's total, we can deduce that the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 flights.

Since the first plane's flights are divided into three-quarters going to Greece and the remaining one-quarter split between France and Germany, we can calculate the number of flights to France as follows: 88 - 66 (flights to Greece) = 22 flights to France.

Therefore, the first plane makes 22 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls, we can analyze the problem by breaking it down into individual components.

Let's denote the length of Tobias' howl as T, Chikote's howl as C, and Igneous' howl as I. We are given the following information:

1. T = 20 seconds
2. C = 2T
3. I = T + C

We can substitute the value of C from equation (2) into equation (3) to get I = 2T + T = 3T.

Now, we can express the combined length of their howls as the sum of the individual lengths: T + C + I = 20 + 2T + 3T = 20 + 5T.

Substituting the value of T, we get 20 + 5(20) = 20 + 100 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we must first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents. 

Adam's mother provided $6, and his father provided twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The combined amount from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Given that the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To determine the age of Wilfred, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

Given that the total age of the children is 20, we can express this as an equation: H + W + 3 + 4 = 20, where 3 and 4 represent the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, respectively.

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children, which is 4. Therefore, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we can express this as H = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can substitute the value of H into the first equation: 10 + W + 3 + 4 = 20. Simplifying this equation, we get W + 17 = 20. Solving for W, we find that W = 20 - 17 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we must first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected thus far. This can be found by adding the initial $500 collected from his neighbors to the $1500 collected from the online fund, yielding a total of $2000.

However, it is crucial to note that Walter's friend will subsequently contribute $200 to the cause. Therefore, the adjusted total amount collected becomes $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Given that Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times the amount donated by everyone else, we must calculate three times the adjusted total amount collected. This equates to 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of individuals in the church, we must first calculate the total number of cookies available for distribution. With 100 guests contributing 15 cookies each, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Since the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church, we can calculate the number of cookies allocated to the church as 1500 / 2 = 750.

Given that each individual in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies allocated to the church by the number of cookies per individual: 750 / 15 = 50.

Therefore, there were 50 individuals in the church."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we must first establish the ratio of adult to child portions. Let's denote the number of child portions as x. Consequently, the number of adult portions is 2x, as each adult receives a slice twice the size of each child.

Given that the total number of portions is 6, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Simplifying, we obtain:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 2

Thus, the number of child portions is 2, and the number of adult portions is 2x = 4.

Since each adult portion is twice the size of each child portion, let's denote the size of a child portion as y. Consequently, the size of an adult portion is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all portions, which is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we divide the size of the adult portions by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, each adult receives 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of hours Doctor Jones will have available to update his records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

The time spent on inpatient rounds can be calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients (9) by the time spent per inpatient (20 minutes), resulting in 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. 

Similarly, the time spent on appointments can be calculated by multiplying the number of appointments (10) by the time spent per appointment (30 minutes), resulting in 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of these two values: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available (9 hours) to determine the time available for updating records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we must consider the total time required for each stage of the process. The time spent on each activity is as follows:

- Preparation and mixing: 20 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

The total time spent on these activities is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. Converting this to hours and minutes, we obtain 3 hours.

To find the latest start time, we subtract the total time from the desired serving time. The desired serving time is 5:00 pm. Subtracting 3 hours from 5:00 pm yields 2:00 pm.

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can approach this problem algebraically. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Given that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars sold by both of them can be represented as 3.5x + 4.5x. Combining like terms, we get 8x.

We are also given that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the equation 8x = 64.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Thus, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we must consider both the rental costs and the costs associated with the students' lessons. 

First, we calculate the weekly rental cost, which is $25 per session multiplied by the number of days the studio is rented per week, resulting in $75 per week. Since there are four weeks in a month, the total monthly rental cost is $75 * 4 = $300.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost of the students' lessons. With 10 students and a cost of $1.50 per student per session, the weekly cost is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Multiplying this by the number of weeks in a month, we get $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is the sum of the monthly rental cost and the monthly cost of the students' lessons, which is $300 + $60 = $360.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360.

$360"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can set up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so her total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x. 

For Peter's equation: x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha's equation: x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha. The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the female porcupine population is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
= (3/5) * 50
= 30

Next, we need to find the total number of new porcupines born in a year. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120. 

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year):

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12
= 1440

Finally, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines to find the total population after a year:

Total population after a year = Initial population + Total new porcupines
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To determine the volume of the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by V = lwh, where l represents the length, w represents the width, and h represents the height (or depth, in this case).

Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = 14 x 25 x 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we can proceed with this calculation:

Total gallons = V x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Finally, to determine the cost of filling the pool, we can multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we must first establish the quantities of each color. We are given that there are 9 red sticks. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. Furthermore, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which results in 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

The total number of sticks can be calculated by summing the quantities of each color: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can employ the fundamental concept of distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

Let's calculate the distance each individual traveled. Matteo's distance can be found by multiplying his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours), resulting in 220 miles. Similarly, Shandy's distance is obtained by multiplying her speed (45 miles per hour) by the time she traveled (10 hours), yielding 450 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between the two can be determined by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance, which gives us 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into distinct categories.

First, we note that the school enrolls 3000 students in total. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which equates to 1500 students. Furthermore, one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, resulting in 375 male students in this age group. Consequently, the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, comprising 1500 students. Notably, one-half of the students under 16 are male, yielding 750 male students in this age group.

To calculate the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students in this age group from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Similarly, to determine the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students in this age group from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of female students by summing the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps each individual can run, we can establish a linear relationship between the variables based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of laps Bethany can run as B, Trey as T, Shaelyn as S, and Quinn as Q. We are provided with the following relationships:

1. B = 10 (Bethany's laps)
2. T = B + 4 (Trey's laps in terms of Bethany's laps)
3. S = T/2 (Shaelyn's laps in terms of Trey's laps)
4. Q = S - 2 (Quinn's laps in terms of Shaelyn's laps)

Substituting the expressions for T and S into the equation for Q, we get:

Q = (B + 4)/2 - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for Q:

Q = (10 + 4)/2 - 2
Q = 14/2 - 2
Q = 7 - 2
Q = 5

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps:

Difference = B - Q
= 10 - 5
= 5

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can analyze the work done by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

Let's denote the amount of water Wanda pumps on the first day as x. Then, Ms. B pumps 3x/4 gallons on the first day. On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3x gallons, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 * (3x/4) = x/4 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day is x + 3x/4 = 7x/4 gallons. On the second day, the total amount of water pumped is 2x/3 + x/4 = 11x/12 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7x/4 + 11x/12 = (21x + 11x)/12 = 32x/12 = 8x/3 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 8x/3 gallons.

However, we know that Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. This implies that x = 4500. Substituting this value into the expression for the remaining water, we get 18000 - 8(4500)/3 = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save up the down payment, we can calculate her total weekly earnings and then divide the required savings by this amount.

Janet's hourly wage is $25, consisting of $10 from wages and $15 from tips. Her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly earnings = (Wage + Tips) * Hours worked
Weekly earnings = ($10 + $15) * 40
Weekly earnings = $25 * 40
Weekly earnings = $1000

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save up the down payment:

Number of weeks = Required savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $2000 / $1000
Number of weeks = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective price and summing the results.

The cost of peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of pears is 4 * $0.75 = $3
The cost of kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The cost of apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we can calculate the remaining amount by subtracting the total spent from his initial amount: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this result is not feasible in the context of the problem, as it implies a negative amount. 

Given the initial amount is $10 and the total spent on other fruits exceeds this amount, we must re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-examine the calculation: 

The total spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25. Since Jamaar only has $10, he cannot afford any additional fruits. 

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is 0.

Final answer: 0"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, each containing 60 pieces, she retained a total of 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The remaining number of packs she gave away is 15 - 2 = 13 packs. Given that each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

To find out how many pieces each of her 10 friends received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. The price increase is 5% of the original price each year, which can be represented as a geometric progression.

The formula for exponential growth is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t

where P(t) is the price after t years, P0 is the initial price, r is the annual growth rate (as a decimal), and t is the number of years.

In this case, P0 = $120, r = 0.05, and t = 3. Plugging in these values, we get:

P(3) = $120 * (1 + 0.05)^3
= $120 * (1.05)^3
= $120 * 1.157625
≈ $139.74

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were designated for selfies only, we can calculate the number of selfies by multiplying the number of albums allocated for selfies by the number of pictures per album.

3 * 9 = 27

Similarly, as 2 albums were designated for portraits only, we can calculate the number of portraits by multiplying the number of albums allocated for portraits by the number of pictures per album.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of reading. This rate can be calculated as the ratio of pages to minutes, which is 3 pages / 10 minutes. To find the time it takes James to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion and solve for the unknown time.

Let's denote the time it takes James to read 18 pages as 't'. We can set up the proportion as follows:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / t minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3t = 18 * 10

Simplifying the equation, we have:

3t = 180

Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:

t = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. A total of 24 guests opted for early checkout, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. Then, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, the number of guests who checked in is twice the number of those who opted for late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, the number of guests who checked in is 2 * 15 = 30. Therefore, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-in is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

The final number of guests at the hotel is 98."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday, which is triple the number he picked on Wednesday. This can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Next, we add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

Therefore, John has a total of 22 bananas."
"To determine the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions.

Given that 40% of the 60-question quiz are easy, we can calculate the number of easy questions as follows:
Number of easy questions = 60 * 0.4 = 24

The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so we calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
Number of average and difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
Easy questions = 24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
Average and difficult questions = 18 * 0.5 = 9

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
Total points = 18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x and the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

Given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, we can express the price of a large stuffed animal as 3 * 4 = 12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y. Therefore, the total amount earned can be represented by the equation:

12y + 8(2y) = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12y + 16y = 120

Combine like terms:

28y = 120

Divide both sides by 28:

y = 120/28

y = 30/7

y = 4.29 (approximately)

Since y represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can round down to the nearest whole number as we cannot sell a fraction of an item. Therefore, Teresa sold 4 large stuffed animals.

To find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we multiply the number of large stuffed animals by 2:

2y = 2 * 4 = 8

So, Teresa sold 8 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total daily consumption by summing the individual daily consumption of the man, his wife, and their son. This yields a total of 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches consumed in a week is 11 * 7 = 77.

The family consumes 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total revenue. Her cookie sales generated $80, while her cupcake sales yielded $240. Thus, her total revenue is $80 + $240 = $320.

Subsequently, Suzanne distributed $20 to each of her two sisters, resulting in a total of $20 * 2 = $40.

To find her remaining earnings, we subtract the amount distributed to her sisters from her total revenue: $320 - $40 = $280.

Therefore, Suzanne has $280 left from her earnings.

Final answer: $280"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward approach by subtracting the total number of eggs found by the twins from the overall total and then subtracting the number of eggs that were not found by the friends.

Let's denote the total number of eggs as T, the number of eggs found by the twins as W, and the number of eggs not found by the friends as N. We are given that T = 100, W = 60 (since the twins found 30 each), and N = 10.

The number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated as follows:

Eggs found by friends = T - W - N
= 100 - 60 - 10
= 30

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we must first establish the individual daily ore production rates for each type of pickaxe.

Let's denote the daily ore production rate of a dwarf with bare hands as $b$, the iron pickaxe as $i$, and the steel pickaxe as $s$. We are given that $b = 12$ pounds per day.

We also know that the iron pickaxe increases the production rate by a factor of 2, so $i = 2b = 2 \times 12 = 24$ pounds per day.

Furthermore, the steel pickaxe increases the production rate by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe, which can be expressed as $s = 1.5i = 1.5 \times 24 = 36$ pounds per day.

With 40 dwarves, the total daily production rate with steel pickaxes is $40s = 40 \times 36 = 1440$ pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily production rate by the number of days in a month, which is 30. Therefore, the total amount of ore mined in a month is $1440 \times 30 = 43200$ pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the number of sandwiches and the corresponding price. 

Let's denote the unknown price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

(2 sandwiches) / $3 = (4 sandwiches) / $6 = (8 sandwiches) / x

Using the first two ratios, we can solve for x:

(2/3) = (4/6)

Cross-multiplying yields:

12 = 8x

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 12/8
x = 1.5

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $1.50.

"To determine the monthly payment, we must first calculate the remaining amount owed after Tom utilizes the proceeds from the sale of his old bedroom. This can be achieved by subtracting the sale amount from the initial cost of the bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Next, we calculate the monthly payment by applying the 10% interest rate to the remaining amount owed. This can be computed as follows:

Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom must pay $200 per month."
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the balloon count.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, resulting in 10 red balloons lost. This leaves Sally with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Subsequently, a loud noise caused her to release half of the remaining yellow balloons, which equates to 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. Consequently, the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - 6 = 6.

Upon approaching the school, Sally discovered 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. This equates to 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

To calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we sum the remaining red, yellow, and added blue balloons: 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can employ the concept of complementary probability. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: (1) the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, and (2) the substitute teacher comes in.

The probability of the normal teacher coming in is 50%, or 0.5. The probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher is 60%, or 0.6. Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The probability of the substitute teacher coming in is also 50%, or 0.5. The probability of not getting an extension from the substitute teacher is 60%, or 0.6. Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher coming in and not getting an extension is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can add the probabilities of these two scenarios: 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6.

The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is 0.6. To find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: 40%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of seats taken by the graduates and faculty. 

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we can calculate the total number of seats taken as follows:

Total seats taken = 950 (graduate seats) + 300 (faculty seats) = 1250

Now, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to determine the remaining seats available for distribution among the graduates:

Remaining seats = Total capacity - Total seats taken
= 6000 - 1250
= 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can calculate the number of tickets each graduate would receive by dividing the remaining seats by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Remaining seats / Number of graduates
= 4750 / 950
= 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can establish a relationship between the number of large, medium, and small beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We also know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we are told that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, which implies that S = M/3.

Substituting the value of M, we get S = 150/3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we must first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her daily expenses. 

Her total daily income is $15, and her daily expenses are $3. Therefore, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she worked for 6 hours a day for 3 days, the total number of hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find her hourly wage, we divide the total jury pay by the total number of hours worked: $12 / 18 hours = $0.67 per hour.

The final answer is $0.67."
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we can employ the concept of arithmetic addition. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the books by multiplying the number of books (3) by the cost per book ($16), yielding 3 * 16 = $48.

"To determine the total time required for Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given parameters. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of bottles that can be accommodated along the driveway. Given that the driveway's width is 24 feet and a bottle is placed every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between bottles
Total number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle
Total number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to make 7 movements to reach the last bottle. Each movement takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time required can be calculated as:

Total time = Number of movements * Time per movement
Total time = 7 * 5 seconds
Total time = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

Given that there are 40 apples in one box and Uncle Franky has two boxes, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can calculate the number of packs by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack: 80 ÷ 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to purchase meat, we must first calculate the total cost of the cheese she acquired. 

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she purchased 2 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 2 x $11 = $22. Similarly, the cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she purchased 3 pounds, yielding a total cost of 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is the sum of these two amounts, which is $22 + $18 = $40.

Given that Amor initially possessed $50, we can calculate the amount of money she will have left by subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to purchase meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to determine the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Given that he received $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, the total amount of money lost is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, we calculate Jim's increased income after graduating, which is triple his pre-college income of $25,000. Therefore, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school, which is $200,000 (lost money) + $50,000 (loans) = $250,000.

To find the time required to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by Jim's new income: $250,000 / $75,000 = 3.33 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 3.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric required, we must first calculate the dimensions of the comforter. Given that the bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width, and the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric can be calculated as follows:

Length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
Width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

The area of the fabric can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. Therefore, the total area of the fabric required is:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Thus, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. This is equal to one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday, plus 17. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Tuesday's delivery = (1/5) * Monday's delivery + 17
= (1/5) * 425 + 17
= 85 + 17
= 102

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. This is equal to twice the number delivered on Tuesday, plus 5. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Wednesday's delivery = 2 * Tuesday's delivery + 5
= 2 * 102 + 5
= 204 + 5
= 209

Now, we can find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday by adding the individual daily deliveries:

Total delivery = Monday's delivery + Tuesday's delivery + Wednesday's delivery
= 425 + 102 + 209
= 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total cost of the catering, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total cost of each type of salad and then summing the results.

The cost of the chicken salad can be calculated as the product of the number of guests who ordered it (10) and the price per serving ($6.50), yielding a total of 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is found by multiplying the number of guests who ordered it (6) and the price per serving ($6), resulting in 6 * $6 = $36.

The total cost of the catering is then the sum of these two values, which is $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To determine the average amount lost by Johnny, we must first calculate the total amount lost over the three races. 

In the first race, Johnny lost $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This can be expressed as $2 * $5 + $1 = $11. 

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This can be calculated as 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

The total amount lost is the sum of the losses in each race: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To determine the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward multiplication principle. Given that each country has 5 cities with a population of 1000 individuals, we can calculate the total population by multiplying the number of countries (26) by the number of cities per country (5) and then by the population of each city (1000).

This can be represented as:

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Population per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we must first convert their heights to a common unit, in this case, inches. Xavier's initial height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, resulting in a new height of 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier can be calculated by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the share of the first person, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, which gives us the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtracting 160 from both sides yields:

3x = 1760

Dividing both sides by 3 results in:

x = 1760/3
x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person's share is $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total hours worked as follows:

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day.

Given that the team worked for 3 weeks, we can multiply the daily hours by 7 days:
9 hours/day * 7 days = 63 hours

Now, we can divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours

Therefore, each painter worked 15.75 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is then x + 4, and the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combining like terms yields:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we have found x, we can determine the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we can utilize the concept of exponential decay. Given that the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per annum, we can model this situation using the formula for exponential decay:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- A(t) is the value of the car at time t
- A0 is the initial value of the car (in this case, $20,000)
- r is the annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21 as a decimal)
- t is the number of years

We are interested in finding the value of the car in 2010, which is 3 years after the initial purchase. Plugging in the values, we get:

A(3) = 20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * (0.79)^3
A(3) = 20,000 * 0.631519
A(3) = 12,638.38

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,638.38.

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the proportion of non-Spanish books. 

First, we note that half of the 50 books are written in English, which equates to 25 books. Additionally, 10% of the total 50 books are written in German, resulting in 5 books. 

The total number of non-Spanish books can be calculated by adding the English and German books, yielding 25 + 5 = 30 books. 

Since the total number of books is 50, the number of Spanish books can be found by subtracting the non-Spanish books from the total, giving us 50 - 30 = 20 books.

Therefore, the number of Spanish books in the library is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

The total distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York, is approximately 1955 kilometers. Given that Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers, we can calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the distance driven from the total distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 km - 325 km
= 1630 km

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the daily water consumption in gallons. Given that Ingrid consumes 8 cups of water daily, and there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate her daily water intake in gallons as follows:

8 cups/day ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day

Next, we multiply this daily consumption rate by the number of days (30) to obtain the total water consumption in 30 days:

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, the train has 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more individuals board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people disembark, and 100 people board the train. The net change in the number of passengers is 100 - 50 = 50, so the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people disembark, resulting in a total of 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we must calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

The cost of the tank top is $10. The cost of the running shorts is $5 more than the tank top, which is $10 + $5 = $15. The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price, resulting in a discounted price of $48 / 2 = $24. Additionally, Alison purchased a package of athletic socks for $8, from which she had a coupon for $2 off. Therefore, the discounted price of the socks is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear by summing the costs of each item: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required. Given that each tile has an area of 1 square foot and the kitchen floor has a total area of 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed can be found by dividing the total area by the area of each tile.

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Next, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost. 

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To determine James' yearly insurance cost, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident. The normal monthly cost is $120, and the increase is 60% of this amount.

The increase can be calculated as 0.6 * $120 = $72. Adding this to the normal cost, we get a new monthly cost of $120 + $72 = $192.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. Therefore, the yearly cost is $192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of loads per week and then multiplying it by the number of weeks in a year.

Given that Greg washes 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week, and his laundry machine can accommodate 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we can establish that he performs 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

With 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads can be calculated as 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

The total number of movies watched in one weekend is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4. Therefore, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. 

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. The following year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which equates to 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. 

To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can sum the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the duration for which 720 grams of cat food will last, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food, we can calculate the total daily consumption as 2 * 60 grams = 120 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption (120 grams) to obtain the number of days it will last:

720 grams / 120 grams per day = 6 days

Therefore, the cat food will last 6 days."
"To determine the total number of slices consumed, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'x'. Given that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's consumption as x + 3. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, her consumption can be represented as 2x.

We are also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we find that x = 7. This implies that Jake ate 7 slices.

Substituting x = 7 into the expressions for Becky's and Silvia's consumption, we get:

Becky's slices = 7 + 3 = 10
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7 = 14

The total number of slices consumed is the sum of their individual consumptions:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is 31."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we must consider the various expenses incurred. 

First, we calculate the cost of the cast, which is a fixed amount of $200. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the visit, taking into account the hourly rate of $300 and the duration of the visit, which is 0.5 hours (since it is a 30-minute visit). Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

We also need to account for the cost of painkillers, which is $4 per pill, and the doctor likely prescribed 30 pills. Thus, the total cost of painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Additionally, there is a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking, and the hourly rate for parking is $6. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit by adding the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the total number of emails that require a response and then multiply it by the number of days in the work week.

First, we need to find 20% of the total number of emails James receives in a day. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

The number of emails that require a response is then 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by the number of days in a work week (5) to find the total number of emails responded to in a week. 

64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we can employ a systematic approach to calculate the number of classes for each day and subsequently sum them up.

Let's denote the number of classes that visited on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, Thursday as Th, and Friday as F. We are given the following information:

M = 32
T = 2M
W = 3M
Th = 30
F = 25

We can express T and W in terms of M:
T = 2M = 2(32) = 64
W = 3M = 3(32) = 96

Now, we can substitute the values of T and W into the equation for the total number of classes:
Total = M + T + W + Th + F
Total = M + 2M + 3M + 30 + 25
Total = 6M + 55

Substituting the value of M:
Total = 6(32) + 55
Total = 192 + 55
Total = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To calculate the average score, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, we have four scores: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we sum these scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of scores, which is 4. This yields an average score of 380 / 4 = 95.

Therefore, the average score across the four tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we must first calculate the number of pizzas consumed by each group. 

The glee club consumed 70% of 20 pizzas, which can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas. 

The football team consumed 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas consumed is the sum of the pizzas consumed by both groups, which is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we must first calculate the number of small and big coupons being sent out. Given that Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, we can express the number of big coupons as 2 times the number of small coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing each small coupon is 5 cents, and each big coupon is 15 cents. To find the total cost of postage, we multiply the number of each type of coupon by its respective cost and add the results together.

Total cost of small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents
Total cost of big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Total cost of postage = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
24500 / 100 = 245 dollars

The total cost of postage is $245."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Mark then consumed 4 of these, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Subsequently, Sidney ordered an additional 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches can be calculated by multiplying the total number of sub sandwiches by the number of meatballs per sub sandwich: 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that were unable to deliver the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * Total number of trucks dispatched
= 1/4 * 20
= 5

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons
= 100 tons

To find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered, we subtract the amount that could not be delivered from the total amount:
Total amount of fertiliser delivered = Total amount of fertiliser dispatched - Amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered
= 20 trucks * 20 tons
- 100 tons
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we must first calculate the total amount of butter required. Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, the total amount of butter needed is 6 pounds.

The grocery store is currently offering a promotion where a customer can buy one pound of butter and receive half off the second pound. This effectively reduces the cost of 2 pounds of butter to $4.00. To find the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed. 

Dividing the total amount of butter required (6 pounds) by 2 yields 3 sets. Since each set costs $4.00, the total cost can be calculated as 3 sets * $4.00 per set = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we must first calculate the number of guests attending. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people declined the invitation. 

The total number of guests is therefore 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

The rental fee for the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, and an additional $6 is charged for each guest beyond the initial 20. 

The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost of the party is the sum of the initial rental fee and the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To determine the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 30.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $30. 
1/4 * 30 = 7.5

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $30. 
1/3 * 30 = 10

The total amount of money they spent is 7.5 + 10 = $17.5.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had.
2x - 17.5 = 2(30) - 17.5
= 60 - 17.5
= $42.5

The two of them have $42.5 left."
"To determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey, we must first establish the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys. 

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats per day as x. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the second monkey's daily consumption can be expressed as x + 4. 

The total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys is then 7(x + x + 4), which simplifies to 14x + 28.

We know that the total weekly consumption of all three monkeys is 315 bananas. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

14x + 28 + y = 315

where y represents the number of bananas the third monkey eats per day.

Solving for y, we get:

y = 315 - 14x - 28
y = 287 - 14x

Since x must be a non-negative integer (as it represents the number of bananas the first monkey eats per day), we can find the value of x by dividing the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys by 14:

14x = 315 - 287
14x = 28
x = 2

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation for y:

y = 287 - 14(2)
y = 287 - 28
y = 259

However, this is the total weekly consumption of the third monkey. To find the daily consumption, we divide by 7:

y = 259 / 7
y = 37

The final answer is 37."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we must consider the information provided. It is given that he completed half of a 500-piece puzzle and then finished another 500-piece puzzle within the same hour.

Let's analyze the situation: Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle, which equates to 250 pieces. Then, he completed another 500-piece puzzle. 

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we can simply add the number of pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750."
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we must first calculate the total cost of the roses. The cost of 15 roses can be found by multiplying the number of roses by the cost per rose, which is $2. This yields a total cost of $30. Additionally, we are informed that a dozen roses (12 roses) costs $15. Therefore, the cost of the remaining 3 roses can be calculated by multiplying the number of roses by the cost per rose, resulting in $6. The total cost of the roses is then $30 + $6 = $36.

Next, we must calculate the change Jenny will receive. She has 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. The change can be found by subtracting the total cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has: $25 - $36 = -$11. However, since she cannot receive a negative amount of change, we must re-evaluate the situation.

Given that the florist only accepts quarters for change, we can calculate the maximum amount of change she can receive by dividing the total amount of money she has by the value of a quarter ($0.25). This yields $25 / $0.25 = 100 quarters. However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Jenny will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses, and the question's assumption that she has enough money is incorrect."
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the revenue generated from each product category and subsequently summing these values.

First, we calculate the total revenue from milkshakes: 6 units * $5.50 per unit = $33.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from burger platters: 9 units * $11 per unit = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the total revenue from sodas: 20 units * $1.50 per unit = $30.

By summing these individual revenues, we arrive at the total amount of money Terry makes: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we can break down the train schedule into segments and calculate the time elapsed between each train's arrival and departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, resulting in a 20-minute gap between its arrival and departure. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival. The second train stays for 5 minutes, resulting in a 5-minute gap between its arrival and departure. The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, which is 65 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival. Since the third train leaves immediately upon arrival, its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 65 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 85 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival.

To calculate the total waiting time, we sum the time elapsed between each train's arrival and departure:

- Waiting for the first train: 20 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 40 minutes
- Waiting for the third train: 65 minutes
- Waiting for the fourth train: 85 minutes

Total waiting time = 20 + 40 + 65 + 85 = 210 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the number of weeks required for Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can employ a simple division approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far by multiplying the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Next, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find the number of toothpicks still needed.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we divide the number of toothpicks still needed (80) by the number of toothpicks saved per week (10) to determine the number of additional weeks required.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we first need to calculate the original price of the watch. 

Let's denote the original price as P. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:

0.75P = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

P = $2000 / 0.75
P = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the sale price as:

Sale price = 1.20 * P
Sale price = 1.20 * $2666.67
Sale price = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = P - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since the discount is negative, it indicates that the sale price is higher than the original price. To find the percentage discount, we can divide the absolute value of the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (|Discount| / P) * 100
Percentage discount = ($533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount ≈ 20%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is approximately 20%.

Final answer: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each spring generates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish production per hour for a single spring is 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

Multiplying this rate by the number of hours, we find that a single spring produces 240 jellyfish in 4 hours. 

Considering that 5 springs are operating at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish produced in 4 hours can be calculated by multiplying the number of jellyfish produced by a single spring in 4 hours by the number of springs. Therefore, 5 springs would create 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can utilize algebraic manipulation. Let's denote Binkie's score as 'x'. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This relationship can be expressed as:

Frankie's score = 2x + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

2x + 15 = 90

To solve for x, we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 90 - 15
2x = 75

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

Now that we have found Binkie's score, we can substitute this value back into the original equation to find Frankie's score:

Frankie's score = 2x + 15
Frankie's score = 2(37.5) + 15
Frankie's score = 75 + 15
Frankie's score = 90

Therefore, Frankie's score is 90."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we must consider the total distance traveled and his walking speed.

Given that James' home is 4 miles from the store, and he walks 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and back home.

The total distance traveled is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we must first calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of buying bananas individually can be calculated as follows:

Number of bananas purchased = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas
Cost per banana = $0.80
Total cost of buying individually = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

On the other hand, the cost of buying bananas in bunches is given as $3.00 per bunch. Therefore, the total cost of buying in bunches is:

Number of bunches purchased = 10
Cost per bunch = $3.00
Total cost of buying in bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

Amount saved = Total cost of buying individually - Total cost of buying in bunches
Amount saved = $32.00 - $30.00
Amount saved = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can approach the problem by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as x. Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 20

This indicates that Sam receives 20 feet of fence. To find the amount left over for Sam, we subtract his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year. 

The total growth in 13 years can be calculated by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years:

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we must first calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its respective price.

Let's begin by calculating the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the total 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, we calculate the number of BMX bikes sold, which accounts for 15% of the total bikes:

Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, we can determine the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:

Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

With the number of each bike type determined, we can now calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, resulting in a total of 5 * 6 = 30 bales after 6 hours. Concurrently, the truck collects 3 bales per hour, yielding a total of 3 * 6 = 18 bales after 6 hours.

The difference between the total bales produced and the total bales collected can be calculated as 30 - 18 = 12. Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the additional minutes he dedicates to learning on weekends.

John attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, his daily class time is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes. Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, his total class time per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

In addition to his class time, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. To find this amount, we calculate 1/16 of 1000 minutes, which equals 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

The total minutes John spends learning per week is the sum of his class time and weekend learning time, which is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. Therefore, 1062.5 minutes is equivalent to 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can model the situation using a geometric sequence. The initial height of the ball is 72 feet, which corresponds to the first term of the sequence. Each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2/3, representing the ball's bouncy behavior.

The height of the ball on its second bounce can be calculated as follows:

a2 = a1 * (2/3)
= 72 * (2/3)
= 48 feet

Therefore, the ball will reach a height of 48 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can utilize a step-by-step approach to calculate their height.

First, we establish the height of the first child, which is 6 feet. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, resulting in a height of 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, yielding a height of 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Lastly, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, leading to a height of 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the orchard, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The total number of apples sold is 2000, and the orchard sells apples in bags of 10. 

First, we calculate the total number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we must consider the sequential consumption events. The Allosaurus consumed 270 kilograms of the remaining meat, which implies that the velociraptors had initially consumed half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) had devoured its share.

Let's denote the amount of meat remaining after the T-Rex's consumption as x kilograms. Consequently, the velociraptors consumed x/2 kilograms. Since the Allosaurus then consumed 270 kilograms, we can establish the equation x/2 = 270.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 yields x = 540. This value represents the amount of meat remaining after the T-Rex's consumption.

To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we must add the T-Rex's share to the remaining amount. The T-Rex consumed 1080 kilograms (twice the amount consumed by the velociraptors). Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 540 + 1080 = 1620 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1620}$"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total surface area of the walls. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 feet by 8 feet, have an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls, each measuring 5 feet by 8 feet, have an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. With two of these walls, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total surface area of the four walls is the sum of the areas of the north and south walls and the east and west walls, which is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons required by dividing the total surface area by 20. This yields 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, to determine the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $12. Therefore, the total cost is 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we must consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, resulting in 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas left. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the ratio of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas, which is 2/11.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/11) * 100 = 18.18%. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.18}$"
"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their distances traveled will be additive.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 and the speed of the second train as v2. We are given that v1 = 60 miles per hour and v2 = v1/2 = 30 miles per hour.

The distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours is given by:
d1 = v1 * t = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Similarly, the distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours is:
d2 = v2 * t = 30 * 3 = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled:
d_total = d1 + d2 = 180 + 90 = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we must first calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. This equates to 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we will round down to 6 days off.

Consequently, Billy is available to volunteer for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Given that he can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, his daily capacity is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Multiplying the number of days he is available by his daily capacity yields a total of 25 * 6 = 150 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of individuals accommodated in the buses and cars separately and then summing these values.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses. With 12 buses and each bus carrying 35 people, the total number of individuals in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars. There are 20 cars, and each car can accommodate 3 people, resulting in a total of 20 * 3 = 60 individuals.

Finally, we sum the number of people in the buses and cars to obtain the total number of individuals inside the church: 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

Given that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can express this relationship as M = K - 4. Since Mike is 24 years old, we can substitute K with 24, yielding M = 24 - 4 = 20.

Furthermore, it is stated that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can express this relationship as J = M + 10. Substituting M with 20, we get J = 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Jeff's age is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can apply the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time taken is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the time taken is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides can be calculated by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

First, we calculate the total minutes spent on lunch and breaks per day. The time for lunch is 30 minutes, and the time for breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time per day is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60. This gives us 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5. Therefore, the total time spent is 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as 'x'. We are given that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber. This can be expressed as:

Amber's distance + Micah's distance + Ahito's distance = Total distance
8 + 3.5(8) + x = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8 + 28 + x = 52
36 + x = 52
x = 52 - 36
x = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after applying the respective discounts.

The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. The discount amount can be calculated as 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the price of the frying pan after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, and it is on sale for 10% off. The discount amount can be calculated as 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Therefore, the price of the set of towels after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be $85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00. Then, adding the cost of the new purchases, the new balance is $70.00 + $58.00 = $128.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, which implies that the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This information allows us to set up the equation x/15 = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the ages of Chris, Ben, and Caroline. 

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given the following information:

1. Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B.

Substituting the value of C into the equation B = 2C, we get B = 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, substituting the value of B into the equation A = 3B, we get A = 3 * 8 = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we must first calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000. She saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. However, she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000, which doesn't make sense in this context. Assuming the question intended to state she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the amount she saves as a percentage of her income.

$20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save the same amount each year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for 20 years, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

However, we need to know how much she needs to save for 20 years. Assuming she wants to save the same amount each year, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save $20,000 per year.

To find the total amount she needs to save, we can multiply the amount she saves per year by the number of years she wants to save for.

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need 20 years to save $400,000.

However, this is the amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save $400,000.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can employ a stepwise approach. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This yields 25 cm per part. 

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This results in 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total number of girls in the school, we can utilize the concept of percentages. Given that 40% of the school population consists of boys, and there are 240 boys, we can establish the following equation:

Let x represent the total number of students in the school. The equation can be set up as follows:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

This calculation yields the total number of students in the school. To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is 360."
"To determine the total amount spent by the individual, we must consider the initial costs of the items purchased and the discount applied at checkout. 

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. The total cost of these items is $19 + $26 = $45. 

Subsequently, a coupon for $7 was applied at checkout, resulting in a reduction of the total cost. Therefore, the final amount spent can be calculated as follows:

$45 - $7 = $38

"To determine the average height of heels at the party, we must first calculate the total height of all the heels. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of women wearing 4-inch heels (3) by the height of their heels (4 inches), and then multiplying the number of women wearing 2-inch heels (3) by the height of their heels (2 inches). The resulting totals are then added together.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

The total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The combined total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of women at the party, which is 6.

18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

Given that she aims to cover a total of 9,300 miles within the month of June, and assuming a 30-day period, we can calculate the required daily mileage as follows:

Total miles / Total days = Required daily miles
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we can subtract the planned daily mileage from the required daily mileage:

Required daily miles - Planned daily miles = Additional miles per day
310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the quantity of each color of ball by its respective price and summing the results.

"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can utilize the concept of percentage increase. The problem states that there was a 20% increase in enrollment. This means that the number of students this year is 120% of the number of students last year.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of students this year = 1.20 x Number of students last year

Given that there were 50 students last year, we can calculate the number of students this year as follows:

Number of students this year = 1.20 x 50
= 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we can first calculate the time interval between each blink. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can find the time interval per blink as follows:

Time interval per blink = Total time / Total blinks
= 5 minutes / 255 blinks
= 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can calculate the total time required for the light to blink 459 times by multiplying the time interval per blink by the total number of blinks:

Total time = Time interval per blink * Total blinks
= 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks
= 9.05 minutes

Therefore, it will take the lighthouse light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To determine the difference in the number of female and male fish, we must first calculate the total number of each type of fish in Tate's garden pond after the purchase.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquired 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The updated counts are as follows:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their respective chores, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the time taken by Amalia to mow the lawn as A, the time taken by Megan to walk the dog as M, and the time taken by Dior to do laundry as D. We are given the following information:

1. A = 4 hours
2. M = A + 2
3. D = A + 4 + 4 (since Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, and Amalia took 4 hours)

We can substitute the value of A into the equations for M and D:

M = 4 + 2 = 6 hours
D = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by adding the individual times:

Total time = A + M + D = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 hours

Therefore, the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 22 hours."
"To determine the total distance driven by John in a month, we must first calculate the round-trip distance. Given that the one-way distance is 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour, the round-trip distance can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 70 mph × 2 hours
= 140 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is the round-trip distance multiplied by 2:

Total Distance = 2 × 140 miles
= 280 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 280 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the given information that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will cover in 7 days by multiplying her daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can find Brian's daily distance by dividing Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers. 

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys. 

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys. 

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys. 

The fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys. 

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the combined weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can start by calculating the weight of each dog.

Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs by adding the weights of their dogs:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To determine the initial number of stickers Seth had, we can analyze the sequence of events. 

First, we know that Kris received 16 stickers, which is the sum of the stickers Kris kept (9) and the stickers Kris gave to Rob (7). This implies that the stickers Kris received from Luis must be 16.

Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, and Kris received 16 stickers, we can deduce that Luis initially had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers.

Finally, as Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers, we can conclude that Seth initially had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we must first calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Given that each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can calculate the total number of M&M's in the large bags as follows:

Total M&M's = Number of bags * Weight per bag * M&M's per ounce
Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can then calculate the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / M&M's per small bag
Number of small bags = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we must first calculate the circumference of the earth and then divide it by the daily distance Alfie flies.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Next, we divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to cover this distance. 

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the speeds of the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We are given that A = 120 mph.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600 mph.

Furthermore, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750 mph.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age at that time, we can establish the following equation:

Liam's current age - 2 = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

Substituting Liam's current age as 16, we get:

16 - 2 = 2x - 4

Simplifying the equation:

14 = 2x - 4

Adding 4 to both sides:

18 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. We can use these equations to solve for the individual values of A, C, and S.

First, we can express C in terms of S using the equation C = S + 12. Substituting this into the equation C + S = 30, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we obtain 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which yields 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find S = 9.

Now that we have the value of S, we can determine the value of C by substituting S = 9 into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can find the value of A by substituting the values of C and S into the equation A + M + C + S = 56. This simplifies to A + A + 21 + 9 = 56. Combining like terms, we get 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we obtain 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we find A = 13.

Finally, to determine the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted, we calculate C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we must first calculate the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons. This can be achieved by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons can be calculated as follows:

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

To convert the weight of the crayons to pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):

Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

As each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is also 8 ounces per box. To convert this to pounds, we divide by 16:

Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = Total weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 8 / 16
= 0.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 0.5 pounds
= 13 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine John's total earnings, we must first calculate the number of logs he can produce from the 80-foot tree. Since he can create logs from 80% of the tree, we can calculate this as follows:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

As each log is 4 feet in length, the number of logs he can produce is:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we need to determine the total number of planks he can create from these logs. Since each log is cut into 5 planks, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate John's total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the selling price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John's total earnings are $96."
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's monthly earnings. Therefore, her brother's monthly earnings can be calculated as 2 times Valerie's monthly earnings, resulting in $10,000.

Next, we need to find the combined monthly earnings of Valerie and her brother, which is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, her monthly earnings can be calculated as 2 times the combined monthly earnings of Valerie and her brother, resulting in $30,000.

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual monthly earnings: $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) + $30,000 (mother) = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a more elegant approach by utilizing the concept of relative motion and the given information about Grandma's walking speeds.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per hour. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per hour.

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We can convert this to hours by dividing by 60:

40 minutes = 40/60 hours = 2/3 hours

The distance covered on the beach is 2 miles, so we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

2/3 = 2 / x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 2 * 3
2x = 6
x = 3

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk:

Speed on sidewalk = 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour

We are given that 1 mile is walked on the sidewalk. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time on sidewalk = 1 / 6 hours
Time on sidewalk = (1/6) * 60 minutes
Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 2/3 + 10
Total time = 2/3 + 10/1
Total time = (2 + 30) / 3
Total time = 32/3
Total time = 10.67 minutes

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To determine the number of additional weeks required for Jane to accumulate a total savings of $60, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount she has already saved by multiplying her weekly savings ($4) by the number of weeks (8):
$4 * 8 = $32

Next, we subtract this amount from the target savings of $60 to determine the remaining amount she needs to accumulate:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find the number of additional weeks required:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to reach her goal of saving $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ a straightforward additive approach. We start by calculating the number of blue birds in the trees with 7 birds each, which yields 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the trees with 4 birds each, resulting in 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. Lastly, we consider the tree with 3 blue birds.

By summing these values, we arrive at a total of 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob possesses, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial number of marbles as x. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. This can be expressed as:

x + 24 = 60

Solving for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Therefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from the initial amount:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear inequalities. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as x degrees.

We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, resulting in a total of 5 ounces of drinkable water. This implies that the average temperature of the water is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the following inequality to represent this condition:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides yields:

x ≥ 47

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cumulative additions of cows and chickens over the specified period.

The farm initially contains 50 cows and 20 chickens. In addition to these, 20 cows and 10 chickens are introduced daily by Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited, respectively. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we can calculate the total number of animals added as follows:

Total cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the initial number of cows and chickens to the cumulative additions:

Total cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each individual bagel after Russell receives a 10% discount on his order, we must first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs in the order. Therefore, the total cost is $10.00 * 4 = $40.00.

The 10% discount on the total cost is calculated as 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

Subtracting the discount from the total cost yields the final amount Russell pays: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

To find the cost of each individual bagel, we divide the final amount by the total number of bagels in the order, which is 9. Thus, the cost per bagel is $36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach to determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate.

Let's denote the number of scoops of mashed potatoes as 's' and the number of potatoes as 'p'. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which can be expressed as s = 23 - 5 = 18.
2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be rewritten as p = (6 - 3) * (3 - 1) = 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we can use the second equation to find the number of potatoes required for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. Since 6 potatoes are required for 2 scoops, we can express this as p = 3s/2. Substituting the value of s from the first equation, we get p = 3 * (18/2) = 27.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs required for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the initial 30 days and the subsequent 30 days.

During the first 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day, resulting in a total of 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the following 30 days, his daily egg consumption increases to 5 eggs, yielding a total of 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The combined total for the 60-day period is the sum of these two quantities: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

To express this in dozens, we divide the total by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs required for 60 days is 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R.

We are provided with the following information:
1. G = 17
2. R = 2G
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60

We can express the total number of jellybeans as the sum of the individual types: B + G + R = 60. Substituting the given values, we get:

B + 17 + 2(17) = 60

Simplifying the equation, we have:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To determine the number of women who have remained on the bus, we can start by establishing the ratio of men to women, which is given as 5:9. This implies that the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

Let's denote the common multiplier as x. We can express the number of men and women in terms of x:

Number of men = 5x
Number of women = 9x

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation:

5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the initial number of women on the bus:

Number of women = 9x
= 9 * 6
= 54

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

Number of women remaining = 54 - 20

"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by calculating the number of bouquets sold. Given that each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day as $56 / $8 = 7.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is 7 * 3 = 21.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold can be found by multiplying the number of bouquets sold by the number of sunflowers per bouquet: 21 * 12 = 252.

Therefore, Faraday sold 252 sunflowers in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{252}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we must first calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases and the total revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

The total cost of the rocks can be found by multiplying the number of rocks purchased (100) by the cost per rock ($5). This yields a total cost of $500.

Next, we calculate the total revenue Adam generates from selling 60% of his inventory. To do this, we first find 60% of the total number of rocks (100), which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks. Then, we multiply the number of rocks sold (60) by the selling price per rock ($7), resulting in a total revenue of $420.

Finally, we calculate the loss by subtracting the total revenue from the total cost: $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

"To determine the current number of roses Patricia possesses, we must consider the sequence of events that have transpired. Initially, she had 30 roses. Subsequently, she gifted 24 roses to her mother, resulting in a reduction of 24 roses. This can be expressed as:

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24

The number of roses remaining can be calculated as:

Remaining roses = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother
= 30 - 24
= 6

Following this, Patricia acquired an additional 15 roses, which can be added to the remaining roses:

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and Y, respectively.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as:

J = C + 5

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can write:

C = 2Y

Substituting the expression for C from the second equation into the first equation, we get:

J = 2Y + 5

Since we know that J = 27, we can substitute this value into the equation:

27 = 2Y + 5

Solving for Y, we get:

2Y = 22
Y = 11

Now that we have found Y, we can find C by substituting Y into the equation C = 2Y:

C = 2(11)
C = 22

Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is C + J + Y = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

Dividing 60 seashells equally among the three people, we get:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Therefore, each person received 20 seashells.

"To determine the total number of carrots Mason consumes in a week, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend days separately and then summing the results.

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, and he consumes 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekend days. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and he consumes 5 carrots each day, resulting in a total of 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Finally, we sum the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and weekend days to obtain the overall weekly consumption. Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total duration of the cassette, we must first calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its duration as follows:

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The second song's length can be expressed as x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x. 

Since the length of the first song is 5 minutes, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:
1.6x = 1.6 * 5 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total duration of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:
Total duration = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total duration = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is 13."
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we must first calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices purchased on Monday is $20 * 2 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices purchased on Tuesday is $20 * 4 = $80.
The total cost is the sum of these two amounts, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is $20 * 2 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is $40 * 6 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit earned by Linus is $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

First, we establish the height of Isabel, which is provided as 7 feet. From this, we can deduce the height of Ned by subtracting 2 feet, yielding 5 feet. Consequently, Carl's height is 1 foot greater than Ned's, resulting in a height of 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as his height, we can calculate the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we must first calculate the total energy demand of the population.

Given that each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, the total energy demand can be calculated as follows:

Total energy demand = 2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the additional number of bottles needed as follows:

Additional bottles needed = Total energy demand - Current production
= 460 bottles - 4200 bottles
= -3740 bottles

However, this calculation yields a negative result, indicating that Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, the number of additional bottles needed is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we must first establish the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Given that Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple and 1/4 in blue, we can calculate the respective numbers as follows:

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers and all the blue wearers also wear bows, we can calculate this as:

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%."
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday as M, T, W, Th, and F, respectively. We are given the following information:

M + T = 1907
Th + F = 2136
M + T + W + Th + F = 5168

We can solve for W by subtracting the sum of the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received in the first two days and the sum of the reports received on Thursday and Friday:

W = (M + T + Th + F) - (M + T)
   = 5168 - 4043
   = 1125

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total area of land sold in the first two transactions. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

The total area sold in the first two transactions is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land remaining.

Abraham then sells the remaining 20 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. Therefore, the total amount earned from the last sale is 20 * 3 = $60.

To find the total amount earned, we add the earnings from the first two sales: $50 + $30 = $80. Adding the earnings from the last sale, we get $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G. The problem states that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. This relationship can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we must first establish the daily usage rate. Given that he changes his face mask 2 times a day and ventures out 3 times a day, the total number of face masks used daily can be calculated as follows:

Daily face mask usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times he goes out per day
Daily face mask usage = 2 * 3
Daily face mask usage = 6

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we then multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = Daily face mask usage * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 6 * 2
Total face masks used every 2 days = 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual. 

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, resulting in 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is the sum of the eggs found by each individual: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we must convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 units each, resulting in a combined total of 400 units. The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two, which is 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 units.

The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is the sum of the units from the first two complexes and the third complex, which is 400 + 640 = 1040 units.

Since John collects garbage three times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

Given that he earns $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings can be calculated as 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10-year life, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to establish the production pattern of the tree. We are given that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We are also informed that the tree does not produce any fruits in the 9th year.

Let's denote the initial number of fruits as x. Based on the given information, we can set up the following equations:

- For a 5-year-old tree: x = 50
- For a 6-year-old tree: 3x = 150
- For a 7-year-old tree: 7x = 350
- For an 8-year-old tree: 7x - 200 = 10x

Solving the first three equations, we find that x = 50. Substituting this value into the fourth equation, we get 7(50) - 200 = 10x, which simplifies to 350 - 200 = 10x, and then 150 = 10x, resulting in x = 15.

Now that we know the initial number of fruits, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is: $\boxed{52700}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has after receiving $20 from Sophia, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100, we can calculate the amount Jack received as a fraction of his initial amount.

Let's denote Jack's initial amount as x. The amount Sophia gave him is 1/5 of her $100, which is (1/5) * 100 = $20. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 20 = 120.

Solving for x, we get x = 120 - 20 = 100.

Therefore, Jack initially had $100, and after receiving $20 from Sophia, he now has a total of $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be expressed as:

B = Y - 7

Additionally, we know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write:

R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which gives us the equation:

Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation, we have:

6Y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides yields:

6Y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6 results in:

Y = 12

Now that we have determined the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'x'. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, we can express the amount of money Rissa was given as 3x.

We know that after giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This implies that the amount she gave to her sister is 1/5 of her total money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x - (1/5)(3x) = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - 3x/5 = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 3x = 12x

This simplifies to:

12x = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

0 = 0

This equation is true for all values of x, but we know that x cannot be 0 since Ronnie was given a non-zero amount of money. Therefore, we need to re-examine our initial assumption.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving an equal amount to her sister, it means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. Since Rissa was given 3x, the amount she gave to her sister is 3x/5.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5 * 3x = 12x/5. The amount she gave to her sister is 3x/5. Therefore, the equation becomes:

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, we can express the total amount of these colors as 3x. The amount of yellow paint is given as half the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is 6 pints.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total amount of paint used:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtracting 6 from both sides yields:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red paint, we can conclude that the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each room and then sum them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

The living room is 5 times larger than a standard bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can calculate the total area of the house by adding the areas of all the rooms together: 240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2440}$"

To find the sum of this sequence, we can apply the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, Alice counted a total of 93 clouds across the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box, we first need to calculate the cost per pod. Given that the regular box of 100 pods costs $12, the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12.

The new box contains 20% more pods than the regular box, so the number of pods in the new box is 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the available budget by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.12 = 8.33 cycles.

Since we cannot run a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of cycles that can be run with the new box for $1 is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40 bills. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he is left with 20 bills. Finally, he triples his money, resulting in 60 bills. 

To convert these bills to 5-dollar bills, we divide the total number of bills by 5. Therefore, Thomas has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the information into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can model the situation using a differential equation. Let's denote the amount of chalk remaining as y (in inches) and the number of days as t.

The rate of change of y with respect to t is given by the rate at which the teacher uses the chalk, which is 20% of the remaining chalk. This can be expressed as:

dy/dt = -0.20y

We are given that the initial amount of chalk is 5 inches, and the teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday. Therefore, the initial condition is y(0) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

To solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:

dy/y = -0.20dt

Integrating both sides, we get:

∫(dy/y) = ∫(-0.20)dt

ln|y| = -0.20t + C

Using the initial condition, we can find the value of C:

ln|2.75| = -0.20(0) + C
ln(2.75) = C

Substituting this value back into the equation, we get:

ln|y| = -0.20t + ln(2.75)

Now, we want to find the number of days t when y = 0. To do this, we can set y = 0 and solve for t:

ln(0) = -0.20t + ln(2.75)

Since ln(0) is undefined, we can rewrite the equation as:

∞ = -0.20t + ln(2.75)

Subtracting ln(2.75) from both sides:

∞ - ln(2.75) = -0.20t

Dividing both sides by -0.20:

t = (∞ - ln(2.75)) / 0.20

Since we cannot directly compute the value of t, we can approximate it using a calculator:

t ≈ (∞ - 1.0498) / 0.20

t ≈ 4.98

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have 5 days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we must first calculate the number of students on varsity. 

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of the total number of girls, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of the total number of boys, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny purchased, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as 'm'. According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. This can be expressed as 3m + 2.

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute m = 5 into the equation to find the number of face masks Johnny bought:

3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we first need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than the number drilled, which implies that 7 additional teeth were capped. Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the number drilled and the number capped.

Total number of teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
= 4 + (7 + 4)
= 4 + 11
= 15

Next, we can calculate the percentage of teeth fixed by dividing the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To determine the amount of refund Mr. Marcellus received, we must first calculate the quantity of milk that was returned. This can be achieved by multiplying the total gallons of milk purchased (4000) by the fraction representing the proportion of expired milk (2/5).

The calculation yields:

(2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

As the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund can be computed as:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the variables for Wendy's and Colin's current ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

The second statement tells us that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can purchase per school, we can first calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000. 

We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can find the number of sets by dividing the total amount by the cost per set:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find the number of sets each school will receive:

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

As each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books each school will receive:

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can purchase 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a recursive approach. Let's define a function f(n) as the number of apples Newton has after the nth iteration.

Initially, Newton has 2 apples. In the first iteration, he picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This results in f(1) = 2 + 5 - 1 = 6 apples.

In the second iteration, he picks up the 6 apples, puts all but 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 back into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This results in f(2) = 6 + 6 - 1 = 11 apples.

We can generalize this pattern to find the number of apples Newton has after n iterations. The number of apples that fall out in each iteration is equal to the number of apples he picked up in the previous iteration. Therefore, the number of apples he has after n iterations is given by the formula:

f(n) = 2 + 5 + 6 + ... + (n+1) - 1

This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 1. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)

where a_1 is the first term and a_n is the nth term.

In this case, a_1 = 2 and a_n = n+1. Therefore, the sum of the first n terms is:

S_n = n/2 * (2 + n+1)
= n/2 * (n+3)

Since Newton picks up all the remaining apples in each iteration, the number of apples he has after n iterations is:

f(n) = S_n - 1
= n/2 * (n+3) - 1

Now, we can find the number of apples Newton brought home by evaluating f(n) at n = 3 (since he made 3 iterations):

f(3) = 3/2 * (3+3) - 1
= 3/2 * 6 - 1
= 9 - 1
= 8

Therefore, Newton brought home 8 apples.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The total weight of coal is 850 kilograms, and it is delivered in 50-kilogram bags, with each bag costing $18. 

First, we calculate the number of bags by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight per bag: 

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to obtain the total cost:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total number of slices consumed by her six friends. Each friend consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, resulting in a total of 10 slices per friend. With six friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can calculate the number of pizzas required for each type as follows:

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

As we cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that Kate has sufficient slices for her friends. Therefore, she needs to purchase 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can employ a straightforward approach by summing the miles he ran on each day. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which equates to 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles. On Tuesday and Thursday, he ran 5 miles each day, resulting in a total of 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles. 

Combining these values, we obtain the total miles run as 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time required for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we must consider the net rate at which he builds snowballs. Jay's hourly snowball production rate is 20, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs lost per hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

The net snowball production rate per hour is therefore 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs at this rate, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net hourly rate:

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine Jim's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jim's age as 'x'. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can express this relationship as an equation: 2x = 28.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = 28 / 2 = 14.

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of apple slices consumed, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate one more slice than Doxa, the number of slices her sister ate is x + 1. Similarly, her brother ate one more slice than her sister, so the number of slices he ate is (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten can be represented as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

3x + 3

Since Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces, we know that x must be less than 8. We can set up an inequality to represent this:

3x + 3 ≤ 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality, we get:

3x ≤ 5

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x ≤ 5/3

Since x must be an integer (as it represents the number of slices), the largest possible value of x is 1. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten is:

1 + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the initial number of bandages, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, totaling 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

We are given that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 15 = 63.

The initial number of bandages is 63.

Final answer: 63"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we must first calculate the reduction in hair length. The initial length of her hair was 10 inches, and it ended at 8 inches, resulting in a reduction of 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut can be calculated as 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

The cost of the color is a fixed amount of $40.

Therefore, the total cost of the cut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we must first calculate her total hours worked. Given that she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate, which is $1.5 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings from hourly rate are:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Additionally, since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an extra $10. Thus, her total earnings for April can be calculated as:

Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To determine Jason's total earnings, we can calculate the amount earned from each activity and then sum them up.

The earnings from emptying the dishwasher can be calculated as 6 instances * $0.50 per instance, resulting in $3.00. 

The earnings from doing laundry are $3.00.

The earnings from taking the trash out can be calculated as 2 instances * $0.75 per instance, resulting in $1.50.

The earnings from cleaning the room are $1.50.

Now, we can sum up the earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

Therefore, Jason's total earnings in a two-week period are $8.00."
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we must first establish the blood volume of a single shark. Given that a shark possesses three times the blood of a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the shark's blood volume by multiplying the whale's volume by 3.

This yields 40 * 3 = 120 gallons per shark.

To find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we then multiply the shark's blood volume by 10, resulting in 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

Therefore, ten sharks in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood."
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct periods: morning, 10:00, and evening.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. At 10:00, an additional 40 people arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 40 = 90 individuals.

Subsequently, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 arrived, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. This brings the total to 90 + 80 = 170 individuals.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the initial number that entered the restaurant had arrived. Since 40 people entered initially, 3 * 40 = 120 people arrived by evening. Therefore, the total number of individuals who entered the restaurant is 170 + 120 = 290.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of red pens by multiplying the number of packs (5) by the number of pens per pack (5), yielding 25 red pens. 

Next, we calculate the number of black pens by multiplying the number of red pens (25) by 2, resulting in 50 black pens.

Finally, we sum the number of red pens (25) and black pens (50) to obtain the total number of pens, which equals 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we must first calculate the cost of the scotch and cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, we can calculate its cost by multiplying the scotch price by 1.5: $60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle.

John purchases twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is then 20 × $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and cognac to find the total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as W1 and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day as P1. We are given that W1 = 20. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day, we can express P1 as 2W1, which equals 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, the number of White Oak trees planted is W2 = W1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is P2 = P1 + (1/4)P1 = 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the number of White Oak trees and Lodgepole Pine trees: Total = W1 + W2 + P1 + P2 = 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the quantity of the beverage.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, resulting in 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining. The subsequent events, however, further reduced the quantity.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, leading to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining. The following day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. Finally, on the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, resulting in 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

To determine the amount each person received, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve the given problem, we can represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be translated into the equation 4x + 8.

Setting up the equation, we have:

4x + 8 = 40

To isolate x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes, which is one-third of the total number of fish. This can be represented as (1/3) * 66. 

Using the formula for fractions, we can simplify this to 66/3, which equals 22.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes. This can be calculated as 66 - 22, which equals 44.

Now, we calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish to determine the number of fish with blue stripes. This can be represented as (5/11) * 44.

Using the formula for fractions, we can simplify this to 5 * 4, which equals 20.

Finally, to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. This can be calculated as 22 + 20, which equals 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we must first calculate the initial number of colors she possessed. 

Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each containing four colors, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had three makeup sets, each with six colors, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. 

Combining these, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

However, her sister stole one palette, which contained four colors, reducing Amy's total to 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Lastly, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had six colors. Half of six is three, so she used up 3 colors, leaving her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we establish the height of the first floor, which is 7 times Mattison's height. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we calculate the height of the second floor, which is three times Mattison's height. Therefore, the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. This yields a height of 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas' contribution are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the number of miles the last dog needs, we must first calculate the total number of miles all four dogs need to walk per day. This can be achieved by summing the individual mileages of the first three dogs, which yields 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average mileage for all four dogs is 3 miles per day, we can calculate the total number of miles all four dogs need to walk per day by multiplying the average by the number of dogs, resulting in 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

To find the mileage required for the last dog, we subtract the total mileage of the first three dogs from the total required mileage for all four dogs, which gives us 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles per day."
"To determine the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

First, we need to calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be found by multiplying the house's value by 0.4. 

House value: $250,000
Loan amount: $250,000 * 0.4 = $100,000

Next, we need to calculate the amount used to pay off debts, which is 60% of the loan amount. This can be found by multiplying the loan amount by 0.6.

Loan amount: $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts: $100,000 * 0.6 = $60,000

Finally, we can find the amount leftover by subtracting the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

Amount leftover: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we must first calculate the total weight of the fish caught. This can be achieved by summing the weights of the individual tunas: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Given that the cost of tuna is $0.50 per kilogram, we can then calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram: 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we can employ the concept of markup. The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. Given that the cost price is $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

The profit is then obtained by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we must first establish the daily water removal rates for each setting. Given that the low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much, which equates to 2 liters per day, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, resulting in 4 liters per day.

We can then calculate the total amount of water removed at each setting by multiplying the daily rate by the respective number of days. For the low setting, this yields 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters. For the medium setting, it is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters. Lastly, for the high setting, it is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To obtain the total amount of water removed, we sum the individual totals: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. The total number of balloons available initially is 10 packs, with each pack containing 30 balloons. This yields a total of 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.

Subsequently, 12 balloons remain unthrown. To calculate the number of balloons thrown, we subtract the number of unthrown balloons from the total: 300 - 12 = 288.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we must first establish the amount of each medicine in a single dose. 

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x mL. According to the problem, the amount of the second medicine is 3 times that of the first, so it can be represented as 3x mL. 

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of these two, which is x + 3x = 4x mL.

We are given that the amount of the first medicine in one dose is 14 mL. Therefore, we can equate 4x to 14 and solve for x:
4x = 14
x = 14/4
x = 3.5

Now that we know the amount of the first medicine in one dose, we can find the amount of the second medicine in one dose, which is 3x = 3(3.5) = 10.5 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
(3.5 + 10.5) * 8 = 14 * 8 = 112 mL.

The final answer is: 112"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to establish the capacity of John's school. Given that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate John's school capacity as follows:

Capacity of John's school = 2 * (1/8 * 120)
= 2 * 15
= 30

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacities of their respective classes:

Combined capacity = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity
= 120 + 30
= 150

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 150."
"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we can break down the problem into two parts: the monthly payments and the remaining balance.

First, we calculate the total amount paid in 11 months. Since Stephen pays $25 per month, the total amount paid in 11 months is:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Next, we calculate the interest on the initial amount borrowed. The interest is 2% of the initial amount, which is $300.

Interest = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Initial amount + Interest
= $300 + $6
= $306

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the sum of the remaining balance and the monthly payment for the twelfth month. Since the monthly payment is $25, the amount to be paid in the twelfth month is:

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Remaining balance + Monthly payment
= $306 + $25
= $331

The final answer is: $331"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that there are 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes daily, the total number of diaper changes necessitates is calculated as follows:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife shares the responsibility of changing diapers, we can infer that Jordan also changes half of the total diaper changes. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of diaper changes by 2:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Therefore, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Next, we need to account for the packing efficiency of the jelly beans, which is given as 80%. This means that only 80% of the total volume of the jar is occupied by the jelly beans. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the volume of the jar by the packing efficiency: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since the jelly beans are estimated to be 30% red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

Therefore, Tim's estimate of the number of red jelly beans was 765 fewer than the true number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This equates to (3/4) * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we must consider the cost of her visits for the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years separately.

The cost of one visit for the first 5 years was $2. Thus, the total expenditure for this period is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, resulting in a new cost of:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

The total expenditure for the subsequent 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

The overall expenditure is the sum of these two periods:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time required for all students to participate in the escape room, we must first calculate the total number of groups that can be formed. With 10 students in each grade and 3 grades in total, the total number of students is 10 * 3 = 30. Since only 8 students can participate in the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Given that we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. The time required for each group is 45 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is also 45 minutes. Thus, the total time required for all students to participate is:

135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of the individual items and then summing them up.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated as 4 × $20 = $80. 

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 × $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of these two costs, which is $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can establish the following equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we obtain:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece, we can calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning required, we must first establish the relationship between the number of meatballs and the amount of meat used. Given that Aiden produces 16 meatballs per pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of meat needed to produce 80 meatballs.

Let's denote the amount of meat needed as x pounds. We can set up the following proportion:

16 meatballs/pound = 80 meatballs
x pounds = 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound
x = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the amount of seasoning required. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, the total amount of seasoning needed is:

2 tablespoons/pound * 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total width of the windows. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window.

Let's denote the number of windows as 'n' and the width of each window as 'w'. The total width of the windows is then given by the product of 'n' and 'w'.

n = 5
w = 35 inches

Total width = n * w
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the required fabric length by multiplying the total width by 2.

Required fabric length = 2 * Total width
Required fabric length = 2 * 175
Required fabric length = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we can employ a piecewise approach, considering the two distinct pricing tiers: $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes and $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes.

For the initial 16 minutes, the cost can be calculated as:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the subsequent 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, resulting in:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Next, we add 1 more inch to this amount, resulting in a total of 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'x' and the number of brownies as 'y'. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as y = 3x - 2.

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets two treats. Since there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats can be represented as 2y = 10.

Substituting y = 3x - 2 into the equation 2y = 10, we get 2(3x - 2) = 10.

Expanding the equation, we have 6x - 4 = 10.

Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6x = 14.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 7/3.

However, since the number of cupcakes must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carly made 2 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the combined price of these services. The basic manicure costs $35, while the basic pedicure costs $40. Therefore, the total cost without any discounts is $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we need to calculate the discount for purchasing both services. The discount is 20% of the total cost, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is then $75 - $15 = $60.

In addition to the discounted price, Karen also wants to add nail art to each of her fingers, which requires 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can break down the information provided and calculate the total number of issues from each magazine.

Let's denote the number of issues the last magazine sends as 4x, where x is the number of issues the 6-issue magazine sends. We know that the 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues per year, so we can set up the equation 4x = 6 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 6/4 = 1.5.

Now, we can calculate the number of issues each magazine sends per year: 
- The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.
- The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 6 issues per year.
- The last magazine sends 4x = 4(1.5) = 6 issues per year.

Adding the total number of issues from all the magazines, we get 36 + 6 + 6 = 48.

Therefore, Susan receives 48 magazines per year.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the number of paintings Kim has, we can establish a relationship between the number of paintings each individual has. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's total can be expressed as x + 8.

Samantha, on the other hand, has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, Samantha's total can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. Setting up an equation to represent this relationship, we have:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To determine the final price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December. The toy's initial price is $40, and it increases by 80%. This can be represented as $40 + 0.8 * $40. 

$40 + 0.8 * $40 = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. The price in December is $72, and it decreases by 50%. This can be represented as $72 - 0.5 * $72.

$72 - 0.5 * $72 = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To determine Charlie's total earnings for the day, we must first calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

The standard rate is $80 per hour, and Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at this rate. Therefore, the total amount he earns from the standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the lessons with veterans, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This reduction equates to a 25% decrease in the original rate of $80. To calculate the reduced rate, we can find 25% of $80, which is 0.25 * $80 = $20. Subtracting this amount from the original rate yields a reduced rate of $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. Charlie has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

The total amount Charlie will make for the day is the sum of the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To calculate the mean score, we must first determine the sum of all the scores. This can be achieved by adding each score individually.

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Summing these values, we obtain:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

To calculate the mean, we divide the total score by the number of scores, which is 9. 

Mean = Total score ÷ Number of scores
Mean = 630 ÷ 9
Mean = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 20 - 5
x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we first need to calculate the number of apples he had after eating 2/5 of them.

Let's denote the total number of apples as 'x'. Since Walter ate 2/5 of the apples, the number of apples he ate is (2/5)x. The remaining number of apples can be calculated as:

x - (2/5)x = (3/5)x

We know that Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. 25% can be represented as 1/4. So, the number of apples he gave to his sister is (1/4) * (3/5)x = (3/20)x.

The remaining number of apples after giving some to his sister is:
(3/5)x - (3/20)x = (12/20)x - (3/20)x = (9/20)x

Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of remaining apples by the selling price:

(9/20)x * 3 = (27/20)x

Since Walter bought 60 apples initially, we can substitute x = 60 into the equation:

(27/20) * 60 = 0.27 * 60 = 16.2

The final answer is: $16.20"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. If 9 novels represent three-quarters of the total novels written this year, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total.

Let x be the total number of novels written this year. The proportion can be expressed as:

3/4 = 9/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 9 * 4
3x = 36

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 36 / 3
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we can employ the formula for calculating the distance traveled, which is the product of the average speed and the time elapsed. Given that Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr and the time elapsed is 3 days, we first need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equivalent to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the total number of grapes used by the family. Madeline's consumption is given as 6 grapes. Her brother utilized 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which equates to 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The combined total of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Next, we consider the mother's usage of grapes. The recipe for the pies calls for 12 grapes per pie, and she made 4 pies. Therefore, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by the family is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother (36) and the grapes used by the mother (48), which equals 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we add the total number of grapes used by the family (84) to the number of grapes used by the mother (48), which equals 84 + 48 = 132 grapes.

Therefore, there were 132 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day, we can employ a simple addition operation. 

The number of teachers who were sick is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. By adding these two quantities together, we can obtain the total number of teachers present at the school.

13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on making macaroni and cheese, we must first calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients. The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and the total cost of cheddar and gruyere cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00. Therefore, the total weekly cost is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud prepares macaroni and cheese once a week, the total annual expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the weekly cost by 52 weeks. Thus, the total annual expenditure is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the task. With 80 classrooms and 15 minutes per classroom, the total time spent cleaning can be found by multiplying the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Converting the total time to hours yields:

1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Given that the custodian works 8 hours per day, we can calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiplying by 100:

(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases required to hold Elly's books, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. Given that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, we can denote the capacity of the bottom shelf as 2 * 10 = 20 books and the top shelf as 20 - 5 = 15 books.

The total capacity of the bookcases can be calculated by summing the capacities of the shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find the number of bookcases needed, we divide the total number of books (110) by the total capacity of the bookcases (55). This yields 110 / 55 = 2.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bookcase, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly requires 3 bookcases to accommodate all her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we must first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of dozens of eggs purchased (5) by the cost per dozen ($2.40). This yields a total cost of 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Next, we must calculate the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, we can calculate the total selling price by multiplying the number of eggs (60) by the selling price per egg ($1). This results in a total selling price of 60 * $1 = $60.

Finally, we can determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price: $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total, or 1/2 * 100 = 50 hats.

Next, we subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Then, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we must first calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Next, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag, which is 30. This yields a cost per stick of $15.00 / 30 = $0.50.

To express this cost in cents, we multiply by 100, resulting in 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test, we must first calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she must answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as follows:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Now, we can calculate 70% of the total questions:

70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Since Audrey has already answered 60% of the questions correctly on the first test, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test as follows:

Questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions already answered correctly on the first test
= 77 - 42
= 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we can establish a relationship between the number of strawberry cubes and the total number of ice cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. The number of blueberry cubes is then 5x - 4, as it is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.

Given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6 results in:

x = 20

Now that we have determined the number of strawberry cubes, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"

Performing the multiplication, we obtain: Total points = 3360.

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can analyze the sequence of events. Initially, he had 10 marbles. Upon tripping and dropping half of them, he lost 5 marbles. This resulted in a total of 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Subsequently, he found 3 additional marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, upon inspecting the marbles further, he discovered that one of them was not a marble but a bead. Therefore, he discarded it, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's define the variables:

- Let x be the number of telephone calls made.
- Let y be the number of potential customers generated.
- Let z be the number of customers who visit the dealership.

We are given the following relationships:

1. For every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated: y = x/25
2. For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold: z = y/2

We want to find the value of x when z = 15 (i.e., Jason needs to sell 15 cars). Substituting z = 15 into the second equation, we get:

15 = y/2
y = 30

Now, substituting y = 30 into the first equation, we get:

30 = x/25
x = 30 * 25
x = 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we must first calculate the number of each type of light source.

Given that there are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people, including Brianna, we can deduce that each person will carry a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 people * 2 flashlights/person = 8 flashlights.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. Since half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each, we can calculate the total number of candles as follows:

- Number of small candles: 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles
- Number of medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

Now, we can find the total number of candles by adding the number of small and medium candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family is 8 flashlights + 36 candles = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips available. Since Mitchell purchases two bags, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find the number of chips each person receives. This can be calculated as 110 ÷ 5 = 22.

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and calculate the time for each segment.

The time for the first side is given as 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, resulting in 10 minutes each. The last two sides, the fourth and fifth sides, take half as long as the first side, which is 2.5 minutes each.

To find the total time, we sum the time for each segment: 5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room, we can employ a systematic approach to solve the problem. 

First, we establish the relationship between the number of helmets and footballs. Given that there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can express this relationship as:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2

Substituting the given value for the number of helmets (20), we can solve for the number of footballs:

20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Next, we determine the number of robots, which is half the number of helmets:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Finally, we calculate the total number of items by summing the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of calls he handles in an hour. Given that it takes him 15 minutes to address a call, we can calculate this by dividing the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time required to handle a single call (15 minutes).

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Next, we can calculate the total number of calls he handles in a day by multiplying the number of calls he handles per hour by the number of hours he works in a day (6 hours).

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Finally, to find the total number of calls he handles in a week, we multiply the number of calls he handles per day by the number of days he works in a week (5 days).

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the additional time required for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we can calculate the difference in drying times per painting and then multiply it by the number of paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes. The difference in drying time per painting is 12 - 7 = 5 minutes.

For 6 paintings, the additional time required for the new varnish to dry is 5 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can employ a systematic approach. First, we need to identify the number of plants in each category and their corresponding water requirements.

Let's denote the total number of plants as N. We know that 4 plants require half a cup of water, 8 plants require 1 cup of water, and the remaining plants require a quarter of a cup of water. 

We can express the number of remaining plants as N - 4 - 8 = N - 12. Since these plants require a quarter of a cup of water, their total water requirement can be represented as (N - 12) * 0.25.

The total water required for all plants can be calculated by adding the water requirements for each category: 4 * 0.5 + 8 * 1 + (N - 12) * 0.25.

Simplifying the expression, we get: 2 + 8 + 0.25N - 3 = 0.25N + 7.

Therefore, the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants is 0.25N + 7 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.25N + 7}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the time spent traversing both the terrestrial and aquatic segments of his journey.

Given that half of the distance is covered on land and the other half in water, we can calculate the time required for each segment separately. 

The total distance is 200 yards, so the land distance is 100 yards and the water distance is also 100 yards.

The time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of these two times: 5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.

Therefore, Phineas will take 15 minutes to return home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks required for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed (56) by the number of sticks per box (8) to determine the number of boxes required. This calculation yields:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, we can then multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box to obtain the total cost:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the costs associated with the plan. The main phone is priced at $20, and each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone. Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

With four additional phones, the total cost of these phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones yields the overall cost of the plan: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine Derrick's total earnings in June, we must first calculate the daily production of doughnuts and then multiply it by the number of days in the month. 

Derrick's bakery produces 10 dozen doughnuts per day, with each dozen consisting of 12 doughnuts. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts produced daily is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since June has 30 days, the total number of doughnuts produced in June is 120 * 30 = 3600.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick's total earnings in June can be calculated as 3600 * 2 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning services in 5 weeks.

The final answer is: $47.00"
"To determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we must first calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute. Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, his new speed can be calculated as 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, where each page contains 450 words. This can be calculated as 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Finally, to determine the time required to speak 4500 words at a rate of 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we calculate the number of people on the first three days. On the first day, there were 50 people. The next day, 20 more people were present, resulting in 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, we add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into distinct intervals and analyze the rate of popping in each interval.

Initially, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds. This establishes a baseline rate of 20 kernels per 30 seconds.

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate increases by a factor of three, resulting in 60 kernels popped. This indicates a tripling of the initial rate, yielding a new rate of 60 kernels per 30 seconds.

The popping rate then increases by a factor of four, resulting in 80 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds. This signifies a quadrupling of the previous rate, leading to a new rate of 80 kernels per 30 seconds.

Finally, the popping rate decreases by half, resulting in 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds. This signifies a halving of the previous rate, yielding a new rate of 40 kernels per 30 seconds.

To calculate the total number of kernels popped, we sum the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the kernels that popped in that interval also pop from residual heat. This equates to 10 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 200 (from the main cooking process) + 10 (from residual heat) = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first establish the lemon-to-juice ratio. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can express this relationship as a proportion: 6 lemons / 1 cup = 1.

To calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 gallons of lemonade, we must first convert the volume from gallons to cups, as the lemon juice ratio is given in cups. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so 5 gallons is equivalent to 5 * 16 = 80 cups.

Now, we can calculate the number of lemons required for 80 cups of juice:
(6 lemons / 1 cup) * 80 cups = 480 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an additional gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for this extra gallon. As the tartness is directly proportional to the juice content, the extra gallon will require half the amount of juice:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
(6 lemons / 1 cup) * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
480 lemons + 12 lemons = 492 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{492}$"
"To determine the total weekly dog food requirement, we must first calculate the daily consumption of each breed and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of German Shepherds can be calculated as 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 

The total daily consumption is the sum of these two values, which is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, resulting in 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will require 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of legs and then dividing by 2.

First, we calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of 2-legged animals by 2 and the number of 4-legged animals by 4. This is based on the fact that each 2-legged animal contributes 2 legs and each 4-legged animal contributes 4 legs.

Total legs = (2-legged animals * 2) + (4-legged animals * 4)
Total legs = (10 * 2) + (15 * 4)
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

Now, to find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.

Total pairs of legs = Total legs / 2
Total pairs of legs = 80 / 2
Total pairs of legs = 40

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize the principle of conservation of mass. Given that the total number of blocks is 32, and the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, we can establish the following equation:

Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. The total number of blocks can be expressed as:

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 + r = 32

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20."
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Initially, Elvis travels west for 5 hours at a constant speed of 18mph. The distance covered during this period can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 5 hours
= 90 miles

Next, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance covered during this period is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 8 hours
= 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can find the net distance from his house by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we can calculate the depreciation for each year using the formula for depreciation: 

Value after depreciation = Initial value * (1 - depreciation rate)

Year 1:
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation rate = 30% = 0.3
Value after Year 1 = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation rate = 30% = 0.3
Value after Year 2 = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation rate = 20% = 0.2
Value after Year 3 = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we must first establish the quantities of the other colors. We are given that the bag contains 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Let's denote the number of orange candies as 2x and the number of yellow candies as x/2. We are also given that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

54 (red) + 2x (orange) + x/2 (yellow) = 232

To solve for x, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

108 + 4x + x = 464

Combine like terms:

108 + 5x = 464

Subtract 108 from both sides:

5x = 356

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 71.2

Since x represents the number of yellow candies, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

232 - 54 (red) - 2x (orange) - x/2 (yellow) = 232 - 54 - 2(71.2) - 71.2/2
= 232 - 54 - 142.4 - 35.6
= 232 - 227.6
= 4.4

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a candy, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 4 pink candies in the bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we must first calculate the cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.

The cost of one bus trip can be calculated as 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two costs: $80 + $56 = $136.

The final answer is: $136"
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as 'x'. Since Mazie initially had 52 marbles and gave them to the twins, we can express the total number of marbles given as the sum of the marbles given to Dallas and Darla: x + 25 = 52.

We know that Dallas initially had 25 marbles, which is obtained by subtracting the 4 marbles dropped from the total he received. 

Solving for 'x', we get: x = 52 - 25
x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total cost of the outing, we must consider the expenses incurred by the family. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, while a child's ticket costs $8. The family consists of 3 individuals, so the total cost of the tickets is calculated as follows:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

In addition to the tickets, the family purchases 2 popcorns at $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

The total cost of the outing is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:

"To determine the average age of Mia and Emma, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that Mia is 16 years younger than Emma and Mia's age is 40, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

With both ages determined, we can now calculate the average age by taking the sum of their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the sum of the seashells found by each individual. This can be achieved through the addition of Tom's, Nancy's, and Benny's seashells.

Let's denote the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny as T, N, and B, respectively. We are given the following information:

T = 214
N = 432
B = 86

The total number of seashells found is the sum of the individual counts, which can be expressed as:

Total seashells = T + N + B
= 214 + 432 + 86
= 732

However, we are also informed that 67 seashells were cracked. To find the number of good seashells, we must subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total count:

Number of good seashells = Total seashells - Number of cracked seashells
= 732 - 67
= 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells found is 665."
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of each type of plate and then summing the results.

The cost of the dinner plates can be calculated as 12 * $6.00 = $72.00. This represents the total expenditure on dinner plates for 12 individuals.

Similarly, the cost of the bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00, which accounts for the expenditure on bowls for the same number of guests.

Lastly, the cost of the salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00, representing the total cost of salad plates for the 12 guests.

To obtain the overall cost of the place settings, we can sum these individual costs: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final answer is: $180.00"

Next, we must calculate the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle. According to the problem, Anna's time is 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. To find this, we divide Steve's time by 2 and then add 2 hours.

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption of Dexter's pigs. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig consumes per day.

Let's denote the number of pigs as 'n' and the amount of feed each pig eats per day as 'f'. The total daily feed consumption can be expressed as:

Total daily feed consumption = n * f

Given that there are 5 pigs and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we can rewrite the equation as:

Total daily feed consumption = 5 * 4 * 2
Total daily feed consumption = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total weekly feed consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly feed consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days
Total weekly feed consumption = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total weekly feed consumption from the total amount ordered:

Feed left = 300 pounds - 280 pounds
Feed left = 20 pounds

"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each guest will consume 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed can be calculated as follows:

Total hot dogs required = Number of guests * Number of hot dogs per guest
Total hot dogs required = 20 * 2
Total hot dogs required = 40

However, John already possesses 4 hot dogs, so we must subtract these from the total to avoid overestimation:

Total hot dogs available = 40 - 4
Total hot dogs available = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 units, we can determine the number of packs required by dividing the total hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs required = Total hot dogs available / Number of hot dogs per pack
Number of packs required = 36 / 6
Number of packs required = 6

Finally, to calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of packs required by the cost per pack:

Total cost = Number of packs required * Cost per pack
Total cost = 6 * 2
Total cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must first calculate her total revenue and total expenditures.

Her revenue from cupcakes can be calculated as 20 cupcakes multiplied by the price of each cupcake, which is $2. This yields a revenue of $40. Similarly, her revenue from cookies is 40 cookies multiplied by the price of each cookie, which is $1, resulting in an additional $40. Therefore, her total revenue is $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we calculate her total expenditures. Frances purchases five trays at $4 each, so her total expenditure on trays is 5 * $4 = $20.

To find her remaining funds, we subtract her total expenditures from her total revenue: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of children following the ice cream truck, we can model the situation using a sequence. 

Initially, there are 5 children. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children. 

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, leading to a total of 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30 children. 

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, leaving 30 - 5 = 25 children.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the ice cream truck.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of meals distributed over the three days: 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals. 

Next, we subtract this total from the initial number of meals: 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals.

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The final answer is: 1218"
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we can calculate the value of each coin and sum them together. 

The value of a quarter is 25 cents, two nickels amount to 10 cents, and seven dimes amount to 70 cents. 

Combining these values, we get 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

Therefore, James has a total of 105 cents.

The final answer is 105."
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we first need to establish the age of the older brother. Given that one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can deduce the older brother's age by doubling the age of the younger brother.

12 * 2 = 24

With the ages of the brothers established as 12 and 24, and knowing that the sisters are all 16 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings by summing their individual ages.

Total age = (12 + 24) + (3 * 16)
Total age = 36 + 48
Total age = 84

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice over a period of four weeks, we must first calculate the daily and weekly time spent on each activity.

Charisma's daily meditation practice consists of two 15-minute sessions, resulting in a total of 30 minutes per day. Multiplying this by the number of days in a week (7) yields a weekly meditation time of 30 minutes * 7 = 210 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours per week.

Her yoga practice consists of 1 hour per day, 5 days a week, resulting in a weekly practice time of 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week.

To find the total time spent on both activities over four weeks, we add the weekly meditation and yoga times: 3.5 hours/week + 5 hours/week = 8.5 hours/week. Multiplying this by the number of weeks (4) yields a total time of 8.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 34 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric required for the quilt, we can calculate the area of each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

The area of a small t-shirt is 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt is 6 square feet. Given that Octavia is using 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts, we can calculate the total area as follows:

Area of small shirts = 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
Area of medium shirts = 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
Area of large shirts = 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we can find the total area by summing up the areas of each type of shirt:
Total area = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

Therefore, the quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{101}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we must first establish the number of seeds in each type of sunflower. A small sunflower contains 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Given that a large sunflower possesses 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, we can calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower by finding 50% of 36 and adding it to 36. Fifty percent of 36 is 0.5 * 36 = 18. Therefore, a large sunflower contains 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds can be obtained by summing the seeds from both sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George. It is stated that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Given that George possesses 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pen count by multiplying 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can then calculate her pen count by dividing Timothy's total by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert.

Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x. We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is x + 3.

We are also given that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. Since Albert is 36 inches tall, we can express Anne's height as 2 * 36 = 72 inches. Consequently, we can express Jackie's current height as 72 - 2 = 70 inches.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Jackie's height before the summer (x) and her current height (x + 3): x + 3 = 70.

Solving for x, we get x = 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

The final answer is: 67"
"To determine the total revenue generated by the company from selling chocolate bars over a two-week period, we must first calculate the total number of bars produced during this time frame. 

Given that the company produces 5000 bars in a single day, the total number of bars produced in 14 days can be calculated as follows:

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

Since each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue can be found by multiplying the total number of bars produced by the price per bar:

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we can break down the costs of the T-shirts and shoes separately.

First, we calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. However, the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. Therefore, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4.

The total cost of the T-shirts is the sum of the cost of the first T-shirt and the discounted cost of the second T-shirt: $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine Ryan's current financial situation, we must first calculate his total earnings from completing his chores. Given that he receives $6 per week for 3 weeks, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $6 * 3
Total earnings = $18

Next, we need to account for the expenses incurred from purchasing ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. The cost of the ice cream cones can be calculated as:

Cost of ice cream cones = Number of cones * Price per cone
Cost of ice cream cones = 4 * $1.25
Cost of ice cream cones = $5

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings yields Ryan's remaining funds:

Remaining funds = Total earnings - Cost of ice cream cones
Remaining funds = $18 - $5
Remaining funds = $13

Now, we must determine how many movie tickets Ryan can purchase with his remaining funds. Given that each ticket costs $6.50, we can calculate the number of tickets he can buy as follows:

Number of tickets = Remaining funds / Price per ticket
Number of tickets = $13 / $6.50
Number of tickets = 2

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and her sister, Lani, we can calculate the individual expenditures and then sum them up.

Ellen's expenditures consist of a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Therefore, her total expenditure is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani's expenditures include a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total cost of the bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, her total expenditure is $30 + $200 = $230.

The combined total expenditure for both Ellen and Lani is $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To determine the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing one jar of the mixture. This involves summing the costs of the individual ingredients: passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of 2 pounds of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.
Therefore, the total cost of one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Given that Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To calculate the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we can calculate the value of each type of coin and sum them together. 

First, we'll calculate the value of the quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8. 

Next, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50. 

Then, we'll calculate the value of the nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6. 

Lastly, we'll calculate the value of the pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50. 

Now, we'll add the values together: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To determine Janet's remaining balance, we must first calculate the total amount she expended. This can be achieved by summing the individual expenditures: $3.50 (ice cream) + $7.50 (movie tickets for herself) + $7.50 (movie tickets for her sister) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $28.

Given that Janet's parents provided her with $40, we can then calculate her remaining balance by subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount received: $40 - $28 = $12.

Therefore, Janet has $12 left.

The final answer is: $12"

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He then consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, reducing his inventory to 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

Subsequently, he consumes 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, resulting in 4 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

Following this, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 4 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

Lastly, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, increasing his inventory to 4 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

Therefore, Randy now has a total of 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 cookies.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we can calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves. Each half consists of 6 toy soldiers. 

The first half, consisting of 6 toy soldiers priced at $5 each, yields a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

The second half, also consisting of 6 toy soldiers priced at $7 each, yields a total of 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn from selling his entire collection is the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine the number of weeks required to fill in all the holes, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, resulting in a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Upon Nate's return, he fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night. This results in a net change of 3 holes per day (9 filled - 6 dug). To find the number of days required to fill the 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net change per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the total number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that it enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this as a fraction and then calculate the result.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. The total number of cookies is 7995, and we are given the quantities of rainbow cookies (2595) and oatmeal cookies (3075). 

Let's denote the number of chocolate chip cookies as x. The sum of all types of cookies is equal to the total number of cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2595 + 3075 = 7995

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 5670 = 7995

Subtracting 5670 from both sides yields:

x = 7995 - 5670
x = 2325

Thus, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as t, b, and p, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so t = 16 / 2 = 8.
2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so p = 14 + 2 = 16.
3. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so t + b + p = 29.

We can substitute the values of t and p into the third equation to solve for b:

8 + b + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

b = 29 - 8 - 16
b = 5

However, we know that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Therefore, the number of beakers he lost is:

x = 7 - b
x = 7 - 5
x = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg requires 2 screws, the total number of screws needed for 4 tables can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables × Number of legs per table × Number of screws per leg
= 4 × 4 × 2
= 32

Given that James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
= 40 - 32
= 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Then, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x.

The total number of eggs in both baskets can be calculated by adding the number of eggs in each basket: x + 2x = 3x.

Given that we know the number of eggs in the first basket is 10, we can substitute this value into the equation: 3x = 10.

Solving for x, we find that x = 10/3. However, since the number of eggs must be a whole number, we can round this value to the nearest whole number. In this case, x = 3.33, which is not a whole number. 

However, since we are dealing with a discrete quantity (eggs), we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of an egg. Therefore, the number of eggs in the first basket is 3.

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets: 3 + 2(3) = 3 + 6 = 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the total amount of money raised, we can utilize a straightforward approach by calculating the individual contributions and then summing them.

Let's denote Alexandra's contribution as A, Kim's contribution as K, Maryam's contribution as M, and Sarah's contribution as S. We are given the following information:

1. K = A + $320
2. M = S + $400
3. S = $300

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for M, yielding:
M = $300 + $400 = $700

Next, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for K, yielding:
K = A + $320

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for K, yielding:
K = A + $320 = $700 + $320 = $1020

We are also given that A = $430. Therefore, we can calculate K as:
K = $430 + $320 = $750

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by summing the individual contributions:
Total = A + K + M + S
= $430 + $750 + $700 + $300
= $2080

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'a' miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as 'v' miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as:

a = 2v

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice the distance Aaron ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as 'd'. Then, we can express this as:

d = 4 / 2
d = 2 miles

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find his speed 'a' by dividing the time by the distance:

a = 16 / 2
a = 8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed 'v' by substituting 'a' into the equation a = 2v:

8 = 2v
v = 8 / 2
v = 4 miles per minute

Finally, we can find Vanessa's time by multiplying her distance (4 miles) by her speed (4 miles per minute):

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * 4
Time = 16 minutes

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the total length of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and the existing dock measures 200 feet, the total line required can be calculated as 3 times the length of the dock, which yields 3 * 200 = 600 feet.

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to acquire, we must subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required. This results in 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we must first calculate the daily revenue. Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, with each reservation consisting of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation) * $5 per meal + $5 per bottle of wine
= 12 meals * $5 per meal + $5 per bottle
= $60 + $5
= $65 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue can be calculated by multiplying the daily revenue by 2:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $65 per day * 2
= $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can employ the concept of percentage increase. Given that the vendor sold all 50 watermelons at a profit of 25%, we can calculate the selling price per unit as follows:

Let's denote the cost price per watermelon as C. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can express this as:

50C = 80

To find the cost price per watermelon, we can divide both sides by 50:

C = 80 / 50
C = $1.60

Now, we can calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. The profit amount is 25% of the cost price, which can be expressed as 0.25C. Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
= C + 0.25C
= 1.25C
= 1.25 * $1.60
= $2.00

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which implies her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. Since James is twice as old as Dora, we can calculate James' current age as 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Given that James is 18 years old, and he was born when John was 19, we can find John's current age by adding the age difference between James' birth and John's age at James' birth. This results in John's current age being 19 + 18 = 37 years.

Now, we can find the age of John's youngest son by subtracting the age difference between John's birth and the son's birth from John's current age. This yields 37 - 32 = 5 years.

Therefore, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a series of equations. Let's assume that Ana peels x oranges in the first minute, and Jane peels x oranges in the first minute as well. 

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in the first minute is 0.

In the second minute, Ana peels x - 1 oranges, and Jane peels x oranges. The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in the second minute is x - (x - 1) = 1.

In the third minute, Ana peels x - 2 oranges, and Jane peels x oranges. The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in the third minute is x - (x - 2) = 2.

We can see that the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in each minute is increasing by 1. 

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes) will be the sum of the first 59 positive integers.

The sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:

Sum = n(n + 1)/2

In this case, n = 59. 

Sum = 59(59 + 1)/2
Sum = 59 * 60/2
Sum = 1770

Since the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in the first minute is 0, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour is 1770.

Final Answer: The final answer is 1770."
"To determine the total cost incurred by Mark, we need to calculate the discounted price of the radiator and then add the labor cost.

The original price of the radiator is $400. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost incurred by Mark is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To determine the number of chickens on the farm, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we have the equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:

2x + 2y = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate x:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
2y = 30
y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into the first equation to find x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we must first calculate the total number of slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is the product of the number of pizzas and the number of slices per pizza, which is 7 * 8 = 56.

With 4 individuals sharing the pizzas equally, we can find the number of slices each person can have by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people. This results in 56 ÷ 4 = 14 slices per person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is 14."
