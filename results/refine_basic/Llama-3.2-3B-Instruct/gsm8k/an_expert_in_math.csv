"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.

She then bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her remaining eggs to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

The total amount she makes is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased the value by 150%. 

We can find the new value by multiplying the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

The number of sprints per week is 3, and the number of meters per sprint is 60. 

Total meters per week = 3 * 60 = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed required for her flock. Since each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed, we can find the amount needed for the final meal by subtracting the amount already given from the total daily feed.

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already given
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5. 

For the remaining 15 glasses, we need to calculate 60% of the cost of the first glass. Since 60% is equivalent to 0.6, we can multiply the cost of the first glass by 0.6 to find the cost of each subsequent glass.

Cost of each subsequent glass = $5 * 0.6 = $3

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the remaining 15 glasses by multiplying the cost of each subsequent glass by 15.

Total cost of remaining glasses = $3 * 15 = $45

The total cost of all 16 glasses is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the total cost of the remaining glasses.

Total cost = $5 + $45 = $50

The final answer is $50."
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the cities.

Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T. We are given that S = 20.

We also know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so C = 4S. Substituting S = 20, we get C = 4 * 20 = 80.

Furthermore, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so T = 2C. Substituting C = 80, we get T = 2 * 80 = 160.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in each city: T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we can break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

The first download consists of Carla downloading 80% of the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. To find the time taken for the first download, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Rate

Time = 0.8 * 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 160 minutes

The second download is a full 200 GB file at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. To find the time taken for the second download, we can use the same formula:

Time = Total Amount / Rate
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

Since the download is interrupted and restarted, we need to add the time taken for the first download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second download. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

Total Time = 160 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes
Total Time = 180 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Next, we consider the 2 hours he spent in standstill traffic, during which he didn't move. This doesn't contribute to the total distance.

Then, we calculate the distance he traveled during the next 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance he traveled during the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, we sum up the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:

Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John started 180 miles away from home and traveled a total of 355 miles, we can find the distance he is from home by subtracting the total distance traveled from the initial distance:

Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance = 180 - 355

However, this would result in a negative value, indicating that John is actually behind his starting point. To find the correct distance, we need to consider the direction of travel. Since John initially drove away from home, we should subtract the total distance from the initial distance, but we must also account for the direction of travel. A more accurate approach is to find the distance traveled in the opposite direction and subtract it from the initial distance.

The distance traveled in the opposite direction is the same as the total distance, 355 miles. Therefore, the correct calculation is:

Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance = 180 - 355 = -175 miles

Since distance cannot be negative, we can take the absolute value of the result:

Distance from home = | -175 | = 175 miles

Therefore, John is 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into two components: regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the regular hours worked, which is 40 hours at $10 per hour:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 45 hours in total, the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down as follows:

Let's start with the first month, which had 60 downloads. The second month had three times as many downloads as the first month, so it had 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen and then add the results together.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 * $68 = $204
Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 * $80 = $160
Then, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 * $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the annual net profit is $7.50. We can set up the equation:

90 = 7.50y

To solve for 'y', we can divide both sides by 7.50:

y = 90 / 7.50
y = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the lemon tree to break even.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

The remaining vacuum cleaners are then sold at the orange house, and it's given that she sold half of what was left. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house as y/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the equation can be set up as:

x - (x/3 + 2) - y/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6. Multiplying the entire equation by 6 to eliminate the fractions, we get:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3y = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 3y = 42

Now, we need to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners, x. We can express y in terms of x from the original statement: y = 2 * (x/3 + 2). Simplifying this, we get:

y = 2x/3 + 4

Substituting this expression for y into the previous equation:

4x - 3(2x/3 + 4) = 42

Expanding and simplifying:

4x - 2x - 12 = 42

Combine like terms:

2x - 12 = 42

Add 12 to both sides:

2x = 54

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students: 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Finally, we determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting those enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

Let's calculate the potential value of each item after the market increase.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets.

The final answer is: $160"
"When two trains depart from San Rafael at the same time and travel westward for 80 miles, they are essentially covering the same distance. The next day, they travel northward, covering a combined total of 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can consider the northward distance as the sum of the distances covered by both trains. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can divide the total northward distance by 2 to find the distance covered by each train.

Total distance covered by each train = (80 miles + 150 miles) / 2
= 230 miles / 2
= 115 miles

Therefore, each train covers 115 miles in the two days.

The final answer is 115."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from both teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. She works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour. 

Weekly earnings from teaching: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
Annual earnings from teaching: $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour.

Weekly earnings from coaching: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
Annual earnings from coaching: $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, we can find her total annual salary by adding her earnings from teaching and coaching.

Total annual salary: $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that period. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we can find the total number of eggs she eats in a week by multiplying the number of eggs she makes per day (3) by the number of days in a week (7). This gives us 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per week (21) by 4. This results in 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Now, to convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs (84) by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. This gives us 84 / 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the concept of average speed. Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. We can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain the desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain the desired average speed for the remaining distance."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, so the amount of the pineapple drink is 24 - 9 = 15 liters.

Now, we can calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and the amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of orange drink is 9 liters. 
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the difference between his current age and the age at which he had his son.

First, we find Raymond's current age by subtracting the age difference between him and Samantha from Samantha's age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25.

Next, we subtract the age at which Raymond had his son (23) from his current age (25) to find the number of years that have passed since his son's birth.

25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold, we can break down the sales into distinct groups and calculate the total for each group.

First, we consider the first 3 customers who purchased one DVD each. This gives us a total of 3 DVDs.

Next, we examine the next 2 customers, who each bought 2 DVDs. Multiplying the number of customers by the number of DVDs each bought, we get 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Lastly, we look at the last 3 customers, who did not make any purchases. This results in 0 DVDs.

Now, we add the total number of DVDs sold from each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total length of the candle that melts, we need to calculate the difference in hours between the start and end times. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can find the total length of the melted candle by multiplying the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price, we can use the formula:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. 

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased and subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing, we can calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $16.50. Therefore, the total cost of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $22.50. Therefore, the total cost of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 times the cost of one pair, which is $42. Therefore, the total cost of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream, we can calculate the number of cartons Cynthia will purchase and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream per night and she needs 60 servings in 60 days, we can divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton to find the number of cartons required.

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost.

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by adding the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Therefore, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 40 + 15 = 55 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To find the cost of the boots, we can start by determining the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

Boots = 2 pairs of heels - $5

Substituting the cost of the two pairs of heels into the equation, we get:

Boots = $99 - $5
Boots = $94

Therefore, the boots cost $94."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To find the average of the three guesses, we need to add them together and divide by 3.

Let's denote the first guess as x. The second guess is 20 more than half of the first guess, which can be expressed as (x/2) + 20. The third guess is 25% more than the first guess, which can be expressed as 1.25x.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + ((x/2) + 20) + 1.25x = ?

Combine like terms:

2.25x + 20 = ?

Now, we need to find the value of x. However, we are not given a specific value for x. We can express the average as a formula:

Average = (x + (x/2) + 20 + 1.25x) / 3

Combine like terms:

Average = (2.25x + 20) / 3

Since we are not given a specific value for x, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we were given a specific value for x, we could calculate the average.

For the sake of providing a numerical answer, let's assume x = 80 (as one of the options). 

Average = (2.25(80) + 20) / 3
Average = (180 + 20) / 3
Average = 200 / 3
Average = 66.67

The average guess is 66.67."
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day. This yields 10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day.

Next, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, 5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as 40 / 2 = 20. Then, we add 5 to this result to find Aaron's total: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we can find out how many jewels Siobhan has. Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: 25 - 2 = 23.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = points in the first 20 minutes + points in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, we multiply the number of days by the daily consumption:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we need to find the cost of one yogurt. The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts:

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt:

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to analyze the situation. 

First, we calculate the total amount John received from selling his Lego sets. Since he sold 13 sets for $15 each, the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we consider the expenses. John spent $20 on 8 video games, resulting in a total expenditure of 8 * 20 = $160. After this purchase, he had $5 left. 

The total amount spent on video games and the remaining amount can be calculated as $195 - $160 = $35. This means John initially had $35 + $5 = $40.

Now, we know John initially had $40 and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find the number of Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, since John sold all his Lego sets, we need to find out how many he had initially. To do this, we can subtract the number of sets he sold (13) from the total number of sets he had before selling. Since we know he had 13 sets initially, he still has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine John's speed, we must first calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total hours he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can use the given information. Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as D.

We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S = 2 * 1 = 2.

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B = 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, we can set up the equation 3x = 1000 + 400 to find the distance she can throw with the gemstone.

Solving for x, we get x = 600. Now, we can find the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 3x = 3 * 600 = 1800.

To find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire from the maximum distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1800 - 1000 = 800.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as 'T' and the number of pieces taken as 'P'. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. We also know that the number of pieces remaining is 14. 

Using the equation T - P = 14, we can substitute the value of T and solve for P:

40 - P = 14

To isolate P, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the amount of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then find the corresponding weight.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories left by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 100g, we can find the weight of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the weight per serving.

0.8 * 100 = 80g

Therefore, you can eat 80g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost of the beeswax and wicks is:

Total cost = Number of candles made * Cost per candle
Total cost = 10 candles * $1.00 per candle
Total cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can break down the problem into parts.

First, we need to find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of articles on Tuesday = Number of articles on Monday + (2/5 * Number of articles on Monday)
= 5 + (2/5 * 5)
= 5 + 2
= 7

Now, we can calculate the total hours spent on Tuesday:
Total hours on Tuesday = Number of articles on Tuesday * Time per article
= 7 * 4
= 28

Next, we can calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday:
Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 * Number of articles on Tuesday
= 2 * 7
= 14

Now, we can calculate the total hours spent on Wednesday:
Total hours on Wednesday = Number of articles on Wednesday * Time per article
= 14 * 4
= 56

Finally, we can calculate the total hours spent on all three days:
Total hours = Total hours on Monday + Total hours on Tuesday + Total hours on Wednesday
= 20 + 28 + 56
= 104

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes Candice initially purchased as 'x'. We know that she had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work, with 23 notes remaining. 

The total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes in her purse and the notes used at work, plus the remaining notes. This can be expressed as:

x = 80 (initial notes in purse) + 220 (notes used at work) + 23 (remaining notes)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 323

However, this is the total number of notes Candice had initially. To find the number of notes in the package she purchased, we need to subtract the notes she already had in her purse:

Number of notes in the package = x - 80
= 323 - 80
= 243

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 243."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

First, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties as 'x'. Then, the number of red ties is 2x.

We are given that the cost of blue ties is $40 each. Therefore, the total cost of blue ties is 40x.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties, we can set up the equation:
40x = 200

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 40:
x = 200 / 40
x = 5

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties:
2x = 2(5)
2x = 10

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Therefore, the cost of a red tie is:
40 + (40 x 0.5)
40 + 20
60

The total cost of red ties is:
10 x 60
600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:
200 + 600
800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we must first convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches by multiplying 4 feet by 12 inches per foot.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Next, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we must first calculate the total number of units. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units can be found by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

15 * 8 = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:

3/4 * 120 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 - 90 = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine the weekly earnings of Lloyd's egg farm, we must first calculate the total number of eggs sold in a week. 

We know that the chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs sold in a week, we multiply this daily production by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we must first calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Given that the time elapsed is 3 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to return, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the comic books and toys removed, and then determine the number of toys to be removed.

Let's start by calculating the weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can find Patchy's total by multiplying 12 by 3. This gives us 36 kittens.

Next, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to calculate the number of lollipops remaining after she eats 2. This can be done by subtracting 2 from the initial number of lollipops, which is 30.

30 - 2 = 28

Next, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled. 

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we need to consider the total cost of the ticket and popcorn, which is $14. 

We can find the number of times he can go to the movies by dividing the total amount of money he has ($42) by the cost of the ticket and popcorn ($14).

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to consider the weight limit of the bridge and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

Let's denote the number of boxes as 'n'. The total weight of the boxes will be 15n pounds. Adding the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck (3755 pounds), we get a total weight of 15n + 3755 pounds.

Since the bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, we can set up the inequality:

15n + 3755 ≤ 5000

Subtracting 3755 from both sides:

15n ≤ 1245

Dividing both sides by 15:

n ≤ 83

Since 'n' represents the number of boxes, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to determine the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To determine the total number of raspberries, we can employ a straightforward approach. We have 6 clusters of 20 raspberries each, which can be calculated as 6 * 20 = 120. Additionally, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. To find the total, we simply add these two quantities together: 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we must first identify the total number of oranges that are not good. This includes the bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Next, we add the number of bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to consider the costs of the material, construction, and insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be found by multiplying $1300 by 0.1, which equals $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The total amount Janet paid is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider two periods: the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000, 5% of that is $2,500.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (first 20 years) + $2,500 (remaining 10 years) = $52,500

The final answer is: $52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial charge for the first half of the year and the reduced charge for the second half of the year.

The initial charge for the first half of the year is $140 per month, and there are 6 months in a half year. So, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the reduced charge is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon for Sophia's car, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the remaining capacity of the tank: 12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining.
2. Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon: 
   100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 8 gallons
3. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
   100 * 8 = 4x
   800 = 4x
   x = 800 / 4
   x = 200

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: hours spent watching TV and hours spent reading.

First, we calculate the hours spent watching TV. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of players and the number of coaches.

Each school has two teams, with five players on each team. Therefore, the total number of players per school is 2 teams * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are four schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

In addition to the players, each school has also sent a coach. With four schools participating, the total number of coaches is 4 coaches.

To find the overall total, we add the number of players and coaches together: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the different types of gems.

Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E. We know that:

D = 175
R = D - 35
E = 2R

We can substitute the expression for R into the equation for E:
E = 2(D - 35)
E = 2D - 70

Now, we can express the total number of gems as the sum of the individual types:
Total = D + R + E
Total = D + (D - 35) + (2D - 70)
Total = 4D - 105

Since we know the value of D, we can substitute it into the equation:
Total = 4(175) - 105
Total = 700 - 105
Total = 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we must first calculate the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Now, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher, which is 5. 

180 / 5 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, resulting in a total allowance of $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. 

We can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100

To solve for 'x', we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. There are 5 weekdays, and she teaches 5 classes per day, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 

Total classes in a week = 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total weekly earnings = Total number of students * Charge per student
= 495 * $15
= $7425

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in a week."
"To determine the total number of instructions, we can simply multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2, as the second recipe has twice as many instructions.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Total instructions = 20 + 40 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3) to find the total amount from the brownies: 43 * 3 = 129.

Next, we multiply the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4) to find the total amount from the cheesecakes: 23 * 4 = 92.

Finally, we add the total amounts from the brownies and cheesecakes to find the overall amount raised: 129 + 92 = 221.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to consider the cost of the cell phones and the interest charged on each unit.

The cost of each cell phone is $150, and a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. To find the monthly interest, we can calculate 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay each month is 5 x $153 = $765.

The answer is: $765"
"To calculate the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of pots of each flower by its respective price and then round the results to the nearest dollar.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $2.74 = $32.88, which rounds to $33
Petunias: 9 pots * $1.87 = $16.83, which rounds to $17
Begonias: 17 pots * $2.12 = $35.64, which rounds to $36

Now, let's add the rounded revenues together: $33 + $17 + $36 = $86

The final answer is: $86"
"To find the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series. The top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it. This forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/2.

The total square footage of the four levels can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the total square footage, a is the first term (16), r is the common ratio (1/2), and n is the number of terms (4).

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 30

Now, we can find the average square footage by dividing the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average = 30 / 4
Average = 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be 1 year old, and Cecilia will feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 365 = 730 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 730 = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 910 / 110 = 8.27 (round up to 9 bags, since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can start by establishing the relationship between their laundry amounts. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can express their laundry amounts as follows:

Let's denote David's laundry as D, Sarah's laundry as S, and Raymond's laundry as R. We know that S = 4D and R = S/2.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:

D = S / 4
D = 400 / 4
D = 100 pounds

Now, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:

R = S / 2
R = 400 / 2
R = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = R - D
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we need to calculate the total cost of buying them in both packages.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
The number of packages required is 18 / 3 = 6. Therefore, the total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
The number of packages required is 18 / 2 = 9. Therefore, the total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to find 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply $100 by 0.3.

$100 x 0.3 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls received. Since they each received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can multiply 24 by 1/6.

24 * 1/6 = 4 liters

Next, we add the 6 liters the boy received to the amount the girls received:
4 + 6 = 10 liters

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water given from the initial 24 liters:
24 - 10 = 14 liters

The amount of water left is 14 liters."
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Charlie initially had 10 stickers.
2. He acquired 21 stickers from a store and 23 stickers for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he now has is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.
3. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
4. He then used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, resulting in 45 - 28 = 17 stickers remaining.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can start by calculating Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can express this as an equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, we can find the combined weight by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds"
"To calculate the total number of thorns, we can use the fundamental principle of multiplication. We start by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
2. Multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of games won by adding 8 to x:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the number of games won is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Since Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

As Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can break down the problem into three parts.

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as 'a'. The second ring lasted three times as long, so its duration is 3a. The third ring lasted half as long as the second ring, so its duration is (3a)/2.

We know that the first ring lasted for 4 times, so we can set up the equation: a = 4.

Now, we can find the duration of each ring:
- The first ring lasted for 4 times.
- The second ring lasted for 3a = 3(4) = 12 times.
- The third ring lasted for (3a)/2 = (3(4))/2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the duration of each ring: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

The final answer is: $1556.25"
"To find the number of copies Harald sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is 8,000."
"To determine the total cost of the gift bags, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find 3/4 of the invited guests by multiplying 16 by 3/4.

(3/4) * 16 = 12

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Each bag costs $2, and Christina needs 12 bags. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

12 * $2 = $24

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for her party.

The final answer is: $24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required, we must consider the eating habits of both adults and children. 

First, we calculate the amount needed for the adults. Since each adult consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, we multiply the number of adults by this amount: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount needed for the children. It is given that children eat half as much as adults, so we multiply the number of children by half of the adult amount: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad required, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can use a step-by-step approach.

First, we know Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's pet count by adding 2 to Cindy's pet count: 4 + 2 = 6.

Next, we need to find Jan's pet count. We are told that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. To find Jan's pet count, we multiply Marcia's pet count by 3: 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the pet counts of all three individuals: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of the children.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy: A
- Jackson: J
- Corey: C
- James: 10 (given)

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = J + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)

We can substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to get:
A = (J + 1) - 2
A = J - 1

Now, we can equate this expression for A with equation (1):
J + 5 = J - 1

Subtracting J from both sides gives us:
5 = -1

This is a contradiction, indicating that the given information is inconsistent. However, we can still find a solution by using the given ages of James and Corey.

From equation (3), we know that C = J + 1. Since James is 10 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation:
10 = J + 1
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:
J = 9

Therefore, Jackson is 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the relationship between Lee's and Gerald's times. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39.6}$"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can start by using the information that there are two cats for every dog. Given that there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Next, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats:

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: $\boxed{348}$"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls.

Let's calculate the number of girls: 
Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we can use the concept of fractions. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hours James slept.

Let's denote the number of hours James slept as x. We know that x = (2/3) * 9. 

To find x, we can multiply 2/3 by 9: 
x = (2/3) * 9 = 6

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:
9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we must first calculate the total volume of tomatoes that Freda utilized. Since she lost half of the volume, we can find the original volume by doubling the amount of sauce she ended up with. 

The original volume of sauce is 32 ounces, so the total volume of tomatoes used is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes used, we can divide the total volume of tomatoes by 16 and then multiply by 3.

64 / 16 = 4
4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that the total number of cars is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she already has and then subtract the number of plants she plans to give away.

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants she already has by multiplying the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:
2 * 40 = 80

Next, we add the number of new plants she received to the total:
80 + 18 = 98

Since she plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, we subtract the number of ledges from the total:
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is 58."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

Let's denote the number of doorbell rings for the first friend as x. 

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell x + 10 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed the doorbell (1 + 1/4)x = (5/4)x times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell x times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + (x + 10) (third friend) + (5/4)x (second friend) + x (first friend) = 60 + x + 10 + (5/4)x + x

Combine like terms:
60 + 10 + (9/4)x = 70 + (9/4)x

To simplify the equation, multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
4(70 + (9/4)x) = 4(70) + 9x
280 + 9x = 280 + 9x

Now, we can see that the equation is an identity, and the value of x is not needed to find the total number of doorbell rings. However, we can express the total number of doorbell rings in terms of x:
Total doorbell rings = 70 + (9/4)x

Since we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
(5/4)x = 60
x = 60 * (4/5)
x = 48

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the total number of doorbell rings:
Total doorbell rings = 70 + (9/4)x
Total doorbell rings = 70 + (9/4)(48)
Total doorbell rings = 70 + 108
Total doorbell rings = 178

The total number of doorbell rings is 178."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the sum of the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has to complete the reading:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water per day for 5 days, resulting in a total of 5 glasses of water. 

On weekends, he drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday but not on Sunday. 

The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of his weekday consumption and his weekend consumption: 5 (weekdays) + 1 (Saturday) = 6 glasses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate.

Given that the city is 42 miles across and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 42 / 3 * 10
Time = 14 * 10
Time = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find a quarter of the total number of pieces: 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Next, we subtract this from the total to find the remaining pieces: 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, we calculate a third of the remaining pieces: 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Finally, we subtract this from the remaining pieces to find the final count: 750 - 250 = 500.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is 500."
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Since Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. Given that Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's amount by 3, resulting in 15 cookies. 

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by adding Amir's and Cody's consumption: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we must first calculate the total time spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The total time spent on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Converting 1.5 hours to minutes yields 90 minutes.

Dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes results in 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon: 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00.

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it is 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00.

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find out how many 20-foot intervals Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know that the shore was 64 seconds away, and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

We can find the total number of 20-foot intervals by dividing the total time it took to reach the shore (64 seconds) by the time it took to row 20 feet (16 seconds): 
64 / 16 = 4

Since Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, she rowed 4 x 20 feet in 4 x 16 seconds = 64 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on for each 20-foot interval. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 x 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 20 feet.

Since Julia rowed 64 feet, the boat took on 64 / 20 = 3.2 times 2 liters of water.

3.2 x 2 = 6.4 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{6.4}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can use the fundamental principles of multiplication. 

We have 4 teachers, each using the whiteboard 2 times a day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per use. 

The total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day can be calculated by multiplying the number of teachers, the number of lessons per day, and the number of cleanings per lesson: 

4 (teachers) * 2 (lessons per day) * 3 (cleanings per lesson) = 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can use the formula for calculating the total number of items when a fixed quantity is added over a specified period.

Let's break it down:

- The number of flowers planted per day is 2.
- The number of days is 15.

The total number of flowers can be calculated as follows:

Total flowers = (Number of flowers planted per day) * (Number of days)
Total flowers = 2 * 15
Total flowers = 30

However, we are told that 5 flowers did not grow. To find the actual number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total.

Actual flowers = Total flowers - Non-growing flowers
Actual flowers = 30 - 5
Actual flowers = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days."
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can start by dividing the total number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6, as his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

Let's denote the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as B. We know that the maximum number of photographs on Brittany's phone is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. This relationship can be expressed as:

B = 50x

where x is the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

1800 = 6B

Substituting B = 50x into the equation, we get:

1800 = 6(50x)
1800 = 300x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 300:

x = 1800 / 300
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

We then calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, we add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply this value by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 (approximately)

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the exact calculation yields a non-whole number, but the question does not explicitly state that the amount of sugar used must be a whole number. Nonetheless, given the context, we can reasonably assume that the amount of sugar used is a whole number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To calculate the total amount John paid, we can use the formula for multiplication. 

First, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes per child (2) by the number of children (3) to find the total number of pairs of shoes: 2 * 3 = 6.

Next, we multiply the total number of pairs of shoes (6) by the cost per pair ($60) to find the total cost: 6 * $60 = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as x.

We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can set up the equation:

10 + 5x = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

5x = 20

Dividing both sides by 5 gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $52000 + $43077.92 = $95077.92."
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month. 

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply 2 pads per week by 4 weeks:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

As there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we can then multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of fruits Morisette brought. She brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Next, we'll calculate the number of fruits Kael brought. He brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept, we can break down her sleep pattern for the week. 

Let's denote the hours she slept on Monday as M, and the hours she slept on the next two days as x. Since she slept 2 hours less each day, the hours for Tuesday and Wednesday would be x - 2. The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so the hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday would be x + 1.

We know that M = 8. We also know that the sum of the hours for the entire week is 8 + (x - 2) + (x - 2) + (x + 1) + (x + 1) + (x + 1) + (x + 1) = 8 + 4x + 6.

Since we know that the total hours slept is 40, we can set up the equation:

8 + 4x + 6 = 40

Combine like terms:

14 + 4x = 40

Subtract 14 from both sides:

4x = 26

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 6.5

Now that we know x, we can find the hours for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6.5 - 2 = 4.5 hours
- Wednesday: 4.5 - 2 = 2.5 hours
- Thursday: 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours
- Friday: 3.5 + 1 = 4.5 hours
- Saturday: 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 hours
- Sunday: 5.5 + 1 = 6.5 hours

Total hours slept: 8 + 4.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 4.5 + 5.5 + 6.5 = 35

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we can break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour. We can calculate the distance covered in this time period using the formula: distance = speed * time. Therefore, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a constant speed of 5 miles per hour. Again, using the same formula, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two time periods: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60. This means she put stamps on 60/3 = 20 letters.

After putting stamps on 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters becomes x + 20. We are given that this total is 30.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. We know that she initially had some spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can use the information provided. We know that he bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. 

Let's denote the number of fish sausages as x. Since there are 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can express the number of fish sausages as x = 38 + 6. 

x = 38 + 6
x = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought 82 sausages in total."
"To find the total number of friends, we can utilize the concept of addition. We are given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends. This implies that Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we can calculate the total number of friends by adding the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, we know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$. 

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges cost 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to consider the total time spent on patients and the revenue generated from both the hospital and the patients.

First, we calculate the total time spent on patients. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours: 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the doctors charge $150 an hour. The total revenue from patients is 500 people * $200/person = $100,000. The total revenue from doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000.

The total cost is the sum of the revenue from doctors, as the hospital does not incur any costs for the patients: $30,000.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000.

The final answer is: $100,000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to find the number of elves that remain after a third of them quit due to children vomiting on them. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of elves (60) by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Since 20 elves quit, we subtract this number from the original total to find the remaining elves.

60 - 20 = 40

Next, we need to account for the 10 elves that quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these from the remaining elves.

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we can simply add the expenditures for May and June.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940

Therefore, the total expenditure for the two months is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we can break down the problem into two parts: the roller coaster and the luge.

First, we calculate the total tickets used for the roller coaster. Pam rode it 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total tickets used for the roller coaster is (2 + 4) * 6 = 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.

Next, we calculate the total tickets used for the luge. Both Pam and Fred rode it 2 times, so the total tickets used for the luge is 2 * 2 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Now, we add the total tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge to find the overall total. 36 + 24 = 60 tickets.

The final answer is 60."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M and the miles walked on Wednesday as W. We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, so M = 4.

We are also given that Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday can be represented as 6M. Since we know M = 4, the miles walked on Tuesday are 6 * 4 = 24.

The total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is given as 41. We can set up an equation to represent this:

M + 6M + W = 41

Substituting M = 4, we get:

4 + 6(4) + W = 41

Simplifying the equation:

4 + 24 + W = 41

Combine like terms:

28 + W = 41

Subtract 28 from both sides:

W = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes in a year, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Car Washes per Year * Cost per Car Wash

Given that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

First, we multiply the number of car washes per month by the number of months in a year (12):

4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year

Next, we multiply the total number of car washes per year by the cost per car wash:

48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we must first calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of Scottish unicorns. Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of unicorns by 1/3.

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

Next, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to consider the cost of each item and the additional fees.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

A 20% delivery fee is applied to the total cost of the items, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order before the tip is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding a $5.00 tip to the total cost results in $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

First, we calculate the total number of questions Mark completed in the first test by multiplying the rate (5 questions per hour) by the time taken (8 hours): 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

Next, we calculate the total number of questions Mark completed in the second test by multiplying the rate (5 questions per hour) by the time taken (6 hours): 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

Now, we add the total number of questions completed in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, we add the total number of questions in both tests: 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

Finally, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in both tests to find the number of questions left incomplete: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

The final answer is 105."
"To determine the number of pink gumballs, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find the number of semi-automatic cars. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the different types of bees in the hive.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given the following information:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. From equation (2), we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Substituting B = 2Q into equation (1), we get:
W = 2(2Q)
W = 4Q

Now, substitute W = 4Q and B = 2Q into equation (3):
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees."
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of hours worked in a week by the hourly wage. 

First, we calculate the total hours worked in a week: 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Next, we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The total cost of the food items is $5 (milk and eggs). The non-food items include light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), and roach traps ($4), totaling $10. 

The tax rate is 10%, so we calculate the tax amount as $10 * 0.10 = $1. 

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11. 

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items (including tax): $5 + $11 = $16.

The total cost of everything is $16."
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients.

The cost of bleach can be calculated by multiplying the number of clients (8) by the number of bottles of bleach each client requires (2), then multiplying the result by the cost of each bottle ($2). This gives us:

8 * 2 = 16
16 * $2 = $32

Next, we calculate the cost of cloths by multiplying the number of clients (8) by the number of packs of cloths each client requires (1), then multiplying the result by the cost of each pack ($5). This gives us:

8 * 1 = 8
8 * $5 = $40

Now, we add the cost of bleach and cloths to find the total expenses:

$32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

Total income = $92
Total expenses = $72
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we must first calculate the total number of pineapples per year. 

We know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per year is:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box contains 500 pieces. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it contains 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it contains 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct periods.

First, we note that 30 bees leave the hive in the initial 6 hours. Then, half of these bees return in the subsequent 6 hours, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

Next, twice as many bees as the initial 6 hours leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. This means a total of 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees have left the hive in the first three periods.

Since 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that left in the first three periods and hadn't returned yet is 105 - 15 = 90 bees.

In the final 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left in the first three periods return. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

To find the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we add the total cost to the change she received: $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express Charlie's friends in terms of 'x' as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we must first convert the distances to a common unit. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle.

Next, we calculate the cost for tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25. 

Lastly, we calculate the cost for the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we add these amounts together: $1.25 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $3.75.

The final answer is: $3.75"
"To calculate the total cost of the cookies, we can multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply by the cost per cookie.

First, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: 
$10 - $6 = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards to find the initial number of french fries in the pack.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as 'x'. 

1. After the ants carried off 1 french fry, the remaining fries were 5. This implies that 5 = x - 1, so x = 6.

2. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'y'. Then, 1/3 of 'y' is 5. So, y = 5 * 3 = 15.

3. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries, so the remaining fries before the raccoon ate 15 - 2/3 * 15 = 15 - 10 = 5.

4. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries before the pigeons ate 5 + 9 = 14.

5. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7. Dave ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries.

6. Dave initially ate 14 fries.

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can break down his class schedule into two categories: 3-hour days and 4-hour days.

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, resulting in a total of 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. For the entire semester, which consists of 16 weeks, the total hours spent on these days is 9 * 16 = 144 hours.

On the other hand, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays, resulting in a total of 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours spent on these days per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. For the entire semester, the total hours spent on these days is 8 * 16 = 128 hours.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we add the hours spent on 3-hour days and 4-hour days: 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, we'll convert the length of each item to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. 

The length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. Converting to feet, we get 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

The length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet, we get 720 / 12 = 60 feet.

The length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches. Converting to feet, we get 2880 / 12 = 240 feet.

Now, we add the lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 240 feet = 400 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must consider the monthly requirements of each ape group and then calculate the total for a 2-month period.

First, we calculate the monthly requirements:
- The monkeys require 200 bananas per month.
- The gorillas require 400 bananas per month.
- The baboons require 100 bananas per month.

To find the total monthly requirement, we add these amounts together: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we must calculate the total distance each individual ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran (15) by the length of the football field (100 yards), resulting in 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated by first determining the total distance she ran back and forth on the entire field (100 yards * 2 = 200 yards), and then adding the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back (80 yards * 34 times = 2720 yards). Therefore, her total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 2920 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2920 - 1500 = 1420 yards.

The final answer is: 1420"
"To determine the total amount spent by Raphael, we can break down the costs of each item and calculate the sum.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 times the cost of one pen, which is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 times the cost of one notebook, which is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to consider the changes in the tadpole population.

Initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the current number of tadpoles, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's break it down:

- The total number of tadpoles initially observed is 11.
- 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, so we add 6 to the initial count: 11 + 6 = 17.
- However, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract 2 from the previous count: 17 - 2 = 15.

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, resulting in a total of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Next, we are told that the depth on Wednesday is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24 feet, we can multiply 24 by 2/3.

The calculation is as follows: (2/3) * 24 = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To determine the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Let's denote Anakin's catch as A and Locsin's catch as L. We know that Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

We can represent Locsin's catch in terms of Anakin's catch:
- Starfish: L = A - 5
- Sea horses: L = A - 3
- Clownfish: L = A + 2

Now, let's express Anakin's total catch in terms of A:
A = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

We can substitute A into the expressions for Locsin's catch:
- Starfish: L = 19 - 5 = 14
- Sea horses: L = 19 - 3 = 16
- Clownfish: L = 19 + 2 = 21

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Total = A + L = 19 + 14 + 16 + 21 = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price increases by 20% every 2 months, which can be represented as a geometric sequence.

The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

an = a1 * (1 + r)^(n-1)

where:
- an is the nth term
- a1 is the initial term (the initial price of the bag of marbles, which is $20)
- r is the common ratio (the percentage increase, which is 20% or 0.20)
- n is the number of terms (the number of 2-month periods, which is 36/2 = 18)

Plugging in the values, we get:

a18 = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^(18-1)
a18 = 20 * (1.20)^17
a18 ≈ 20 * 6.656
a18 ≈ 132.12

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $132.12.

The final answer is $132.12."
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to establish the cost of each type of toy.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * $4 + 3 * $5 + 1 * $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in earnings between doing taxes oneself and hiring an accountant, we must consider the lost income from reduced freelance work and the cost of hiring the accountant.

The lost income from reduced freelance work can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours lost (3) by the hourly wage ($35). This results in a loss of $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories can be found by adding the individual costs of each item:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

Since Elvira's budget is €1500, we can subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget to find the amount left for her clothing:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: €77"
"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we can divide the total number of eggs required (15) by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting (3).

This can be calculated as:

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the necessary eggs for the 15 Spanish flans."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote Seth's current age as x and Brooke's current age as y. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 2 + y + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

x + y + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x + y = 24

Now, we can substitute x = 2y into the equation:

2y + y = 24

Combine like terms:

3y = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 8

Now that we have found Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's current age by substituting y = 8 into the equation x = 2y:

x = 2(8)
x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Jimmy's total amount of money, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Ethel's money as E. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we can express Jimmy's money as 2E + 2.

We are given that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute E = 8 into the equation: 2E + 2 = 2(8) + 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To calculate the total miles walked in a week, we can break it down into two components: weekdays and weekends.

Let's start by calculating the miles walked on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

Next, we'll calculate the miles walked on weekends. There are 2 weekend days, and Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

Now, we can find the total miles walked in a week by adding the miles walked on weekdays and weekends. Total miles = 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we can break down the costs of the individual components.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can break it down into separate components and add them together.

First, we have 80 spiders with 8 legs each. This can be calculated as 80 x 8 = 640 legs.

Next, we have 90 insects with 6 legs each. This can be calculated as 90 x 6 = 540 legs.

Lastly, we have 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. This can be calculated as 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can break down the information as follows:

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.

Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine the total annual payment, we must first calculate the total monthly payment. 

The minimum payment for Jessica's debts consists of three components: student loans ($300), credit cards ($200), and mortgage ($500). The sum of these minimum payments is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. This is equivalent to 0.5 x $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 

First, we convert the time to peel one potato into seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds. Then, we add the time to cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

Converting the total time to minutes for easier understanding: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we must first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The selling price per glass is $0.50, and 20 glasses are produced per gallon. Therefore, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since the profit is $25, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This represents the total cost for 1 gallon. Since the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon to find the cost of lemons:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $35.

Final Answer: The final answer is 35."
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we must first calculate the total number of Chinese participants. 

The total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine Zaid's remaining balance, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract it from his monthly income.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. 

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$. 

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$. 

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$. 

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$. 

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$. 

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$. 

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can start by establishing the number of crabs each person possesses.

Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R. We are given the following information:

1. B = 40 (Bo has 40 crabs)
2. M = B - 4 (Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo)
3. R = M + 10 (Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic)

We can substitute the value of B into the equation for M:
M = 40 - 4
M = 36

Next, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for R:
R = 36 + 10
R = 46

Now, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has:
Total = B + M + R
Total = 40 + 36 + 46
Total = 122

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three individuals have together is 122."
"To calculate the total earnings for the first two weeks, we can use the formula for total earnings: Total Earnings = (Number of hours worked in the first week) * Hourly wage + (Number of hours worked in the second week) * Hourly wage.

Given that Lloyd earns $10 per hour, worked 5 hours in the first week, and 8 hours in the second week, we can plug these values into the formula:

Total Earnings = (5 hours * $10/hour) + (8 hours * $10/hour)
Total Earnings = $50 + $80
Total Earnings = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can use the fact that the winner received 3/4 of the total votes. 

Let's denote the total number of votes as 'x'. Since the winner received 3/4 of the total votes, the number of votes the winner received is (3/4)x. 

We know that the total number of votes is 80, so we can set up the equation:

(3/4)x = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

Now that we know the total number of votes, we can find the number of votes the loser received by subtracting the number of votes the winner received from the total:

Number of votes the loser received = Total votes - Number of votes the winner received
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be expressed as 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. This relationship can be written as 5x = 200, where 200 represents the number of pink calla lilies. Solving for x, we find that x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can calculate the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40, which gives us 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of equations.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. E = M + 2 (since Jean is two years older than Mark)
2. M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5 (since two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

Substituting J = 30 into equation (2), we get:

M - 2 = (30 / 2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using equation (1):

E = M + 2
E = 22 + 2
E = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can calculate the total time for each team.

The first runner on the less well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3 seconds.

The time for each runner on the less well-rounded team can be calculated as follows:

Runner 1: 60 seconds
Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is the sum of these individual times:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The time difference between the two teams is:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = (0.5 - 0.1111) * 100% ≈ 58.89%

Therefore, Jerry is approximately 58.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 58.89%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we can use the concept of ratios. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can represent this as a ratio: Jenna's apples : mom's apples = 1 : 2.

Given that her mom picked 20 apples, we can set up a proportion to find Jenna's apples: 1/2 = x/20, where x represents the number of apples Jenna picked.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1 * 20 = 2x, which simplifies to 20 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding Jenna's apples to her mom's apples: 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw used is 160, the number of straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for rats is 3 x 6 = 18.

Since 90 pieces of straw are used for rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces, the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay to Benedict, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Amount = Principal + (Principal * Rate * Time)

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months.

Amount = $100 + ($100 * 0.02 * 3)
Amount = $100 + $6
Amount = $106

Therefore, Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is 30x. The total cost consists of the cost per bag ($20) and the transportation cost ($2 per bag), making the total cost 22x. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400.

We can set up the equation as follows:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total cost of the food, we can subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is $66.

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we can divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can use the formula:

Total peaches = Number of hours * Number of peaches per hour

Given that John collects peaches for 3 hours and can collect 2 peaches per minute, we first need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute: 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for the flock of ducks, we can divide the total weekly requirement by 7.

The total weekly requirement is 3.5 pounds. 

Dividing this by 7 days in a week yields:

3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day

Therefore, the ducks require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, we need to find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years. Since he plants 10 trees per year, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Next, we need to account for the trees that Tom chops down. He chops down 2 trees per year, so we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping. To do this, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

Therefore, Tom has 56 trees left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are now 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we must first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she requires 5 crayons at $2 each, the total cost can be found by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Now, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount Violetta has.

Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change."
"To determine the cost of a pen, we must first calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

The cost of a pen is the sum of these two costs: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we can use simple division. 

We have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed among 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds. 

First, we divide the total amount of carrots by the number of restaurants to find the amount each restaurant will receive: 200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant.

Since each restaurant is receiving 2 pounds, we can find the amount of carrots not used by subtracting the amount distributed from the amount each restaurant would have received if all were given 5 pounds: 5 pounds - 2 pounds = 3 pounds.

Therefore, 3 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the concept of set theory. The total population consists of men, women, and children. We are given the number of men (8417) and women (9092), and we know the total population is 23786.

Let's denote the number of children as 'x'. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can set up the following equation:

Total population = Number of men + Number of women + Number of children
23786 = 8417 + 9092 + x

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting the sum of men and women from the total population:

x = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
x = 23786 - 17509
x = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of cards collected in the first month. Since Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, we multiply the initial number of cards (20) by 3. This gives us 20 * 3 = 60 cards.

Next, we calculate the number of cards collected in the second month. Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so we subtract 20 from the number of cards collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. To find the combined total, we add the number of cards collected in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100. Then, we multiply this sum by 2 to find the number of cards collected in the third month: 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, we add up the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Next, we know that Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. To find the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark makes from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

Finally, to find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amount he makes from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must calculate the morning and afternoon amounts separately and then sum them.

The morning amount is 5 pails multiplied by 5 liters per pail, which equals 25 liters. 

The afternoon amount is 6 pails multiplied by 5 liters per pail, which equals 30 liters.

The total daily amount is the sum of these two values: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

The final answer is 55."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary. However, since the raise is a percentage of his salary, we must first determine his new salary after the raise.

John's current weekly salary is $2000. A 5% raise would be calculated as:
$2000 * 0.05 = $100

Adding the raise to his current salary:
$2000 + $100 = $2100

Since the raise is a percentage of his current salary, not his total earnings, we can calculate his total earnings for the year by multiplying his new salary by the number of weeks in a year:
$2100 * 52 = $109,400

The monetary reward of $5000 is a one-time payment, so it should be added to his total earnings:
$109,400 + $5000 = $110,400

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $110,400.

Final answer: $110,400"
"To calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced, we can use a straightforward multiplication approach. 

First, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must consider the various instances of cheese consumption throughout the week.

Carl's lunch consisted of a sandwich every day, with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of slices used for lunch is 2 * 7 = 14.

For breakfast, Carl consumed cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, utilizing one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Given that he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. Consequently, the total number of slices used for breakfast is 3 * 3 = 9.

Additionally, Carl prepared a large dish of macaroni and cheese, employing 8 slices of cheese.

To calculate the total number of slices of cheese used, we sum the slices from each meal: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. She then acquired 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, resulting in 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. Additionally, she purchased 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, yielding 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens together:
22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we need to consider the following steps:

First, we calculate the total score of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we identify the lowest score as 71. We then subtract this score from the total: 
438 - 71 = 367

Next, we determine the desired total score for six tests, which is the average score multiplied by the number of tests. The desired average is 93, and there are six tests, so the desired total score is: 
93 * 6 = 558

Finally, we find the required score for the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. This can be calculated as 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers.

To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we add the kilometers from both periods: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Next, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups.

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to earn. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 x 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

5x + 4y = 60

where x is the number of babysitting sessions and y is the number of lawn mowing sessions.

We can solve for x by trying different values of y. However, a more efficient approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 4, which is 20. We can then divide 60 by 4 to find the number of lawn mowing sessions:

60 ÷ 4 = 15

Since 15 is a multiple of 4, Sara can earn the required amount by mowing the lawn 15 times.

Final answer: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can start by finding the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this total is 250.

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150).

To find the number of customers on the third day, we know that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. We can set up an equation using the total number of customers on the first two days (100 + 150 = 250) and the total number of customers on the third day (500):

250 + y = 500

Subtract 250 from both sides:

y = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is 250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

2. Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

4. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

5. We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

6. We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

7. Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative. We need to re-evaluate our steps.

8. Let's re-evaluate our steps. We can set up the equation 2x - 16 = 4y and 2x - 32 = 4y.

9. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get -16 = 0, which is not true. This means our initial assumption that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago was incorrect.

47. Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

48. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

49. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons of water, it now has 2x - 16 gallons of water. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

50. We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool now has y gallons of water, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

51. We can solve the system of equations by substituting x - 16 for y in the first equation: 2(x - 16) - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 48 = 4x - 64. Adding 48 to both sides, we get 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

52. Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 8 - 16 = y, so y = -8. However, this doesn't make sense, as the amount of water in the small pool can't be negative. We need to re-evaluate our steps.

53. Let's re-evaluate our steps. We can set up the equation 2x - 16 = 4y and 2x - 32 = 4y.

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, we find 10% of the initial amount: 0.1 x $2000 = $200. The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay: $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can use the information provided. We know that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses. This means the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we must first determine their current ages.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can deduce that Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by finding the total points scored by the other three students. 

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so we can express Yuri's points as Y = (N/2) + 10. Substituting N = 68, we get Y = (68/2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we can express Brianna's points as B = N + 17. Substituting N = 68, we get B = 68 + 17 = 85.

Now, we can find the total points scored by the three students: N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the total points: J = 251 - 197 = 54.

The final answer is 54."
"To determine the total time spent on these activities, we can calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then add them together.

The time spent on crossword puzzles can be found by multiplying the number of puzzles (3) by the time it takes to complete one crossword puzzle (10 minutes), which gives us 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles can be found by multiplying the number of puzzles (8) by the time it takes to complete one sudoku puzzle (5 minutes), which gives us 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles (30 minutes) and sudoku puzzles (40 minutes), resulting in a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the amount of water left after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters. This can be calculated as follows:

Initial amount of water - Amount used = Amount left
120 - 90 = 30 liters

Next, we are told that the collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining amount by 2:

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can simply add the number of geraniums and petunias.

Let's denote the number of geraniums as G and the number of petunias as P. We know that G = 90 and P = G - 40. 

Substituting the value of G into the equation for P, we get P = 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding G and P: Total = G + P = 90 + 50 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of $15,000.

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we can calculate the cost for each individual separately and then add them together.

Carlos' cost can be found by multiplying the number of hours he used the boat (3 hours) by the hourly rate ($30). This gives us 3 * $30 = $90.

Similarly, Benji's cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours he used the raft (5 hours) by the hourly rate ($18). This gives us 5 * $18 = $90.

To find the total cost, we add the costs of both rentals together: $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. 
The car trip from Rochester to New Jersey takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type card from James' collection, we must first calculate the total number of cards he possesses. 

James initially has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 water-type cards, he is left with 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards. He also acquires 14 grass-type cards, bringing his total grass-type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards James now has is the sum of his fire-type, grass-type, and water-type cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

The probability of selecting a water-type card is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability of selecting a water-type card is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to consider the individual components and their respective costs.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Next, the avocado adds $1.00, making the total $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Two sauces at $0.25 each amount to $0.50, bringing the total to $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. Finally, the upgrade for $3.00 increases the total to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which reduces the total cost to $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to consider their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time required to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we first need to calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 watermelons is 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining watermelons after the initial harvest. 

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Then, we calculate 3/4 of the remaining watermelons to find out how many were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Now, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the number not ready for harvest.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be found by multiplying the number of cars (12) by the price per car ($20,000). This gives us a total of $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax by taking 10% of the total cost of the cars. This is equivalent to 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we calculate the registration fees by multiplying the number of cars (12) by the registration fee per car ($1,000). This gives us a total of $12,000.

To find the overall cost, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees together: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate her Monday collection as 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

Next, we are told that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. To find her Tuesday collection, we multiply her Monday collection by 2: 25 * 2 = 50 shells.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio: bugs:ants = 1:2.

We are provided with the number of ants, which is 50. To find the number of bugs, we can multiply the number of ants by the ratio of bugs to ants, which is 1/2.

Number of bugs = (1/2) * 50
= 25

Now, we can calculate the total number of insects by adding the number of bugs and ants.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. 

One-third of the penguins, which is 36 / 3 = 12, jumped into the ocean. Another one-third, also 36 / 3 = 12, went inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

The total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24. 

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12.

**Answer: 12**"
"To determine the number of vines required, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he consumes 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend consumes half of that amount, which is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

The total number of tomatoes consumed per day is 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find the total number of tomatoes consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To determine the number of vines required, we divide the total number of tomatoes consumed per week by the number of tomatoes produced per vine: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet the demand for tomatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use the concept of division. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants to distribute 4 slices among his 20 friends, we can set up the following equation:

Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza = Total number of slices needed

Let's denote the number of pizzas as 'x'. We know that the total number of slices needed is 20 friends × 4 slices per friend = 80 slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we can set up the equation:

8x = 80

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 80 ÷ 8
x = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Since Ram can make one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This calculation yields a quotient of 5, indicating that Ram can create 5 full pens from the initial 25 pens. As a result, Ram will have a total of 5 pens.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the total amount of money Johnny had before it tripled. We know he started with $20 and added $10 to it. So, the total amount before tripling is $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we need to find the amount after it tripled. To do this, we multiply the initial amount by 3. 

$30 * 3 = $90

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year."
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as O, and Mary's age as M. We are given the following relationships:

1. J = 20
2. O = J + 5
3. M = O - 2

We can substitute the value of J into the second equation to find O:
O = 20 + 5
O = 25

Now, we can substitute the value of O into the third equation to find M:
M = 25 - 2
M = 23

To find the sum of their ages, we can add J, O, and M:
Sum = J + O + M
Sum = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum = 68

The final answer is 68."
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. This can be calculated by finding 30% of the total number of students, which is 1000. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. This can be calculated by finding 3/5 of the remaining students.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.

700 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that John has twice as many candies as Robert. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'x'. Since John has twice as many candies, we can express John's candies as 2x.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2x = 54 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's amount: 27 + 6 = 33.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can use a simple addition principle. 

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time spent writing per week, we must first calculate the total number of letters written and received. Since Mike has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, the total number of letters received is 3 * 2 = 6. As he responds in kind, the total number of letters sent is also 6. Therefore, the total number of letters written and received per week is 6 + 6 = 12.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 12 * 5 = 60.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss and the extra minutes used for calls to other people.

First, we calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy then took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to first determine the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, resulting in 24 hours per week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly rate of $250. This gives us 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000. Subtracting the discount from the total cost, we get $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Therefore, the total amount paid by the makeup artist is $27,000."

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula: Total Cost = Number of Bags * Weight per Bag * Cost per Pound.

Given:
- Number of Bags = 4
- Weight per Bag = 50 pounds

Total Cost = 4 * 50 * $1.50
Total Cost = 200 * $1.50
Total Cost = $300

Therefore, the total cost is $300."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday. Since she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, we can multiply her sister's cookies by 4.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister. 
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each person.
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.
Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is 5600."
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

Since 30 students are girls, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30 boys.

Since the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 boys, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we must consider the changes in the number of apps. 

First, we subtract the number of apps deleted from the initial number of apps: 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps downloaded to this result: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the number of wolves and the number of cougars.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W and the number of cougars killed last night as C. We are given that W = 10 and C = 15.

We are also given that today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so the number of wolves killed today is 3C = 3(15) = 45.

Additionally, we know that the number of cougars killed today is three fewer than the number killed last night, so the number of cougars killed today is C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed:

Total wolves = W + 45 = 10 + 45 = 55
Total cougars = C + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 55 + 27 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Bill's starting floor as 'x'. The problem states that he rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. This can be expressed as 4x + 6.

Since Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can set up the equation:

4x + 6 = 3

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides:

4x = -3

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = -3/4

However, since we're dealing with floors, we can't have a fraction. We can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

x = -3

But this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-examine the original equation. We can rewrite it as 4x = 3 - 6, which simplifies to 4x = -3. This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6, we can set up the equation as 4x + 6 = y, where y is the floor Bill is on now. We know that x = 3, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

4(3) + 6 = y
12 + 6 = y
y = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can start by finding the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
To find the number of times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

The initial number of cows in each stall is 20. When 40 new cows are added and divided among the 20 stalls, the number of cows in each stall becomes:
20 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) / 20 stalls = 6 cows per stall.

Now, we can find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls by multiplying the number of cows per stall by 8:
6 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 48 cows.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to consider the value of each type of currency.

First, let's calculate the value of the coins:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Next, we add the value of the dollar bills: 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee separately. 

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, the total amount Nancy owes is $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Then, the number of apples Andrea has is 'x + 8'. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 52 - 8
x = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has by adding 4 to 44:
Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. This can be found by adding the number of cookies she plans to make today to the number of cookies she plans to make tomorrow.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can find the total amount of flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by 12 and then multiplying by 2.

Total flour needed = (66 / 12) * 2

First, divide 66 by 12:
66 ÷ 12 = 5.5

Then, multiply 5.5 by 2:
5.5 * 2 = 11

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find two thirds of the total number of pennies. This can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To calculate this, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide the result by 3.

9,300 * 2 = 18,600

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is $62."
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 * 50 = 250. 

Next, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of trees Chris has as C, the number of trees Ferdinand has as F, and the number of trees Harry has as H.

We are given that C = 6.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so H = 2F + 5 = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can use the concept of addition. 

Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as C, Samantha has as S, and Daisy has as D. We are given the following information:

C = 100
S = C + 25
D = S + 50

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for D:
D = (C + 25) + 50
D = C + 75

Now, we can add up the amounts:
C + S + D = C + (C + 25) + (C + 75)
= 3C + 100

Since we know C = 100, we can substitute this value into the equation:
= 3(100) + 100
= 300 + 100
= 400

Therefore, the total amount of money the girls have is $400."
"To determine the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Adding this to the selling price, we get $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price. This can be found by multiplying the selling price by 0.03.

Transfer fees = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This can be found by multiplying the selling price by 0.05.

Brokerage fee = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

The total amount paid is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

Total amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price.

Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $368,000."
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its components.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. This can be done by adding 40% of the initial 20 minutes to the initial 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. So, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we add the heating time and the cooking time to get the total time. The total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50). This gives us a total of $250.

Next, we calculate the total amount spent on television ads by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15), resulting in a total of $1125.

Finally, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The total amount spent on buying all the ads is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can break down the problem into its components. 

First, we know that the juggler can juggle a total of 16 balls. Since half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2. 

16 ÷ 2 = 8

This means there are 8 golf balls in total. Now, we are told that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2.

8 ÷ 2 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary received, we must calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag, however, has a hole in it, resulting in half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, which is 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary received is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows, we must consider the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 3 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 6 windows per house. With 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 windows per house * 2 houses = 12 windows.

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Each house has 4 additional windows, so we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual item prices: 
Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounded to the nearest cent) = $15.99

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

Therefore, the cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we must first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we can calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet, which equals $800. 

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet, which equals $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is the sum of these two amounts: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total cost of the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into parts.

Let's denote the number of lines in the first scene as x. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, we can express this as x = 2 * 54. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has x/3 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

We also know that the song has 54 lines. To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + x/3 + 48.

Since x = 2 * 54, we can substitute this value into the equation: 54 + (2 * 54)/3 + 48.

First, calculate 2 * 54: 2 * 54 = 108.

Now, divide 108 by 3: 108/3 = 36.

Now, add 54, 36, and 48: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards have the letter A, we calculate (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we subtract the cards with the letter A from the total to find the remaining cards: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B, which is 1/2 of the remaining cards: (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards with the letter B from the remaining cards: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

We then calculate the number of cards with the letter C, which is 5/8 of the remaining cards: (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the cards with the letter C from the remaining cards: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we can calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the total time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the total time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes to get the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by representing their current ages as variables. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C.

We are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be expressed as an equation: M + C = 20.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. This results in M + 10 and C + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years can be calculated by adding the two expressions: (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that S = 6.

Therefore, the current age of Sam is 6 years.

The final answer is 6."

First, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.
Next, we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.
Finally, we add the two amounts together: $5 + $2 = $7.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To determine the total number of spots, we must first establish the number of spots on each species. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

We are given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. To find the total number of spots, we can calculate the spots for each species separately and then sum them.

For cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
For mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total number of people, we must consider the team members, coaches, and their guests. 

First, we calculate the number of guests: 12 team members * 2 guests per team member = 24 guests. 

Next, we add the number of team members and coaches: 12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 individuals.

Now, we add the number of guests to the total number of individuals: 24 guests + 15 individuals = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

The cost of pizzas is calculated by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the gemstones is 8 inches, so the length of the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to consider the number of stories each child wrote in the first week and double it for the second week.

Let's start by doubling the number of stories each child wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can start by finding his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age as follows:

Current age = 2 * Ann's age
Current age = 2 * 9
Current age = 18 years

Now, to find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
Age in 3 years = Current age + 3
Age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Age in 3 years = 21 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the item.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 = 20 cents. Therefore, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars on the flag. 

We know that there are 3 rows of 8 stars, contributing 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Additionally, there are 2 rows of 6 stars, contributing 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 

The total number of stars on the flag is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the total number of 5-star rows by 5. 

40 / 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. 

The weight of each flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. Therefore, the total weight is:

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we can find the number of trucks needed by dividing the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks are required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can utilize the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can apply the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the number of medals given out for counting is 'x'. We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 22 + 17 = 39. According to the problem, this is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. We can set up the equation:

39 = (1/10)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we must first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars distributed to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars, which are 40 - 24 = 16, are to be shared equally among the children. With 8 children, each child will receive 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is 2."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes by multiplying the hours worked by 60. 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 

480 minutes - 30 minutes = 450 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can find the number of 10-minute intervals by dividing the total minutes worked by 10. 

450 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 45 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 

45 intervals * $5/interval = $225

The final answer is: $225"
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we first need to establish their initial point totals. 

Let's denote Mike's points as M, Jim's points as J, and Tony's points as T. We are given the following information:

1. M = 21
2. J = M - 3
3. T = 2M

We can calculate Jim's and Tony's initial points using the given equations:

J = M - 3
J = 21 - 3
J = 18

T = 2M
T = 2 * 21
T = 42

Now, we need to consider the distribution of extra points in the fourth round. Since all players have more than 20 points, they will receive an additional point each.

M = 21 + 1
M = 22

J = 18 + 1
J = 19

T = 42 + 1
T = 43

To find the total points of all three players, we add their updated point totals:

Total points = M + J + T
Total points = 22 + 19 + 43
Total points = 84

The final answer is 84."
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washed 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (from the oldest son) + 4 (from the youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Since Will initially bought 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we can break down the calculations as follows:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of these individual totals: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

To find the number of weeks the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg):

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates he sold. 

We know that Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. To find the total number of crates sold, we add these values together: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is 55."
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can break down the process into steps. 

First, we need to find the total amount bid by the other three individuals. Since each bid increases by $50, we can calculate the total amount they bid as follows:

$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

Next, we need to find Carmen's total bids. Since she bids after each of the other three individuals, her bids are $200, $250, and $300. 

Now, we add the cost of the desk to the total amount bid by the other three individuals and Carmen's last bid:

$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100 (bids by others)
$200 + $250 + $300 = $750 (Carmen's bids)
$1100 + $750 = $1850

The final answer is: $1850"
"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to consider two components: the cost of driving and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the cost of driving plus the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he spent exercising on Monday and Sunday.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the problem by considering the number of pages printed on each side of the tabloid.

Since the tabloid is folded in half, we have two sides: left and right. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

When folding the tabloid, each page is printed on two sides: front and back. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of pages on each side by 2.

For the left side, we have 16 pages * 2 = 32 pieces of paper.
For the right side, we have 16 pages * 2 = 32 pieces of paper.

In total, we need 32 + 32 = 64 pieces of paper.

However, this calculation assumes that each page is printed on both sides. Since the problem doesn't specify this, we need to consider the possibility that each page is printed on only one side.

In this case, we can simply multiply the number of pages by 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can use a straightforward subtraction approach. 

Annika initially had $50. She spent $25 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides. 

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount:

$50 - $25 - $10 = $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can start by establishing the number of books sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Given that 90 books were sold in the first year, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the bonus he receives.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours worked in a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, his total hours worked for the month are 50 * 4 = 200 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so his total earnings from hourly wages are 200 * $10 = $2000.

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the month, as the company performed well. Therefore, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate 20 x 0.8, as 80% is equivalent to 0.8.

20 x 0.8 = 16

Therefore, John lost to 16 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales. 

We know that two-thirds of the total loaves are sold in the morning. This can be expressed as (2/3) * 60. To find the number of loaves remaining, we subtract the morning sales from the total: 60 - (2/3) * 60.

To simplify the calculation, we can first find the value of (2/3) * 60, which is 40. Then, we subtract 40 from 60 to get 20 loaves remaining.

Now, we need to find half of the remaining loaves, which is (1/2) * 20. This simplifies to 10 loaves.

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can use a simple proportion. 

Let's denote the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as 'x'. Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 'x' weeks as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we can set up the following proportion:

x weeks / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week / 8 pounds

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

x * 8 = 4 * 2

x * 8 = 8

Now, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 8 / 8

x = 1

Therefore, it will take Sandy 1 week to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is 1."
"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the difference between the original cost and the discounted cost.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated by subtracting the total discounted cost from the total original cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we can analyze the growth pattern of the extra arms and legs.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days, which means they will have 5 sets of 3-day intervals in 15 days. This results in 5 extra arms.

Similarly, the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, which means they will have 3 sets of 5-day intervals in 15 days. This results in 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. Additionally, the cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Furthermore, the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500, resulting in a total of $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of these items is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, we subtract this amount from Theo's total budget of $6000 to find the remaining amount available for gifts: $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since Theo wishes to save $2000, we subtract this from the remaining amount: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Let's denote the number of people who eat three eggs per day as 'a' and the number of people who eat two eggs per day as 'b'. We are given that a = 3 and b = 2.

The total number of eggs consumed per day can be represented as 3a + 2b. Substituting the given values, we get 3(3) + 2(2) = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

Given that Quinn is 30 years old, we have:
Q = 30

We also know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we can express Jane's age as:
J = Q - 3
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we can express Trent's age as:
T = J + 5
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:

Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago.
Noah's age six years ago = 40

Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
Noah's current age = 40 + 6
Noah's current age = 46

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile:
Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
Population of Chile now = 2 * 120000
Population of Chile now = 240000

The final answer is: $oxed{240000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of people who attended Martha's party, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 28 (new marbles) + 50 (store marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we must first determine the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the pool, is found by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can break down the information into parts. 

First, we know the number of boys is 30. Since the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, we can calculate the number of girls as 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we're told that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys. So, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can use the concept of ratios. The given ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 electric wires. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since each set of 3 electric wires requires 1 electric pole, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can start by finding the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we know that 22 men stayed, we can calculate the total number of people who left.

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' left, and 22 men stayed. Since 3 men left, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = (1/4) * 12 = 3

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P. We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, which costs $4. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

M = 1/2 * 4
M = 2

We also know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can express this relationship as:

P = M - 1
P = 2 - 1
P = 1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider two factors: the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

Let's start by calculating the weakening caused by the cooling. The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream. Therefore, the total weakening is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of old records the 5 people brought in as 'x'. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x.

We know that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is equal to the number of people, which is 5. However, this information is not directly necessary for our calculation. What we actually need is the total number of old records traded, which is 2x.

Since the problem states that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can set up the equation 2x = 7. However, this equation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct approach is to realize that the 7 new records were obtained by trading 5 old records. Since each trade involves 2 old records, we can set up the equation 5 = 2x/2, which simplifies to 5 = x.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 5 old records.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers, which is 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can find their salary by adding $400 to the junior programmer's salary.

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total salary of junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total salary of senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total salaries of junior and senior programmers.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is x = 5 + 8.

However, we are also given that 7 people got off at the second stop, and the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 5 + 8 - 7 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 14

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events as follows:

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that affect the number of lollipops he has.

First, he eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, reducing his total to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, he purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This increases his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Subsequently, he consumes 3 lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, reducing his total to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we start with Erin's initial number of lollipops, which is 7. Then, her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, increasing the total to 7 + 10 = 17. Finally, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, resulting in 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The correct answer is: 14"
"To determine the amount the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $8 = $72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must calculate the net income for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B provides a higher net pay of $32,400. To find the difference, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we need to find 40% of the total number of castles in Scotland, which is 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Next, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the result by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and then divide by the number of people.

The total number of guns can be found by adding the individual counts: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

To find the number of guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people: 24 ÷ 4 = 6.

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for suckers and fudge separately and then sum them.

First, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amounts together: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we can break down the process into two steps: the increase in the first year and the decrease in the second year.

First, we calculate the increase in the first year. The initial price of each share is $8, and the increase is 50%. To find 50% of $8, we multiply $8 by 0.5, which equals $4. Adding this increase to the initial price, we get $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the decrease in the second year. The price after the first year is $12, and the decrease is 25%. To find 25% of $12, we multiply $12 by 0.25, which equals $3. Subtracting this decrease from the price after the first year, we get $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate Thomas's hot dogs as 3 * 2 = 6.

Next, we know that John ate half the amount Thomas ate. To find John's hot dogs, we divide Thomas's hot dogs by 2: 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find the difference between John's and Luke's hot dogs. We subtract Luke's hot dogs from John's hot dogs: 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of students in the smallest group be x. Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students.

We are also given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. This relationship can be expressed as:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

Therefore, the smallest group has 105 students."
"To determine the total number of legs, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cows as x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has, and add them together:

20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs
40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we can calculate the total number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. 

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

At the end of the fourth week, Josh has 6 balls. However, he drops 3 balls, and 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. 

6 - 1 = 5 balls.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to each animal's weight. Let's use F for the pink frog, B for the blue beetle, T for the green toad, S for the yellow snake, and R for the red bird.

We are given the following information:

1. F = B
2. F = T
3. F = S - 10
4. F = R + 20

We are also given that the container weighs 20 pounds.

Since F = B, we can substitute B with F in the equation F = B. This gives us F = F, which is true for any value of F.

From F = T, we can substitute T with F, giving us F = F, which is also true for any value of F.

From F = S - 10, we can substitute F with 50 (since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds) to find S:
50 = S - 10
S = 60

From F = R + 20, we can substitute F with 50 to find R:
50 = R + 20
R = 30

Now, we can find the total weight by adding the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtracting the weight of the red bird:
Total weight = F + B + T + S + container weight - R
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20 - 30
Total weight = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower. Since Laurel received twice the amount of outfits given by her friend, we can multiply the number of outfits given by her friend (24) by 2.

24 * 2 = 48

Next, we add the number of outfits received at the baby shower to the number of outfits given by her friend.

48 + 24 = 72

Finally, we add the number of outfits gifted by her mom to the total.

72 + 15 = 87

Therefore, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her child."
"To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to first determine the new daily distance. The original distance is 5000 meters, and the coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. Therefore, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, we can find the total distance covered by multiplying the new daily distance by the number of days: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180,000}$"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can start by finding the price of each box.

Juice Box A is priced at $4. 
Since Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, its price is $4 + $5 = $9.
Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, we can calculate the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can use the concept of weighted averages. We have two types of tables: those with 4 legs and those with 3 legs. 

Let's denote the number of tables with 4 legs as 'x' and the number of tables with 3 legs as 'y'. We are given that x = 40 and y = 50.

The total number of legs can be represented as 4x + 3y. Substituting the given values, we get:

Total number of legs = 4(40) + 3(50)
= 160 + 150
= 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to find 40% of the original price of one shirt and subtract it from the original price.

First, find 40% of $30:
40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:
$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:
$18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the current and past periods.

The factory previously sold 10 tractors at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos at $220 each, generating a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on the dog per year, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure. 

The cost of food is $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Additionally, the monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100. 

The total monthly expenditure is the sum of these costs: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

The yoga class on Monday lasts 1 hour. The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class, so it lasts 3 hours. The cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is 0.5 hours long. The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, so it lasts 1.5 hours. Finally, Peyton dedicates 2 hours to errands on Friday.

Now, let's add the hours together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we first need to calculate the total number of pots required. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she requires 30 pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

The total number of pots required is the sum of the pots needed for the daisies and roses, which is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots required from the initial amount: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we must consider the total amount she had initially and the expenses incurred. 

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. We know that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. The total amount spent is the sum of these two expenses, which is $11 + $4 = $15.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - $15 = $21

To solve for 'x', we add $15 to both sides of the equation:

x = $21 + $15
x = $36

This means Andrea initially had $36. To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity. 

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as 'x'. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, totaling 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. This represents 30% of the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation 0.3x = 15 to find the total time.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we must calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours, resulting in 20 * $10 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, yielding 15 * $5 = $75. The sum of these earnings is $200 + $75 = $275.

Adding her initial savings of $80 to this total, we get $275 + $80 = $355.

To find the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can start by finding the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree's height can be calculated as 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shortest trees. This is simply the sum of their individual heights: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we can find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees. Therefore, the tallest tree's height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he purchased and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 x 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since she saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

Therefore, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

The final answer is: $0"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have had $8 initially. Since he spent $1.5 on candy, he must have had $8 - $1.5 = $6.5 left.

Since Billy had $6.5 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide $6.5 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. $6.5 / $1.5 = 4.33 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:
S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of days between services, we first need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days, or 0.375 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we must first calculate the amount required for each type of bed.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds. To find the average amount for the collie bed, we take the average of these two values: (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed:

- 4 chihuahua beds require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
- 3 collie beds require 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add these values together: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to break it down into its components.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we consider the detour, which adds 10 miles to the trip. The speed remains 70 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Again, using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Finally, we add up the times for each part of the trip to find the total time taken:

Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we know the total number of students is 96, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

However, we are also given that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. We are given that G = 6 and B = 2G.

Since B = 2G, we can substitute the value of G into the equation to find B:
B = 2 * 6
B = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls:
Total number of kids = B + G
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can set up an equation. Let x be the points scored on the third test. The total points from all three tests must be at least 42. We know that Jane scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. Therefore, we can write the inequality:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Combine the constants on the left side of the inequality:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality to isolate x:

x ≥ 9

Since x represents the points scored on the third test, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we can start by calculating the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for this reason.

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. This can be expressed as 4x - 5.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, which is 3(4x - 5).

We are given that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks: 3
Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4(4) - 5 = 11
Number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale: 3(4x - 5) = 3(4) - 15 = 3

To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, subtract the total number of customers kicked out for specific reasons from the total number of customers kicked out:

50 - 3 - 11 - 3 = 33

Therefore, 33 customers were kicked out for other reasons."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of points Sara had before scoring as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's points before scoring as 3x.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. This is because Sara can't have a fraction of a point.

Sara's points before scoring = 4

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4
Erin's points before = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs:

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884.

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add up the costs:
$884 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To calculate the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to determine the amount of the original cost that is being discounted. 

The discount is 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the total cost for the DIY hand-painted wallpaper.

$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can break down the sales by day and account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50 - 6 = 44

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can break down the information as follows:

Hallie's practice time on Tuesdays is 1 hour. Her practice time on Thursdays is 2 hours. Since her Saturday practice lasts twice as long as Tuesday's class, we can calculate it as 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add up the hours for each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's break it down:

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000 and 160,000 are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

Now, to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we can calculate the cost per piece and multiply it by the number of functioning pieces.

Cost per piece = Total amount spent / Total number of pieces
= $400,000 / 400,000
= $1 per piece

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Cost per piece * Number of functioning pieces
= $1 * 240,000
= $240,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the amount of milk from the first half of the sheep. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them is 30 / 2 = 15. 

The amount of milk from the first half of the sheep is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.

Next, we need to find the amount of milk from the second half of the sheep. Again, half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15. 

The amount of milk from the second half of the sheep is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of rolls remaining after feeding the children. Since Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls and fed 6 to her children, the remaining rolls are 12 - 6 = 6.

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces created from the remaining rolls. Since each roll is broken into 8 pieces, we can multiply the number of remaining rolls by 8. This gives us 6 * 8 = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size. This can be calculated as 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we calculate this as (40 - 20) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can break down the problem into parts.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. This allows us to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The total number of apples picked over the three days is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we must first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing. The total number of socks that need washing is 50. Hence, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

Next, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total: 65 - 44 = 21.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal (initial amount borrowed) = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate (10%/year / 12 months/year) = 0.008333
n = number of payments (5 months)

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 802.03

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the monthly payment Karan has to make is approximately $802.

The final answer is $802."
"To determine the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we can calculate the distance each of them covered.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

The difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe can be found by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To calculate the profit per hour, we first need to determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she buys enough supplies for 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Given that she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, which she spends on supplies.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the total number of female members in the choir. Since 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers also decided to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people performing is the sum of the number of girls (26) and the 3 teachers, which equals 26 + 3 = 29.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 29. This can be calculated as 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14 people who can't make it.

The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The formula for average is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 
400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80."
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we multiply the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil: 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we add the two amounts together: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we can use the concept of fractions. We know that he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. 

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as x. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is 1/3x. 

We are given that the number of messages to Ms. Thompson is 66. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 66

Now, we can find the number of messages to Mr. Yu:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66 = 22

To find the total number of messages, we add the number of messages to both teachers:

Total number of messages = x + 1/3x = 66 + 22 = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, David saves $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

The total number of gifts is the sum of gifts for family, friends, and teachers: 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts: 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the percentage of time spent editing, we must first convert the recording time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs, we must first calculate the capacity of the shelving system. With 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 x 6 = 36 books.

Since Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we need to find double the capacity. This is calculated as 2 x 36 = 72 books.

To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we add 20 more to the doubled capacity: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to consider the initial number of cards she made, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she received 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards."
"To determine the number of slices left, we need to calculate the total slices given away and subtract that from the initial number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total amount / Daily earnings

In this case, the total amount Mark needs is $300, and his daily earnings are $10.

Number of days = $300 / $10
Number of days = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of bugs, we must first calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90
= 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs)
= 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between their ages.

Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given that Erica is 30 years old, so E = 30.

We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so B = E + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35.

Furthermore, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so A = B + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated as A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To calculate the total calories consumed, we can use the formula: Total calories = Number of glasses * Ounces per glass * Calories per ounce.

Given that John drinks 2 glasses of milk, each containing 8 ounces, and milk has 3 calories per ounce, we can plug in the values as follows:

Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3
Total calories = 16 * 3
Total calories = 48

"To calculate the total earnings of the builder for a year, we need to multiply the number of working days in a year by the daily wage.

First, we calculate the total number of working days in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the builder works 6 days a week. So, the total number of working days in a year is 52 * 6 = 312 days.

Next, we multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage, which is $50. Therefore, the total earnings for the year would be 312 * 50 = $15,600.

The final answer is $15,600."
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch.

For flour, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the energy saved, we first need to find the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate. 

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh). 

Now, let's find the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours:
New energy usage per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

The total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate = 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh

Energy saved per day = Original energy usage - New energy usage
= 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh
= 135,000 Wh

To convert Wh to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh

Energy saved in 30 days = 135 kWh * 30 = 4050 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{4050}$"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00"
"To determine the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we must first establish the initial quantities of each. We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. This implies that the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we are informed that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, bringing the total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. However, we must also account for the 40 fewer corns he purchased. Since the ratio of corns to cannolis remains constant, the number of corns can be calculated as 2 * 100 = 200.

Now, we can calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis by adding these quantities together: 200 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we must first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

He completed half of his target 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps completed before his jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4,000}$"
"To determine the time it will take Toby to finish the book, we can calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long, with 200 words per page, resulting in a total of 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Given that Toby can read 300 words per minute, the time required to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Considering Toby needs to arrive at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, we can calculate the time he will arrive early as 60 - 30 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. The total amount paid in May can be calculated as:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, resulting in 3/4 of the original 40 employees remaining. This equates to 30 employees. The company paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June: $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To calculate the total cost of Sally's purchases, we can break down the items and their respective costs.

The taffy is priced at $3 for 2 pounds, with the second pound being 1/2 off. This means the second pound costs $3 - ($3/2) = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is $3."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Tim, we need to find the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the total cost of the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount amount is 0.20 x $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies required for 30 days. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night, the total number of cookies needed is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens. 

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies per dozen = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two sets. We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and we want to find the percentage of these candles that also explode.

Let's denote the total number of candles as 50,000. The number of candles that smell like wet dog is 5% of 50,000, which is 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500.

However, we are not given the percentage of candles that explode. To proceed, we need to make an assumption. Since the problem doesn't provide any other information, we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2500}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can calculate the discount amount and then multiply it by the number of blouses.

First, we find the discount amount for each blouse: 30% of $20 is $6. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Furthermore, we know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 30 = 90 apples from the shortest trees.

We can express the total number of apples gathered by both sisters as the sum of the apples from each category: T + S + A = 500.

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 90 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

120 + A = 500

Subtract 120 from both sides:

A = 380

Therefore, Joanne gathers 380 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, which translates to the equation: c + d = 180.

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304, considering camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write the equation: 2c + d = 304.

Now, we can solve for 'c' and 'd' by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we can break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can start by establishing the relationship between the locker sizes. Let's denote Timothy's locker size as T, Zack's locker size as Z, and Peter's locker size as P.

Given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this as:

P = (1/4)Z

We are also given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

5 = (1/4)Z

To solve for Z, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

4 * 5 = Z
20 = Z

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker:

T = (1/2)Z
T = (1/2) * 20
T = 10

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 10 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the elevation of Stanley and the distance the comb fell. 

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Elevation of Stanley + Distance the comb fell
= 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet
= 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Difference in elevation = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Elevation of Oliver
= 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet
= 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11,000}$"
"To determine the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we can use the concept of addition. 

We know that he initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much, which is $8000. 

To find the total capital, we add the initial amount to the amounts received from the two banks: $5000 + $4000 + $8000.

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried 5 cats each, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Next, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, we find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which equals 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

Therefore, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break it down into three distinct periods.

The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, resulting in a total of $8 * 6 = $48.

The next 8 months are charged at the normal rate of $12 per month, giving a total of $12 * 8 = $96.

The final 8 months are charged at the increased rate of $14 per month, resulting in a total of $14 * 8 = $112.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the original price of the jogger jeans. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6). We can set up the equation:

1/3 * x + 2/3 * (x + 6) = 6

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

We have 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each, which can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees. Additionally, we have 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each, which can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees. Lastly, we have 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each, which can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder as B and the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder as H. We know that H = B + 10.

We are given that there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3B, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3H.

Since H = B + 10, we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3H = 3(B + 10).

Now, we can simplify the equation: 3B + 30 = 3B + 30.

Subtracting 3B from both sides gives us 30 = 30.

This means that the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders is the same. Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see is 3B + 3H = 3B + 3(B + 10) = 3B + 3B + 30 = 6B + 30.

Since we know that 3B = 60 (from the original information), we can substitute this into the equation: 6B + 30 = 6(20) + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the costs of each item.

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost as $4 + 0.25 * $4 = $4 + $1 = $5. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so its cost is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial number of cards as x.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling these cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that Kenny has $50 in spending cash, which is the amount he made from selling the cards. So, we can set up the equation:

1 * x = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 1:

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hotdogs required for 40 guests to have two hotdogs each. Since each guest wants two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs needed as follows:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of hotdogs prepared as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs

The number of hotdogs prepared for these 18 guests is:

18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs

Now, we can find the number of hotdogs left over for the remaining guests:

80 hotdogs (required) - 36 hotdogs (prepared) = 44 hotdogs

Since each of the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18) will have one hotdog, we can calculate the number of hotdogs left over as follows:

44 hotdogs - 22 guests = 22 hotdogs

However, we are interested in the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. Since 22 guests had one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

40 guests - 22 guests = 18 guests

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name (6) is 6 / 2 = 3. 
Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total number of letters in both names.

6 + 7 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the individual costs: $120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount on the total cost. 20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. The cost of the skipping rope is $6, the board game is $11, and the playground ball is $2. 

The total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, totaling $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is $1."
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we can calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew as follows:

3/4 * 100 = 75

Next, we are told that Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew:

2 * 75 = 150

Finally, we are informed that Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can calculate:

1/5 * 150 = 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can start by dividing the total amount of gas (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5). This gives us 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the amount per container by 1/4. 

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

To convert gallons to pints, we know that there are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply 3/4 gallon by 8 pints/gallon.

(3/4) * 8 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

We also know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents and George bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can use the concept of division. 

We start by subtracting the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had: 25 - 5 = 20. This gives us the total number of lollipops to be shared among his four friends.

Next, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we can use the concept of division and subtraction. 

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total number of pieces they had is 2. We know that the cake was cut into 8 pieces in total. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the 2 pieces that were taken from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces taken = 2

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The correct answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we must first calculate the total number of people involved. This can be done by adding the number of individuals Sitti and Juris are sharing with, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) plus their 6 friends, resulting in a total of 8 people.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. The total number of oranges is the sum of Sitti's and Juris's oranges, which is 34 + 22 = 56.

Now, we perform the division: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00. Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

The final answer is $2."
"To determine the time difference in their departure, we first need to establish the time it takes for each individual to reach the theater.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to reach the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater as B. We know that B = 4W, as the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.

We are also given that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to reach the theater. Therefore, W = 4.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater: B = 4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. Therefore, the time difference in their departure is 4 - 5 = 1 minute.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we must first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Next, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width: Area = Length * Width. Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has a total of 1 + 2 * 20 = 41 beads.

Margareth purchased 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has a total of 3 + 4 * 20 = 83 beads.

To find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 83 - 41 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the combined effects of the temperature increase due to baking and the subsequent cooling effect.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. Every hour that the oven is on, the temperature increases by 5 degrees. Since the oven is on for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

However, the house cools down at a rate of 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The window is open for 30 minutes, resulting in a cooling effect of 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase: 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

Let's denote James' swim time as S, bike time as B, and run time as R. We know that James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so S = 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes. We also know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so B = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + R - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + R

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = R

Therefore, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we must first convert the length of Movie C to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. We are given the speed (32 miles per hour) and the time (30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, and each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, each tray can hold 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

To find the number of trays Rozanne can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 50 ÷ 25 = 2.

The correct answer is 2."
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we must calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score after their respective turns.

Joey initially had 214 points. He then scored 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy, who had 225 points, scored 10 points, increasing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

The difference between their scores is 240 - 235 = 5 points.

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points.

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to consider the revenue generated from both the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale: 17 sneakers were sold at $20 each, resulting in a revenue of 17 * $20 = $340.

Next, we need to find the revenue from the remaining sneakers sold to the department store. The total number of sneakers is 48, and 17 were sold at the flash sale, so the number of sneakers left is 48 - 17 = 31. These sneakers were sold at $25 each, resulting in a revenue of 31 * $25 = $775.

Now, we can calculate the total revenue by adding the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the total number of colors in the six packets with 8 colors each. This can be done by multiplying the number of packets (6) by the number of colors in each packet (8), resulting in 6 x 8 = 48 colors.

Next, we calculate the total number of colors in the four packets with 16 colors each. This can be done by multiplying the number of packets (4) by the number of colors in each packet (16), resulting in 4 x 16 = 64 colors.

To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is 112."
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2 by not buying it. This means the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

We are also given that the cost of the movie ticket is $12. Therefore, the cost of the popcorn can be found by subtracting the cost of the movie ticket from the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket: $17 - $12 = $5.

The cost of the soda is $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $5."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the new cost of filling one balloon. Since the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can divide $900 by 20 to get the cost of filling one balloon. 

$900 ÷ 20 = $45

Now, we know that the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase is $45 + $20 = $65.

Next, we can multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170 to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons.

$65 × 170 = $11,050

Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To calculate the average speed of the car, we must first determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering an additional 30 miles. The total distance is therefore 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she has left after the trade. She initially had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she now possesses 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires can be calculated by multiplying the number of sapphires by their individual value: 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we must calculate the value of the rubies she received. Since she acquired 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200, the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

Since both Marin and Nancy consume 4 apples per day, we can calculate the total number of apples eaten by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days. 

The calculation is as follows: 4 apples/day * 30 days = 120 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will eat a total of 120 apples in 30 days.

"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we must first calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the raised bed) is found by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the volume of one bed is 8 feet (length) x 2 feet (width) x 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find this by multiplying the number of red cards by 1.6.

Number of green cards = 15 * 1.6 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we must first calculate the total number of puppies. This can be achieved by adding the number of puppies from Jennifer's dog (8) to the number of puppies from Brandon's dog (12).

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we must calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, the weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds, and the weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. 

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck, which is 2250 pounds.

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To calculate Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to determine her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then combine them.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans a week, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. Each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles a week, so her weekly earnings from plastic bottles is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find her monthly earnings, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can start by finding the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Let's denote Frederick's plants as F and Toni's plants as T. We know that F = 10. We can express the relationship between F and T as:

T = F + 0.6F
T = 1.6F
T = 1.6 * 10
T = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student received.

Miss Maria has a total of 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, which equals 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. Additionally, she has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, totaling 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. Combining these, we get a total of 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards. Each student received 10 cards, so we can find the number of students by dividing the remaining cards by 10: 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples each of them bought and subtract the discount from each total.

Becky's total cost is 20 apples * 0.45 dollars/apple = 9 dollars. After receiving a 1-dollar discount, Becky paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Kelly's total cost is 20 apples * 0.50 dollars/apple = 10 dollars. After receiving a 10% discount, Kelly paid 10 - (10% of 10) dollars. To find 10% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.10, which equals 1 dollar. Therefore, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount: 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Let's break it down:

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the total number of pieces per room by 80:
15 * 80 = 1200

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 10 individual shoes (since each pair consists of 2 shoes). So, he now has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 30 individual shoes. Adding these to his existing collection, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 more pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 60 individual shoes. Adding these to his collection, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.
5. Finally, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the number of shoes he has left, we subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles."
"To determine the cost of the piece of paper, we can use the given information. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, we can calculate the cost of the paper as follows:

Three times the price of the pen is 2 * 3 = $6.
The piece of paper costs $1 less than this amount, so it costs 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the pen and the cost of the paper, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

To find the amount of change Theo received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave the cashier: 10 - 7 = $3.

"To determine the number of pencils left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we find the number of pencils used in two months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Then, we calculate the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we find the number of pencils left at the end of the year: 1/3 of 240 pencils = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as x. According to the problem, Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To isolate x, we can first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to calculate the combined length of the remoras in feet and then divide it by the shark's body length.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet: 6 inches = 0.5 feet. Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's body length: 1 foot / 10 feet = 0.1.

To find the percentage, multiply by 100: 0.1 * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of students as x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

Equating (1/4)x to 20, we get:

(1/4)x = 20

Multiplying both sides by 4 to isolate x, we get:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."

We know that the total amount spent on books is $300, and the cost of each book is $15. 

First, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child received:

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both, as they were counted twice: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

The final answer is 607."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to break down the expenses into two components: the plane tickets and the hotel.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Adding this to the normal price, we get $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we can find the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we can break down the information into two parts: blue paint and yellow paint.

Let's start with the blue paint. We know that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we can calculate Jasper's blue paint as follows:

Jasper's blue paint = Ben's blue paint / 2
Jasper's blue paint = 4 / 2
Jasper's blue paint = 2

Next, we'll calculate the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. We know that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we can calculate Jasper's yellow paint as follows:

Jasper's yellow paint = 3 * Ben's yellow paint
Jasper's yellow paint = 3 * 3
Jasper's yellow paint = 9

Now, we can find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has by adding the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint:

Total paint = Jasper's blue paint + Jasper's yellow paint
Total paint = 2 + 9
Total paint = 11

Therefore, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as x. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can write the equation:

x = (3/4) * 48

To solve for x, we can multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4:

x = (3 * 48) / 4
x = 144 / 4
x = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = weight of 1959 penny + weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we can calculate the total earnings of Keegan and Tashay. 

Let's add their individual earnings: $83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tashay) = $174.

Therefore, they need $26 more to reach their goal."
"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate 3 times the number of songs Gabriel has. 

Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Since the maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs, we can find out how many songs Gabriel can add by subtracting the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity. 

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, Luri can add 20 fewer songs than Gabriel can add to his player."
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 

First, we'll multiply 2/5 by 60. To do this, we'll multiply the numerator (2) by 60, then divide the result by 5.

(2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we'll multiply 24 by 10 to find the total amount of money he gave up.

24 * 10 = $240

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We are given that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are also given that her shoes cost $80. Substituting s = $80 into the equation, we get:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"To determine the total hours James runs per week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we multiply the number of miles he runs per day (12 miles) by the number of days he runs per week (5 days). This yields a total of 60 miles per week.

Next, we divide the total miles per week (60 miles) by the miles per hour (10 miles). This calculation results in 6 hours per week.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours per week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we must first calculate the total daily consumption of oats. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many 50-pound bags are required to meet this total. We can do this by dividing the total amount of oats needed by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can use the concept of fractions. We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls.

Let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Fraction of Pomeranians = 2/3
Number of Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27 = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the number of girl Pomeranians by taking one-third of this total:

Fraction of girl Pomeranians = 1/3
Number of girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18 = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To calculate the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. 

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, we divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is -10."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we can use a simple division operation.

The child needs to save $8 more to buy the toy, and he saves $2 daily from his allowance. 

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, the child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we can use simple subtraction. 

First, we need to find the total capacity of the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, the total capacity is 2 * 24 = 48 eggs.

Next, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza by multiplying the cost of the small pizza by 3.

The cost of the small pizza is $8. Therefore, the cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times this amount, which is $8 * 3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total cost. 

$8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors.

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. 

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, and since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, we can assume the average height of these girls is 64"". Therefore, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and again, we assume an average height of 64"" for these girls. So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, with an average height of 64"" for these girls. Thus, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall and is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we need to calculate the total minutes she walks per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since Charisma works 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes she works per day is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

She also walks for 5 minutes every hour, so the total minutes she walks per day is 5 * 8 = 40 minutes.

To find the total minutes she has walked after 5 days, we multiply the minutes she walks per day by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes after 5 days at the office."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. According to the problem, in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is 14 years old now, we can set up the equation:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Now, we can solve for A by subtracting 4 from both sides:

A = 42 - 4
A = 38

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is 38."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we can use the concept of daily and total costs.

Let's break it down:

- The cost of morning rides is $6 per ride, and he drives twice a day, so the daily cost of morning rides is 2 * $6 = $12.
- The cost of afternoon rides is $2 per ride, and he drives twice a day, so the daily cost of afternoon rides is 2 * $2 = $4.
- The total daily cost of driving is $12 (morning rides) + $4 (afternoon rides) = $16.
- Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, the total cost is 2 * $16 * 14 = $448.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $448 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"To determine the total number of oranges, we can calculate the sum of the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, resulting in 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the total number of pies by dividing the total number of oranges by 3. This gives us 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 greek orange pies."
"To determine the break-even point for the two venues, we can set up an equation based on the costs associated with each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, which can be expressed as 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which can be expressed as 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 results in:

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we can add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is equivalent to 91 yards (since 1/4 * 364 = 91). Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to 182 yards (since 1/2 * 364 = 182).

The total yards used is the sum of these two amounts: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{273}$"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each. This can be represented as 2 x 5, which equals 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each. This can be represented as 3 x 2, which equals 6 gifts.

Now, we add the gifts from both groups together: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 additional random gifts to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the length of the couch, we can start by finding the width of the rug. Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, the total spent on these two types of gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Given that Suzie paid a total of $7, the amount spent on strawberry gum can be found by subtracting the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie purchased 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack can be determined by dividing the total spent on strawberry gum by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option. We can calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For 2 x 8 lumber, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, we can conclude that the 2 x 8 lumber is the most cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make with $24. We can divide the available budget by the cost per stick of the 2 x 8 lumber:

$24 ÷ $6 = 4

Since Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber, we can calculate the total number of sticks:

4 x 400 = 1600

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To calculate the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Dogs * Cost per Pair of Snowshoes

Given that each dog has 4 legs and each pair of snowshoes is $12.00, we can proceed with the calculation.

Total Cost = 6 * $12.00
Total Cost = $72.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To determine the weekly savings of Janet by purchasing a bus pass, we must first calculate the total weekly cost of her bus trips. 

Since Janet takes two bus trips per day, 5 days a week, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10. 

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, her weekly savings would be $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we can start by establishing the number of cows and sheep in each location.

Let's denote the number of cows in the farm as F and the number of sheep in the zoo as Z. We are given the following information:

1. The farm has 30 cows, so F = 30.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so Z = 2F.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so F = Z/2.

We can use the first equation to find the value of Z. Since F = 30, we can substitute this into the second equation to get Z = 2(30) = 60.

Now, we can find the number of sheep in the farm by substituting Z into the third equation: F = Z/2 = 60/2 = 30.

Now, we can add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 30 sheep = 60 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is 140."
"To determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as x and the number of potatoes as y. According to the given information, we can set up the following equations:

x + y = 12 (onions)
4x + 4y = 48 (since Rose bought 4 times the number of each)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 4:

x + y = 12
x + y = 12

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:

(x + y) - (x + y) = 12 - 12
0 = 0

This means that the two equations are identical, and we can't find a unique solution for x and y. However, we can express y in terms of x from the first equation:

y = 12 - x

Since we know that Sophia bought 3 onions, we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

y = 12 - 3
y = 9

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 9 potatoes.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 9 = 12."
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds in 7 months, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve this goal.

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories per pound. To lose 30 pounds, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his goal."
"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we can calculate his total earnings and subtract the amount spent. 

Gerald's daily wage is $30, and he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as 7 * $30 = $210.

Next, we subtract the amount spent from his total earnings: $210 - $100 = $110.

Gerald's remaining balance is $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance can be found by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we know that Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer. To find the total amount of water she needs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water needed per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 * 60
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate 20% of the initial $500, which represents the amount spent on clothes. This can be found by multiplying 0.20 by $500, resulting in $100.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Then, we calculate 25% of the remaining $400, which is the amount spent on CDs. This can be found by multiplying 0.25 by $400, resulting in $100.

Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the cost of the house, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the house as 'H' and the cost of the lot as 'L'. We know that the total cost is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

H + L = 120,000

We are also given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express this as:

H = 3L

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

3L + L = 120,000
4L = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:

L = 120,000 / 4
L = 30,000

Since H = 3L, we can now find the cost of the house:

H = 3 * 30,000
H = 90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000."
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara, we need to consider the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost of the bags can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 8 packs * $4 per pack = $32.

The total revenue is obtained by multiplying the number of bags by the selling price per bag: 8 bags * $8 per bag = $64.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $64 - $32 = $32.

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $32."
"To calculate the total number of punches Joe threw, we can multiply the number of punches he throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight. 

First, we multiply the number of punches per minute (25) by the number of minutes in a round (3), which gives us 25 * 3 = 75 punches per round. 

Since the fight consists of 5 rounds, we then multiply the number of punches per round (75) by the number of rounds (5), resulting in 75 * 5 = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches during the fight.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the number of cookies each person made. Let's denote the number of cookies Suzanne made as S, Josh's cookies as J, and Kelsie's cookies as K.

We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so we can express this as:

J = S/4

We are also given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

J = 36/4
J = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find the number of cookies Kelsie made, which is two times more than Josh's:

K = 2J
K = 2(9)
K = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. 
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48. 
The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we must first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can calculate this as follows:

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. To find the time it takes Royce, we can calculate:

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes."
"To calculate the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we must first determine the total number of items for the triplets. Since there are three grandchildren, and each child requires a hat, scarf, sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of socks, we can calculate the total number of items as follows:

- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we can calculate the total number of skeins needed by multiplying the number of items by the corresponding number of skeins required for each item:

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 6 skeins

T = 6
B = T - 1
K = 2B
R = K - 2

We can substitute the values of B and K in terms of T into the equations for K and R:

B = 6 - 1 = 5
K = 2(5) = 10
R = 10 - 2 = 8

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
T + B + K + R = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

First, we calculate the original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. Then, we multiply this by the cost per kilowatt-hour, which is $1.50, to find the original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

Next, we calculate the new weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. We then multiply this by the number of days in a week, 7, to find the new weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours. Finally, we multiply the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour to find the new weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can start by finding the rate at which one person paints a house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

To find the rate at which one person paints a whole house, we multiply the rate by 2:

Rate = (1/5 house per day) * 2 = 2/5 house per day

Now, we can find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house by dividing 1 house by the combined rate of 5 people:

Time = 1 house / (5 * (2/5) house per day) = 1 / 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours:

Time = 1 / 2 days * 24 hours/day = 12 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 12 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This can be represented as:

Number of sofas = Number of chairs - 2
20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
Jenna's chairs = 3x
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the headphone set.

The total amount paid is $48, and the cost of the headphone set is $44. 

The remaining amount is $48 - $44 = $4. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought:

$4 ÷ $4 = 1

Therefore, Tom could have bought 1 more CD if he had not purchased the headphone set.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours. Since there are 5 weeks with 4 hours, we multiply 4 hours by 5 weeks: 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours.

Next, we add the hours from the week he worked 5 hours: 20 hours + 5 hours = 25 hours.

Then, we add the hours from the week he worked 6 hours: 25 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 31 hours.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers now is 59 + 63 = 122.

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 122."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Jame's current age as x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 21 years old. 

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost to find the combined cost of the monitors. The total cost is $2,400, so:

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the combined cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can start by calculating the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 600 + 4 * 60. 

Simplifying the expression, we get 600 + 240 = 840. 

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find Nick's initial amount by substituting G into the first equation:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially."
"To determine Anne's age, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote Chenny's age as C, Alyana's age as A, and Anne's age as N.

We know that Chenny is 10 years old, so C = 10.

We also know that Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so A = C - 4.

Substituting C = 10 into the equation, we get A = 10 - 4 = 6.

Finally, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so N = A + 2.

Substituting A = 6 into the equation, we get N = 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can calculate the difference between the total number of vlogs she wants to make and the number of vlogs she has already made.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is 18."
"To calculate the total amount paid, we need to find 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 can be calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Let's denote the initial amount each boy received as x. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can set up the equation:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

Now, the eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

To triple the amount he had left after spending $8, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 15 days in the second half of April, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half of the month. We know that the total amount saved in the first half of the month is equal to the total amount saved in the second half of the month, so we can set up the equation:

x * 15 = 2x * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = $1125 / 15
x = $75

Since Elvis saves $75 per day in the first half of the month, he will save 2x = $150 per day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $150"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of fruit by its respective price and then add the results together.

The cost of apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, his total earnings are 20 * $0.8 = $16.
Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, her total earnings are 20 * $0.5 = $10.

The difference in their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount of money is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

Since Jeff's share is 4x, we can calculate his share as:

4x = 4 * 20
= 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the daily distance and multiply it by the number of working days.

The distance from Jeff's home to work is 3 miles, and since he walks to and from work, the daily distance is 2 times the one-way distance. 

Daily distance = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into three distinct steps.

First, we calculate the number of letters written in the initial full alphabet repetitions: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, we consider the half-alphabet written once, which consists of 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters.

Lastly, we account for the re-write of the previously written content, which encompasses the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters, totaling 65 letters.

Combining these values, we obtain the total number of letters written: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To calculate the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. The total number of families notified now is 3 + 9 = 12.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. The total number of families notified now is 12 + 27 = 39.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified. The total number of families notified now is 39 + 81 = 120.

Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use the concept of subtraction. We know that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. 

Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. 

We can set up the equation: x - 30 = 70 (since his final weight is 70 pounds)

To solve for 'x', we add 30 to both sides of the equation: x = 70 + 30
x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to calculate the number of toys required for a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys."
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first find the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks can be calculated as 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $20, which is 0.1 * $20 = $2.
The discount amount is $2, so the total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

The total cost of the items: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill:
$50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, Carly gets $17 back as change."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

First, we calculate the commission for sales up to $1000: 30% of $1000 is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

Next, we calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000. Since the sales exceed $1000 by $1500, we calculate 10% of $1500: 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Finally, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings: $300 + $150 = $450.

The final answer is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles he already possesses. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, we can find this total by multiplying the number of cases by the number of bottles per case: 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles for each guest, so we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest: 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles Bill needs to purchase, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we first need to establish the time it takes to swim 3 miles in each scenario.

Let's denote the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day as 'x'. Since Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, we can set up the equation:
x = 16

Now, we're told that on a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. This translates to:
2x + 2

To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3(2x + 2)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6x + 6

Now, we can substitute the value of x (16) into the equation:
6(16) + 6
96 + 6
102

To find the time difference, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48
54

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings: $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40):

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we multiply $40 by 3.

$40 * 3 = $120

The total cost for both subs is the sum of their individual costs.

$40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the total cost for lunch is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes. Since there are 7 such buttons, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes. There are 14 such buttons (21 total buttons minus the 7 with two holes), so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can start by finding the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker. Since Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Next, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4:

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size / 4
Peter's locker size = 12 / 4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups. 

Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current intake is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of rodents, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

We have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30. 

We also have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45.

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. The sun initially moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. 

We can calculate the total angle the sun has moved upward by multiplying the hourly rate (5 degrees) by the number of hours (10). This yields a total angle of 50 degrees.

The initial angle of the sun at the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. To find the final angle, we add the total angle the sun has moved upward (50 degrees) to the initial angle (32 degrees). This results in a final angle of 82 degrees from the ground to the sun.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required. 

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Since James has two sons, he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, making a total of 4 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the total cost by dividing the total number of candles needed by 5 and then multiplying by the cost per pack.

4 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.8 packs

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

1 pack of 5 candles costs $3.

Therefore, James spends $3 on birthday candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of pages she read in the first week and the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to find out how many minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can calculate the total minutes she read in the first week as follows:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find the number of pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes by 1.5 and multiply by 2:

105 minutes / 1.5 = 70 pages

Now that we know she read 70 pages in the first week, we can add this to the 100 pages she read in the second week to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks:

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can calculate the total portion eaten by Cody and Trevor. 

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 3 sandwiches. 

The total portion eaten is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total portion eaten from the initial total. 

12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be represented by the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we have a fixed amount of $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals. We can use this information to solve for Mark's and Anna's goals.

First, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation: 
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Next, we can substitute R = 80 into the second equation:
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate the total amount each of them made by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price of each lemonade.

Let's denote the number of lemonades sold by Liam as L and the price of each lemonade as P. We know that Liam made $63, so we can set up the equation:

L * P = 63

We also know that Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we can calculate his total earnings as:

21 * 4 = 84

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

Difference = 84 - 63
= 21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the total amount spent on wooden and plastic action figures separately.

Peter spent $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, for a total of 3 days. This amounts to:
$5 * 3 = $15

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
- 3 wooden action figures
- 27 plastic action figures

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4:

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied in a month: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses supplied to the shops:

260 (total roses supplied) - 160 (total roses grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Initial Amount = $3000
Monthly Withdrawal = $100
Number of Months = 24

First, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn in 2 years:
Total Withdrawal = Monthly Withdrawal * Number of Months
Total Withdrawal = $100 * 24
Total Withdrawal = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Withdrawal
Remaining Amount = $3000 - $2400
Remaining Amount = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The number of sandwiches sold is 10, and the price per sandwich is $7.00. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated as:

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost of bread per loaf is $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:

Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Additionally, the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to consider the costs associated with the carpet, padding, and installation.

First, we calculate the area of the room: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet in Michael's bedroom is $9608."
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to sum up the total number of birds he observed over the 7 days and then divide by 7.

Let's break down the data:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps:

1. The starting value is 20.
2. This value plus half the number was divided by 5: (20 + (20/2)) / 5
   First, calculate half of 20: 20/2 = 10
   Then, add 10 to 20: 20 + 10 = 30
   Finally, divide 30 by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12)
   First, subtract 12 from 20: 20 - 12 = 8
   Then, multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we can simply add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. This means the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 18 degrees off from the set temperature. To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of the target temperature. 

4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

To find the correct temperature, we add the error to the target temperature: 
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

Final answer: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3.

0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

To find the combined value of both houses, we add their individual values.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils, we must first calculate the number of cups and dishes each individual brought.

Judy initially purchased a dozen cups, which equates to 12 cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we must first calculate the discounted price of 2 boxes. The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 

First, we calculate 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00. Subtracting this from the original price yields a discounted price of $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box.

Since Pete is purchasing 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs. 

Therefore, the cost of each pair of contacts is $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Therefore, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His hourly wage is also $10, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

The total calories burned from aerobics and running can be calculated as follows:

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

As a result, Hannah needs 8 times the amount of water for 200 calories. To find the total amount of water needed, we multiply 8 by 100 ml.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over 5 weeks.

Let's denote the weight change per week for Cheerios as -1.25 pounds and for donuts as 1.75 pounds. 

The total weight change for Cheerios over 5 weeks is -1.25 * 5 = -6.25 pounds.

The total weight change for donuts over 5 weeks is 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can employ a systematic approach. 

First, we consider the initial number of people invited by Alex, which is 100. Each of these individuals will, in turn, invite 2 friends, resulting in an additional 200 people. Furthermore, Alex directly invites 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding 18 more individuals to the count.

To calculate the total number of attendees, we sum the initial number of people invited, the number of friends invited, and the number of friends' spouses: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

The final answer is: $\boxed{318}$"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can break down the information step by step.

First, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Lastly, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk on each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 × 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 × 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 × 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily amount of protein and then multiply it by 7.

First, we know that each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can find the number of cups he eats per day by dividing 200 grams by 100 grams per cup:

200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day

Next, we multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup to find the daily amount of protein:

2 cups per day * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams per day

To find the weekly amount of protein, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we must first calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, we'll calculate the value of each type of coin: 
- 8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2
- 6 dimes = 6 x $0.10 = $0.60
- 14 nickels = 14 x $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 x $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet. Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs. Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs. Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, we'll add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we first calculate the weight he initially increased by 50%. This is done by finding 50% of the original weight, which is 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Then, we add this increase to the original weight to find the new weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds to find the final weight.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, Jamaal now uses 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down the problem into three parts: the number of games he receives as gifts and the number of games he purchases.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games per month for 12 months, totaling 12 * 1 = 12 games. Adding the birthday gift, he has 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games per month for 12 months, totaling 12 * 1 = 12 games. Adding the birthday gift, he has 5 + 12 = 17 games. He also receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 2 games per month for 12 months, totaling 12 * 2 = 24 games. Adding the birthday gift, he has 5 + 24 = 29 games. He also receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the number of games from each year: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can utilize the concept of rate and time. 

First, we calculate the rate at which the plane travels. This is achieved by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Next, we can use this rate to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles. We divide the additional distance (2000 miles) by the rate (400 miles per hour).

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to first determine the individual rates at which they produce chocolates.

Ruiz's rate is given as 120 pounds in 2 hours, which translates to 60 pounds per hour. 

Marissa's rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate, so we can calculate it as follows: (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz's production: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's production: 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

The final answer is $12."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. This can be calculated as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. This can be calculated as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

The total earnings can be found by adding the earnings from both periods:

$30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine the number of years a tire will last, we must first calculate the total number of rotations it can undergo. Given that each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times and it rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the total miles driven per rotation as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles/rotation = 362.5 miles/rotation

Now, we can multiply the total miles driven per year by the number of rotations per year to find the total miles driven per year:

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Divide the total miles driven per year by the miles driven per rotation to find the number of rotations per year:

4800 miles/year / 362.5 miles/rotation = 13.22 rotations/year

Finally, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 13.22 rotations/year = 790.5 years

The tire will last approximately 790.5 years before it needs to be replaced.

Final answer: 790.5"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can start by finding the cost per 120 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Since 1 pump provides 60 washings, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per 60 washings by 60.

Cost per pump = $12.00 / 60
Cost per pump = 0.20

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump = 0.20 * 100
Cost per pump = 20 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we first need to find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the shirt's original price. 

The discount on the shirt is $25 * 0.3 = $7.50. 

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), the sales tax is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70.

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money, this means he will not have enough money to buy the outfit."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days. 

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

4 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

To find the total amount of butter needed for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Lewis' and Monica's streets, we can calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost per meter is $194, and Monica's street is 150 meters long. To find the total cost of repaving her street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of her street:

Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost for Monica's street = $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long:

Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost for Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, we find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

Therefore, repaving Lewis' street costs $65,960 more than repaving Monica's street."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the number of days in the month. March has 31 days.

The total number of posts per day is given as 3. To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to determine the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we multiply the number of weeks in a year (52) by the frequency of laundry (2):

52 weeks/year * 2 loads/week = 104 loads/year

Next, we calculate the total gallons of water used per year by multiplying the number of loads by the gallons of water per load (20 gallons):

104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Now, we can find the total cost of water for laundry in a year by multiplying the total gallons of water used by the cost per gallon ($0.15):

2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total amount spent by Scarlett, we need to consider the costs of each item she purchased.

The aquarium costs $10.00. Two bags of rocks, priced at $2.50 each, amount to 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Three pieces of coral, priced at $2.00 each, amount to 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. Additionally, Scarlett bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, resulting in 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Lastly, she spent $2.00 on fish food.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

The total amount spent by Scarlett is $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can break down the growth pattern as follows:

The initial height is 3 inches. In the second week, the height doubles, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the third week, the height increases by 4 inches, giving us a total of 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can use a simple division problem. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells per day is 15 * 10 = 150kg.

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find the number of days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg per day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first calculate the total number of seats. With 4 rows of seats, each containing 18 seats, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats: 72 * 1/4 = 18.

The remaining seats after administrators are seated are 72 - 18 = 54.

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats: 54 * 1/3 = 18.

Finally, to find the number of seats occupied by students, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats: 54 - 18 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 students in the school auditorium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights can be found by multiplying the number of poles per intersection by the number of street lights per pole: 6 poles/intersection * 4 street lights/pole = 24 street lights.

However, we are informed that 20 of these street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total: 24 total street lights - 20 non-functioning street lights = 4 functioning street lights.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played and subtract that from the total capacity of each DVD.

Let's calculate the remaining capacity of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times left
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times left

Now, we add the remaining capacities of both DVDs to find the total number of times they can be played:
644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to multiply the number of hours attended by the cost per hour. 

Since John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions. Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours. The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * $125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so we add 2 more pieces to the total:

4 pieces (at school) + 2 pieces (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, we know Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces

Finally, when he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away:

14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we can calculate it by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

Now, to find her age 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the difference in spending between the two coaches, we can calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach acquired 8 basketballs at $14 each, leading to a total expenditure of 8 * 14 = $112.

The difference in spending between the two coaches can be found by subtracting the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers, we can calculate the fraction of flowers that have bloomed and multiply it by the total number of flowers in the garden.

The fraction of bloomed flowers is 4/5, and the total number of flowers is 200. 

We can multiply these two values to find the number of bloomed flowers:
(4/5) * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per hour, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we establish the conversion factor between kb and Mb: 1 Mb = 1000 kb. 

Now, we convert Ashley's speed from kb per second to Mb per second by dividing by 1000:
20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply her speed by 60 to get the speed in Mb per hour:
0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining days.

Let's start by calculating the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days to get the total:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Since there are 4 remaining days, we can multiply this rate by the number of days to get the total:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, his height after 'y' years can be represented as 40 + 2y.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 + 2y = 48

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2y = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The total cost of the cars is $250,000, and the company paid 30% of that amount. This equates to 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is then calculated by subtracting the amount paid by the company from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James receives a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James' total earnings are $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find 25% of the total number of riders, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which equals 15. 

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as D, the price of a gold jewel as G, and the price of a silver jewel as S. We are given that D = $2000.

We are also given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, so we can express this as:

G = (4/5)D
G = (4/5)($2000)
G = $1600

Additionally, the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can express this as:

S = G - $400
S = $1600 - $400
S = $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16 (given information). We also know that T = S + 3 (he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps) and R = T - 9 (he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps).

Substituting S = 16 into the equation T = S + 3, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting T = 19 into the equation R = T - 9, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp together: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We are also given that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Additionally, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum amount they are willing to pay per class.

Let's denote the total number of classes as 'x'. The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. We can set up the equation:

10x ≤ 60

To find the maximum number of classes, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x ≤ 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find the number of classes he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. This can be calculated as:

10 - 6 = 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total weekly production, we must first establish the daily production of each individual. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The combined daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week: 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x'. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie's distance can be expressed as 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We are also given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This can be represented as an equation: 20 = x + 3. To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

20 - 3 = x
x = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can use the given prices to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, we'll find the cost of 5 apples. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can multiply the cost of 4 apples by 1.25 (5/4) to get the cost of 5 apples: $5.20 * 1.25 = $6.50.

Next, we'll find the cost of 5 oranges. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 1.67 (5/3) to get the cost of 5 oranges: $3.30 * 1.67 = $5.51.

Now, we'll add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together: $6.50 + $5.51 = $12.01.

The final answer is: $12.01"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time:

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Final answer: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and the bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current monthly salary of $20,000. This can be calculated as 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find Tim's yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: $31,000 x 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into individual components and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500.

Next, we determine the cost of the dress pants, which is 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost $750 * (1/5) = $150.

The cost of the dress shirts is $60 each, and James buys 3 shirts per suit. So, the total cost of the dress shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts per suit * $60 per shirt = $1,800.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

The total cost of everything is $10,800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites, we need to find the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. To find the total number of articles published by the news website, we multiply the number of articles per day by the number of days in February:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. To find the total number of articles published by the sister company, we multiply the number of articles per day by the number of days in February:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information into a series of equations based on the given relationships.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as T, and his son's wife's age as TS.

From the information provided, we have the following equations:

1. S = 60 (Steve's age)
2. W = S + 4 (Steve's wife is 4 years older than him)
3. T = W / 2 (Their son is half as old as his mom)
4. TS = T - 3 (Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband)

We can start by finding Steve's wife's age using equation (2):
W = S + 4
W = 60 + 4
W = 64

Next, we can find their son's age using equation (3):
T = W / 2
T = 64 / 2
T = 32

Finally, we can find their son's wife's age using equation (4):
TS = T - 3
TS = 32 - 3
TS = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups: Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

First, we'll calculate the number of cupcakes for each group. Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor for everyone, he needs 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates.

For the 25 classmates, we multiply the number of classmates by the number of cupcakes per classmate: 25 * 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we add the number of cupcakes for each group: 2 (for Howie) + 2 (for the teacher) + 50 (for the classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is 54."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This can be expressed as:

x + 20000 = 70x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:

20000 = 69x

Next, we divide both sides by 69:

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.52

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll keep the exact value for accuracy.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes:

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 288.52 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.52

The final answer is 20128.52."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 off = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 - $540 = -$142.

The correct answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can break down the problem into two parts.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats in the first month were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can express the sales from red hats as G/2.

We know that the total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is G + G/2. We are given that this total is $1200. So, we can set up the equation:

G + G/2 = 1200

To solve for G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2G + G = 2400

Combine like terms:

3G = 2400

Divide both sides by 3:

G = 800

Now that we know the sales from green hats in the first month, we can find the sales from red hats:

G/2 = 800/2 = 400

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 x $1200 = $900.

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the carriage rental, we need to consider the time period and the hourly rates. 

The carriage was rented from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, James received 1 hour of free time. Therefore, the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first hour and the cost of the remaining hours, which is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's denote Sally's weekly wage as W and the amount withheld as x. We know that her bank account balance at the start of the week was $200, and it now holds $420. We can set up the equation:

W - x = 420 - 200
W - x = 220

We also know that Sally's weekly wage should be $300. So, we can set up another equation:

W = 300

Now, we can substitute W = 300 into the first equation:

300 - x = 220

To solve for x, we can subtract 300 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 220 - 300
-x = -80

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:

x = 80

Therefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs required for the party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will consume.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each deviled egg half requires one whole egg, we must divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12.

Total dozens needed: 24 / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for the party."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the remaining fraction by subtracting 1/3 from 1 (the whole paper). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3 in this case. 

1 can be written as 3/3. Now, we can subtract:

3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3

This means Shiela has 2/3 of the paper left to write. To find the number of pages, we can multiply the fraction by the total number of pages:

(2/3) * 15 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day

Given that the total number of pages is 200 and the number of pages per day is 10, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

Number of days = 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline:

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is 10."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price and the first year's costs: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can break down the information into steps.

First, we know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then find the difference.

Let's start by finding the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is 1/2 * $10 = $5. 
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. 
The total cost of this mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 
The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is 1/5 * $10 = $2. 
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. 
The total cost of this mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we'll find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. 
The difference in cost is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.
The total number of animal heads can be represented as s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Now that we have found 's', we can find 'g' by substituting 's' into the equation g = 20 - s:
g = 20 - 15
g = 5

Therefore, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, which costs $5 per pound. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Next, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased. 

The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Adding the cost of a bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and a bottle of soda ($1.00), we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can find the cost of the apple pie by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. 

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We know that the total number of newspapers delivered is 600, and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C combined is 198 + 209 = 407.

Using the equation:

Total newspapers delivered = Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District B + Newspapers delivered to District C
600 = 198 + x + 209

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting the known values from both sides of the equation:

x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we must first calculate the total class time. 

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe, which is 1.5 hours. 

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 32 recipes

The final answer is 32."
"To find the number of math teachers, we can calculate 100% of the total number of teachers, as the remaining percentage represents the math teachers.

Number of math teachers = 100% - 60%
= 100% - 60%
= 40%

Now, we can find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day by multiplying the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 40% * 6 hours
= 0.4 * 6
= 2.4 hours

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 2.4 hours."
"To determine the amount of money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we need to calculate the total amount of money they have and then divide it by 3.

Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna's amount is 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total length of the game, we can calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

The total time of the 4 regular quarters is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes. Adding the extra 5 minutes, we get 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees. 

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Next, find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we can calculate the amount of each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

For flour, we multiply the amount per muffin (5 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons.

For sugar, we multiply the amount per muffin (3 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons.

For salt, we multiply the amount per muffin (0.25 tablespoons) by the number of muffins (16): 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had: 
3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds of candy.

Since they want to share it equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:
12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies. 

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, Adam received $4 in change."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can break down the information as follows:

We know that Christina had a total of 30 days. The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the remaining days were neutral. This pattern suggests that the neutral days are evenly distributed among the remaining days.

Let's calculate the number of neutral days:
Total days = 30
Good days = 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (additional good days) = 11
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = 30 - (11 + 8) = 11

Now, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month:
Good days left = Total good days - Total good days accounted for
= 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days)
= 15

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate 'x', we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we first convert the initial height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the initial height of 20 feet is equivalent to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Next, we need to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the initial height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating each dog requires one toy. This establishes a baseline of 4 toys.

The shelter has 8 additional dogs, bringing the total to 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James requires 12 toys.

Upon returning, the number of dogs has doubled to 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. However, 3 dogs have left, reducing the total to 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Consequently, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount Skyler invested, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the amount Dylan invested, which is 2/5 of the total amount. This can be calculated as:

2/5 * 1200 = 480

Next, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
1200 - 480 = 720

Then, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount:
(2/3) * 720 = 480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested:
720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can start by finding the total number of signatures they have already collected. 

Let's add the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer have: 
20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we can subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 
100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we need to calculate her hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours she works per day and the number of days.

Karen's hourly wage is twice Lorie's wage, and Lorie earns $10 per hour. Therefore, Karen's hourly wage is 2 x $10 = $20.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings can be calculated as $20 x 3 = $60.

To find her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 x 2 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can use a simple ratio-based approach. 

We know that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns. To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"To determine the excess weight, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 individuals. 

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Multiplying this by 9 gives us the total weight of the group:

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can start by finding the number of cookies each individual has.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's cookies. Therefore, we can express Max's cookies as:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can express the Cookie Monster's cookies as:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can express Summer's cookies as:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies of all three:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Let's denote the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as T and the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode as R. We know that T = 60 minutes and R = 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can set up the equation:

T/2 + R/2 = Total time

Substituting the values of T and R, we get:

60/2 + 40/2 = Total time
30 + 20 = Total time
50 minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to consider the total time available and the time spent walking to the fire station.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

The total time spent walking is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

To find the remaining time, we subtract the total time spent walking from the total time available:

30 - 19 = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the expenses as follows:

- The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
- The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
- The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine paid is $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies baked, we must first calculate the number of cookies baked by Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten by the pair, which is 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, the age of the older triplet would be x + 7, and the age of the older twin would be x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet ages, as fractional ages are not possible in this context. 

The age of the younger triplet is 7 years old.

The age of the older triplet is 14 years old.

The age of the older twin is 21 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the number of minutes John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time John has for his homework. He has 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. Adding these together, we get 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the time John has available for a nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we can multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10:
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

To find the total cost of 10 candies, we can multiply the cost of one candy by 10:
10 candies * $3.20 = $32.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to determine their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of coins saved per year for Rong is 20 * 12 = 240 coins, and for Neil is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

To find the total number of coins saved after 10 years, we multiply the total coins saved per year by 10. 
Rong's total coins after 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total coins after 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The combined total of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is the cost of the heartworm check. We can write this as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He spent $100 on the vet visit, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To determine the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we must first calculate the number of each color of squares.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the values of B and G in terms of R into the equation for W:
W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can express all the variables in terms of R:
B = R + 4
G = R + 10
W = R - 2

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the sum of the areas of all the squares:
Total Area = R + B + G + W
Total Area = R + (R + 4) + (R + 10) + (R - 2)
Total Area = 4R + 12

We know that R = 14, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
Total Area = 4(14) + 12
Total Area = 56 + 12
Total Area = 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is 68."
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the ratio of regular chairs to high chairs. Given that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required. The total number of attendees includes 42 adults and 15 babies, so we add these numbers together:

Total number of attendees = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Now, we can find the number of chairs Mia needs to get by subtracting the number of high chairs from the total number of attendees:

Number of chairs Mia needs to get = Total number of attendees - Number of high chairs
= 57 - 8
= 49

Therefore, Mia needs to acquire 49 more chairs."
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we must first calculate the number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of bucks by 0.2.

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points collected by the students, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of points Tom has as 'x'. Since Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, Marta has 3x points.

We know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Betty has x + 30 points.

We also know that Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, who has 50 points. This can be expressed as:
Betty's points = Adam's points + 0.3 * Adam's points
x + 30 = 50 + 0.3 * 50
x + 30 = 50 + 15
x + 30 = 65
x = 35

Now that we know Tom has 35 points, we can find Marta's points:
Marta's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Marta's points: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

To find the number of points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. We start with the initial number of children, which is 3. Each of these children has 3 children of their own, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Then, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, leading to 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

This problem can be represented using the formula for exponential growth: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number. In this case, a_1 = 3, r = 3, and n = 3. Plugging in these values, we get a_3 = 3 * 3^(3-1) = 3 * 3^2 = 3 * 9 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

**Answer: 27**"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she sets aside for retirement and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 x $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 x $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she sets aside for retirement and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first calculate the total number of pencils present. Since there are 20 spaces available and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, the correct answer is 8 pairs of pencils."
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the total number of fireworks in the city and in her backyard.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, resulting in a total of 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate 40% of 300 as 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

In addition to the fireworks she can see from the city, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which amounts to 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard: 120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent, we must calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and 12 friends + 7 more friends). Each person requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as 'x'. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

When the three trucks are combined, their total capacity is 11,600 pounds. This can be represented by the equation:

4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600

Combine like terms:

8,800 + x = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:

x = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can start by establishing the number of dumplings each gender consumed. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and there are 8 males, the number of dumplings each male ate is 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 + 32 = 50. Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of money Gerald had left, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. Gerald's share is 3 parts, so his initial amount is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can subtract this amount from his initial amount to find the amount he has left: 60 - 10 = 50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we can divide the speed of the cat by 5, as the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can start by finding the remaining amount they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked (3 hours) to find the hourly amount.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to work.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as follows:

80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.32 * 100 = 32%

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we can multiply the number of days in 2 weeks by her daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be:
14 days x $12 per day = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the hourly production rates. The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour. The vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00 budget. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find the maximum number of scoops she can buy:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means that for every 3 scoops Erin buys, she only pays for 2. To find the total number of scoops she can get for her money, we can divide her budget by the cost of 3 scoops:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 (per 3 scoops) = 4 sets of 3 scoops

Since each set includes 3 scoops, Erin can get a total of 4 sets × 3 scoops per set = 12 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 12 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of days in the given period. Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find the difference in their remaining candy, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 square feet is calculated as (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is 576."
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of James' decision, we must calculate the total cost of both options.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as follows: 

Initial cost: $20
Additional cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30

Total cost of picking blueberries = Initial cost + (Additional cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
Total cost of picking blueberries = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of picking blueberries = $20 + $45
Total cost of picking blueberries = $65

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store can be calculated as follows:

Cost per pound: $2.5
Total pounds picked: 30

Total cost of buying blueberries = Cost per pound * Total pounds picked
Total cost of buying blueberries = $2.5 * 30
Total cost of buying blueberries = $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:

Savings = Total cost of buying blueberries - Total cost of picking blueberries
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 x $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 x 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories contributed by each component. 

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories. 

Next, we'll calculate the calories from the cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories. 

Lastly, we'll calculate the calories from the ham: 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we'll sum up the calories from each component: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

Therefore, the omelet has 770 calories."
"To determine the change, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3. 
The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2. 
The total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the total cost is $5 and the payment was $10, the change can be calculated as follows:
$10 - $5 = $5

Therefore, the change is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews. This is 30% of the total applicants, which is 0.3 * 100 = 30.

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer. This is 20% of those who received interviews, which is 0.2 * 30 = 6.

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position. This is one-third of those who received a job offer, which is 6 / 3 = 2.

Therefore, 2 people accept the position."
"To determine the total weight of rice given away, we can calculate the number of sacks given away and multiply it by the weight of each sack.

The total number of sacks given away is 3 (to the cousin) + 4 (to the brother) = 7 sacks.

Since each sack weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

Therefore, the total weight of rice given away is 175 kilograms."
"To determine the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we can use a simple subtraction operation.

Let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week: 3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes.

Now, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week (4) from the total number of boxes she bought this week (8).

8 - 4 = 4

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we must consider the varying tap rates and the duration of each scenario.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute, resulting in a combined rate of 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps during this period is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute, resulting in a combined rate of 400 taps per minute. She dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, so the total number of taps during this period is 400 * 2 = 800.

To find the overall total, we add the number of taps during each scenario: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $645.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is $645 (total cost) - $120 (fine) = $525.

Therefore, Ron saves $525 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To determine the total number of chairs left, we must first calculate the initial total number of chairs and then subtract the number sent for repair.

The initial total number of chairs is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 170 + 23 = 193.

Next, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair, which is the sum of normal chairs and baby chairs: 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total: 193 - 33 = 160.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find the number of slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60: (4/3) x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 80 - 18 =  -20. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, this indicates an error in the calculation.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. So, they ate a total of 8 x 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat, so the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we can use the formula for average: (sum of individual times) / 2.

The sum of the individual times is 30 (cat's time) + 20 (dog's time) = 50 minutes.

The average time is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

Let's start by finding the total number of windows smashed for students' cars. We know that there are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. To find the total number of windows, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

64 students' cars * 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Next, we'll find the total number of windows smashed for teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Again, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

32 teachers' cars * 2 windows per car = 64 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to find the overall total:

256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320 windows

Therefore, Hannah smashed a total of 320 windows."
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools. This can be achieved by adding the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by summing the quantities of all spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted, we can find this number by multiplying 5000 by 2/5.

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Next, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. We subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, so we multiply 3000 by 2/3.

3000 * (2/3) = 2000

Finally, we find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people.

3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can use the following calculation:

Number of packs = Total number of days / Number of pieces of gum per day
= 30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day
= 7.5

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. Therefore, the minimum number of packs required is 8.

The correct answer is 8."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of smores needed. 

We have 9 kids who want 2 smores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each. The total number of smores needed is:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can find the number of sleeves required by dividing the total number of smores needed by 8:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be represented as 2 * 15 + 8, which equals 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age to find her mother's age, which is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages together: 15 (Dora's age) + 38 (father's age) + 34 (mother's age) = 87 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can use the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of $20 and 4 siblings, including Greg. 

The formula for division is: Total Amount ÷ Number of Siblings = Amount per Sibling

Applying this formula, we get: $20 ÷ 4 = $5

Therefore, each sibling, including Greg, received $5."
"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we calculate the combined weight of the math and science books: 2 pounds each, so 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Next, we add the weight of the French book: 4 pounds.

Then, we add the weight of the English book: 3 pounds.

Finally, we calculate the weight of the history book, which is twice as much as the English book: 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can start by calculating the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, and candidate A received 20% of the total votes, we can calculate candidate B's votes as follows:

Candidate B's votes = 20% of 100 + (50% of 20)
= 0.2 * 100 + 0.5 * 20
= 20 + 10
= 30 votes

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

Candidate C's votes = Total votes - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)
= 100 - (20 + 30)
= 100 - 50
= 50 votes

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial amount of apples each person has and the change in their apple count after the transaction.

Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris's new apple count is 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck's new apple count is 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find the difference in their apple counts, we subtract Beck's new amount from Boris's new amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the amount of water left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used for each type of cube:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using algebra to represent the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can represent Clara's books as 2x.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we first need to establish the cost of each type of jar. 

A gallon jar costs $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

The cost of 10-gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.

The cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can start by finding the number of students who like to play music. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

Since the total number of students who like to play basketball, bake, or play music is 10 + 5 + 10 = 25, the remaining students must like to play video games. 

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - 25 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds.

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

The remaining birds after the initial scare are 12 - 4 = 8.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Now, the total number of birds is 8 + 20 = 28.

Therefore, the current number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40

This means each class has 40 students.

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake.
2. Mara added 3 slices, so now the plate has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She tripled the number of slices, so now the plate has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. She ate 2 slices, so now the plate has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so now the plate has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we must first calculate the total number of animals in need of grooming. This can be achieved by adding the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)
Total number of animals = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

The total value of the cards Mark found is the sum of the values of the two cards and the 30 cards worth $50 each:
$4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of each amusement park, we can use the given fees and the number of family members. 

The first amusement park charges $26 for each adult and $12 for each child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:

Cost = (2 adults * $26) + (2 children * $12)
Cost = $52 + $24
Cost = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 for each adult and $10 for each child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:

Cost = (2 adults * $14) + (2 children * $10)
Cost = $28 + $20
Cost = $48

To find the amount saved by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:

Amount saved = Cost of the first park - Cost of the second park
Amount saved = $76 - $48
Amount saved = $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the daily savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day. 

The original cost per day is 500 tomatoes * $0.5 = $250. 
The new cost per day is 500 tomatoes * $0.4 = $200.

Daily savings: $250 - $200 = $50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 * 7 = $350

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to establish a relationship between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as K.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = K/2. Substituting S = 56, we get 56 = K/2, which implies K = 112.

Additionally, we are given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S. Substituting S = 56, we get C = 4 * 56 = 224.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their individual amounts: C + K = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, given that 12 groups are already required.

Since 54 students are already divided into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 12, which equals 4.5. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can conclude that the 54 students are already in the required 12 groups.

Therefore, no additional groups are needed to form the required 12 groups.

The answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to consider the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200. 
The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total chairs rented in one month by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found, we can break down the sequence of events:

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, leaving Gunther with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. Then, Gunther added 25 bananas, bringing the total to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas, resulting in 49 - 12 = 37 bananas. Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, giving him a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, on the third day, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

Final answer: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity cost per roommate, we can calculate the monthly cost per roommate and then multiply it by 12.

The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 4 roommates. To find the monthly share per roommate, we divide the total bill by the number of roommates:

$100 ÷ 4 = $25

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share per roommate:

$25 * 12 = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we must first calculate the initial quantities and then subtract the number of broken items.

The initial number of glasses is 8 dozen, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, the initial number of plates is 4 dozen, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

We then subtract the number of broken items: 10 glasses and 6 plates. 

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of remaining items is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates: 86 + 42 = 128.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end, we need to break down the transactions step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can break down the information as follows:

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

To find the total number of matches played, we add the matches played on each day: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can break down the information into parts and calculate the number of students for each size.

Let's start with the number of students for each size:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To calculate the amount after the discount, we need to find 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

The marked price is $140. To find 5% of this amount, we multiply $140 by 0.05.

$140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

Therefore, the amount after the discount is $133."

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to calculate the percentage of the total number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win, and then subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who think horse #2 will win: 20% of 50 people, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find the number of people who think horse #7 will win: 60% of the remaining people. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we add the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win: 10 + 24 = 34 people.

To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the total number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people: 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as x. We can set up the equation: 
1/3 * x = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
x = 6 * 3
x = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to buy the camera, we must first calculate the amount of money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that the total number of cases required for all three houses is 250. 

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the total, it will require x/2 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will require 2x cases.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cases: x + x/2 + 2x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + x + 4x = 500.

Combining like terms, we get 7x = 500.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 500/7, which is approximately 71.43.

Since the third house needs double the amount of the first house, it will require 2x = 2 * 71.43 = 142.86 cases.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the third house will need approximately 143 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 143"
"To determine the total amount spent, we can calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila's purchase of 3 cucumbers at $2 each results in a total cost of 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack's purchase of 5 tomatoes at $1 each results in a total cost of 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase's purchase of 1 head of lettuce at $3 results in a total cost of $3.

The total amount spent is $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we can start by finding the number of pears. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of bananas by 1.45 (100% + 45% = 145%, or 1.45 as a decimal).

Number of pears = 200 * 1.45 = 290

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears:
Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is 490."
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount of money she had.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we can start by finding the number of kilograms of oranges required. Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters would require 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The cost of oranges is $3 per kilogram. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram: 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of making 4 liters of juice is $60."
"To determine the total number of books read, we can break down the information into steps.

First, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'x'. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, the number of books Ezra read is 2x.

We are given that Ezra read 300 books in total. This includes the initial 300 books and the additional 150 books he decided to read. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 150 = 300

To solve for x, we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 300 - 150
2x = 150

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 150 / 2
x = 75

Now that we know Ahmed read 75 books, we can find the total number of books read by adding the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150), and also adding the number of books Ahmed read (75).

Total books read = 300 + 150 + 75
Total books read = 525

The total number of books read is 525."
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to consider her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus for teaching more than 3 classes.

First, let's calculate her earnings for each day separately. 

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her total hours worked is 4 * 5 = 20 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be 20 hours * $15 per hour = $300.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total hours worked is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be 4 hours * $15 per hour = $60.

As Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, we need to check if she meets this condition on both days. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she earns the bonus. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the bonus.

Now, let's add the total earnings for both days, including the bonus for Monday: $300 + $60 + $10 = $370.

The final answer is: $370"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

The difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents is 4."
"To determine the selling price per ear of corn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the selling price per ear of corn as 'x'. Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135 and he has already made $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each, we can represent the total amount he needs to make from selling the corn as:

25x = 135 - 60
25x = 75

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:

x = 75 / 25
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we must first calculate the total available time for leisure activities. 

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Tatiana dedicates 3 hours to reading. The remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She then allocates 1/3 of the remaining time to video games, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"To find the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils, we can multiply 50 by 1/2 to find the number of pencils given to Brandon.

1/2 * 50 = 25

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Brandon from the total number of pencils Anthony initially had.

50 - 25 = 25

Next, we need to calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find the number of pencils given to Charlie, we multiply the remaining pencils by 3/5.

3/5 * 25 = 15

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we must consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. We can calculate the time taken to drive to the museum as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives at the same speed for the return trip, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours.

The total time spent driving is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time taken to drive back home:
Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total driving time = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, we get the total time Jack is gone from home:
Total time = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the assembly of the toys. 

We know that each car requires 4 wheels and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed can be calculated as follows:

Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

The total number of wheels required is the sum of the wheels for cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, there will be 276 wheels left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we can use the formula:

Discounted Price = Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price)

In this case, the original price is $1000 and the discount percentage is 20% or 0.20.

Discounted Price = $1000 - (0.20 * $1000)
= $1000 - $200
= $800

Therefore, the price after the discount is $800."
"To determine the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series, which is one-third of the total number of movies:
1/3 * 600 = 200 movies

Since Mike can purchase these series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we calculate the cost of the series as:
200 * $10 / 6 = $333.33

Next, we find the number of movies that are not in series. This is done by subtracting the number of series movies from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

We then determine the number of older movies, which is 40% of the remaining movies:
0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is calculated as:
160 * $5 = $800

Now, we find the number of remaining movies that are neither in series nor older movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

Since these movies are neither in series nor older, they cost the same as normal movies, which is $10 each. Therefore, the cost of these movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the series, the older movies, and the remaining movies to find the total cost:
$333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound, which equals $12.00. 
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound, which equals $8.00. 
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound, which equals $18.00.

The total cost is the sum of these individual costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to their vacation spot, we must first calculate the speed at which they hiked. 

The driving speed is given as 50 miles per hour. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their hiking speed as follows:
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we can multiply the hiking speed by the time:
Distance = Hiking speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate their individual scores based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

We know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries. Since each berry is worth 5 points, Emma's berry points are 8 * 5 = 40.

Emma also jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 0 enemies. Since each enemy is worth 10 points, Emma's enemy points are 0 * 10 = 0.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 seconds. Since each second is worth 30 points, Emma's time points are 30 * 30 = 900.

Emma's total score is the sum of her enemy points, berry points, and time points: E = 0 + 40 + 900 = 940.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies. Since each enemy is worth 10 points, Ava's enemy points are 80 * 10 = 800.

Ava collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries. Since each berry is worth 5 points, Ava's berry points are 3 * 5 = 15.

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 30 + 4 = 34 seconds. Since each second is worth 30 points, Ava's time points are 34 * 30 = 1020.

Ava's total score is the sum of her enemy points, berry points, and time points: A = 800 + 15 + 1020 = 1835.

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1835 - 940 = 895.

The final answer is 895."
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can start by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 ÷ 2 = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. The total number of times for these 2 days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times for both the usual days and the extra days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish (this is not possible, so we will use the second scenario for our calculation).

Let's use the second scenario: 14 orange fish were taken out, and 3 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 + 14 = 17 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

After adding the new fish to the pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x.

The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + 14 = 17.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

17 = 2(4 + x)

9 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

4.5 = x

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in a week. Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of working days is 5. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day.

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon.

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Finally, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week by multiplying the amount of gas consumed by the price per gallon, which is $3.

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the twenties she spent.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, each yielding 22 tomatoes, and 8 eggplant plants, each yielding 4 eggplants.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall total: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

Therefore, Ricardo can expect to harvest 142 fruits from his garden."
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 = $150.

Therefore, John is missing $150.

Final answer: $150"

Since each log provides a 5-degree increase in temperature, we can find the required number of logs by dividing the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4.

To ensure the house remains warm enough, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to calculate the number of groups. 

The number of groups can be found by dividing the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 172. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, leaving us with 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, resulting in 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can use the formula:

Total money = Number of bottle caps per day * Number of days in the month * Value of each bottle cap

Given:
Number of bottle caps per day = 10
Number of days in the month = 30
Value of each bottle cap = $0.25

Total money = 10 * 30 * $0.25
Total money = 300 * $0.25
Total money = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to consider her regular and overtime pay rates. Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour, and she worked 8 hours at this rate. 

For the regular hours, her earnings are:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. Since she worked 3 additional hours, her earnings for these hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first calculate the number of male lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can follow these steps:

First, we need to find 25% of the original price of the jeans, which is $40. 

25% of $40 = 0.25 x $40 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:

$40 - $10 = $30

Finally, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find the amount of money Mike will have left over:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

Let's break it down:

- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired per month: 20
- Total number of months: 3

The total number of employees after 3 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 3 (number of months), a1 = 200 (initial number of employees), and an = 200 + (20 * 3) = 260 (total number of employees after 3 months).

S = 3/2 * (200 + 260)
S = 1.5 * 460
S = 690

Now, we can calculate the total salary paid per month by multiplying the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid per month = 690 * $4000
Total salary paid per month = $2,760,000

Finally, we can calculate the total salary paid after 3 months by multiplying the total salary paid per month by the number of months:

Total salary paid after 3 months = $2,760,000 * 3
Total salary paid after 3 months = $8,280,000

The final answer is: $8,280,000."
"To determine the total caroling time, we can calculate the total seconds for each song and then add them together. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, so the total time for this song is 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so the total time for this song is 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we must first calculate their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a 2-month raise of $0.50 per hour, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received a $1.00 per hour raise, resulting in a wage of $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, which was $10. So, Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since Sally also works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 - $10.50 * 20 = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 times the cost of one loaf, which is $2. Therefore, the total cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 times the cost of one bagel, which is $1. Therefore, the total cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

Final answer: $4"
"To find the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139.
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's score and Nikita's score:
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, we calculate the number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students.

Next, we calculate the number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that total.

First, we add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

1 = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

1 = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 4.2 from both sides gives us:

-3.2 = 0.30x

Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us:

x = 10.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals, then the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.30(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtracting 0.30x from both sides gives us:

0.70x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.70 gives us:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming sessions into two distinct periods.

First, let's calculate the total hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since she plays for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days, we can multiply the number of days by the daily hours played:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Next, we'll calculate the total hours Kris played in the last week. She plays for 2 hours per day for 7 days:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, we'll add the hours played in both periods to find the total hours played so far:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we'll subtract the total hours played from the target:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since both cars are traveling at constant speeds, we can calculate the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph.

Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. The time is 2 hours, and the relative speed is 10 mph. 

Distance = 10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, 20 miles will separate the two cars."
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to find the cost of the premium. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's start by finding the number of fifth-graders who passed. Since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, we can calculate it as follows:

Fifth-graders who passed = 2 * 40
= 80

Now, we can find the total number of students who passed:
Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders)
= 460

The total number of students in the school is the sum of students in each grade:
Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders)
= 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is 46."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total number of glass chips available. Since each bag holds 72 chips and Milo has two bags, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Next, we need to find the total area of the mosaic. We know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch. To find the total area, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by multiplying the area by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 36 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has. 

Dale initially had 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. 

However, he sold 150 candies, leaving him with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Since Dale wants to sell all of his candies, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x = 50, where x is the number of candies he still needs to sell.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

The number of students doubles at the end of every month. We can represent this as an exponential function: 

A = P * 2^n, where A is the number of students at the end of the month, P is the initial number of students (10), and n is the number of months.

We want to find the number of students at the end of May, which is 5 months after the initial month. 

A = 10 * 2^5
A = 10 * 32
A = 320

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week. We know that he made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. To find the total number of branches, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

2. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 x 5 = 5 petals
- 1 x 6 = 6 petals
- 1 x 4 = 4 petals
- 1 x 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we must first calculate the total number of marshmallows available for use. The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows, but 3 were lost. Therefore, the number of marshmallows remaining is 35 - 3 = 32.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores that can be made is equal to the number of marshmallows available, which is 32.

John and DeSean have made a combined total of 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

**Answer:** 16"
"To determine the total cost of the games played, we need to calculate the time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as J, the time his friend plays as F1, and the time the better friend plays as F2. We know that F1 and F2 play for half the time of J, so F1 = 0.5J and F2 = 1.5J.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation: J + F1 + F2 = 240.

Substituting the expressions for F1 and F2, we get: J + 0.5J + 1.5J = 240.

Combine like terms: 3J = 240.

Divide both sides by 3: J = 80.

Now that we know Jack plays for 80 minutes, we can find the time played by F1 and F2: F1 = 0.5 * 80 = 40 minutes and F2 = 1.5 * 80 = 120 minutes.

The cost per game is 20 minutes per quarter, so the cost per minute is $0.25. We can calculate the cost for each person:

Jack's cost: 80 minutes * $0.25 = $20
F1's cost: 40 minutes * $0.25 = $10
F2's cost: 120 minutes * $0.25 = $30

The total cost is the sum of the costs: $20 + $10 + $30 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest is also x ounces.

Given that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces. Additionally, since Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x ounces.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Since the amount of salt and citrus zest is x, and the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of fragrance is also x.

So, the equation is: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5: x = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the amount of oil used. The amount of oil is 2x, so the amount of oil used is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 goats * $500 = $1500. 

Next, we multiply the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Finally, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, we need to find the total number of cupcakes Paul already has. Since he has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, we can add these two numbers together.

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Next, we subtract the total number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cars Joe has. Since Robert has 20 cars and Joe has twice as many, we can calculate Joe's initial car count as 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we need to determine the number of cars Joe sells. 20% of his cars are sold, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe gives away. He gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, we subtract the number of cars given away from Joe's remaining cars: 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the amount each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the charity by the number of students. 

The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and there are 20 students. 

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by charity / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $175,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $8,750

The final answer is: $8,750"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to consider the time she spent walking on each day. 

Let's denote the time she walked on the first day as 'x'. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is x/2.

The total time she walked in the two days is the sum of the time she walked on each day, which is x + x/2. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2. So, we can rewrite x as 2x/2. Now, we can add the fractions:

Total time = 2x/2 + x/2 = 3x/2

We are given that the total time is 12 hours. To find the value of x, we can set up the equation:

3x/2 = 12

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the total time in minutes. We already know that x = 8 hours. To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

Total time in minutes = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the parking lot had 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that remained, we can calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 35. 

To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to determine the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the pay per task.

First, we calculate the total number of tasks per day: 5 tasks per cycle * 30 cycles per day = 150 tasks per day.

Next, we multiply the total number of tasks per day by the number of days in a week: 150 tasks per day * 7 days per week = 1050 tasks per week.

Finally, we multiply the total number of tasks per week by the pay per task: 1050 tasks per week * $1.20 per task = $1260 per week.

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can use the following steps:

First, calculate the total number of tins of cat food by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, calculate the total number of tins of dog food by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of eggs of each color as follows:

- G = number of green eggs
- B = number of blue eggs
- P = number of pink eggs
- Y = number of yellow eggs

We are given the following information:
1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P / 3

We can substitute the values of B and P in terms of G into the equation for Y:
Y = (B - 1) / 3
Y = (2G - 1) / 3

Now, we can express B and Y in terms of G:
B = 2G
Y = (2G - 1) / 3

We can now express the total number of eggs in terms of G:
Total = G + B + P + Y
Total = G + 2G + (2G - 1) + (2G - 1) / 3
Total = 5G + 2G + 2G - 1 + (2G - 1) / 3
Total = 9G - 2 + (2G - 1) / 3

To simplify the equation, we can multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3 * Total = 27G - 6 + 2G - 1
3 * Total = 29G - 7

Since we know that G = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation:
3 * Total = 29 * 5 - 7
3 * Total = 145 - 7
3 * Total = 138

Now, we can solve for Total:
Total = 138 / 3
Total = 46

Therefore, Cindy had 46 eggs altogether."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

The cost of shipping the book is calculated as follows:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's purchase price:
$32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost:
$3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21

However, since Milly can't lose money, we consider the cost of the book itself. The cost of the book is $32, and Milly will receive a refund of $24. So, she will lose:
$32 (book cost) - $24 (refund) = $8

Therefore, Milly will lose $8.

$8"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. Additionally, she buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract it from the total monthly production.

The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. 

The production for the first week is 8,000 bars. The second week's production is half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week's production is three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, we add the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she dedicates to writing songs and doing makeup.

First, let's calculate the time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours. 

Next, we need to convert the time spent doing makeup from minutes to hours: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week.

Now, we add the time spent on both activities: 8 hours (songwriting) + 1.5 hours (makeup) = 9.5 hours/week.

To find the total time spent on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the items into standard and additional items.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these standard items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we subtract the standard quantities from the quantities Angela has:

- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:
- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has, we can break down the information provided. 

First, we know that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we are told that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4, which equals $12.

Finally, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total. $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we need to establish a common unit of measurement. Let's use inches as the base unit.

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can break down the problem into two segments: the initial 4 hours and the subsequent 6 hours.

For the first 4 hours, the distance covered can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours, the distance covered can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances covered in both segments:

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time for kangaroos = 18 hours
Time for turtles = Distance / Speed of a turtle
Since the distance is the same, we can set up a proportion: 
Time for kangaroos / Speed of a kangaroo = Time for turtles / Speed of a turtle
18 / 6 = x / 3
x = 9

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, the number of dishes made by Rory as R, and the number of dishes made by Jada as J.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes, so K = 20.

We also know that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so J = 2R = 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can find the total number of dishes by adding the number of dishes made by each of them: Total = K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old one. The original price is $600, and the trade-in value is $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Next, we consider the additional funds Erika has received. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. The total amount of these funds is $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The equation is x + $230 = $400 - $50.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + $230 = $350.

To solve for x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation:

x = $350 - $230

x = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total number of apple slices, we must consider the slicing capacity of both large and small apples. 

A large apple yields 5 slices, while a small apple yields 3 slices. 

Let's calculate the total number of slices from the given quantities:
3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

The total number of slices is the sum of these two quantities: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the remaining number of slices is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the number of cows needed as 'x'. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the following equation:

5x = 25

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 additional cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

We know that a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally. 

For the first glue stick, 5/6 of 12 mm is 10 mm, so 1/6 of 12 mm is 2 mm. 
For the second glue stick, 1/3 of 12 mm is 4 mm, so 2/3 of 12 mm is 8 mm. 
For the third glue stick, 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm, so 1/2 of 12 mm is 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To determine the amount Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

To find the amount Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we must first calculate the total amount she paid. Since she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, the total amount paid is:

4 * $20 = $80

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount paid to find the change:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent. He acquired 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 * $2 = $12. Additionally, he purchased 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to an additional expenditure of 3 * $3 = $9. The combined total spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig initially possessed 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equates to 2 * $20 = $40. To find the remaining funds, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final amount Craig has left is $19."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jack collected 60 dishes and that he has twice as many dishes as socks. This means that the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2:
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of dishes Jack has by 2:
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can add the number of socks and dishes they have together:
60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find the total number of students good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

We know that T = M + E - B.

Given:
T = 20
M (good at math only) = 5
E (good at English only) = 8

We are asked to find M (total good at math). Since the number of students good at both subjects is not directly provided, we can express it as B = M + E - T.

Substituting the given values, we get:
B = 5 + 8 - 20
B = -7

However, the number of students cannot be negative. This indicates that the given information is inconsistent. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the question states ""the rest are good at both math and English."" This implies that the number of students good at both subjects is the difference between the total number of students and the sum of students good at math only and students good at English only.

Correcting the approach:
B = T - (M + E)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

M = M (good at math only) + B
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. 

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to account for a 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total available time for performances is:

120 minutes (total time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Each group takes 10 minutes to perform. To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the total available time by the time taken by each group:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Since the question does not provide any options, I will provide the answer in the required format:

The final answer is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount ($300), r is the annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75), and t is the time in years (3).

First, we need to calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we add the interest earned each year to the principal amount:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = $750 + $225 = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. 

The total number of eggs is 900, and each tray holds 30 eggs. 

900 ÷ 30 = 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of goats left in each farm. 

Farm X initially had 55 goats and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Farm Y initially had 45 goats and twice as many were sold, which means 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can divide the total annual expenditure by the number of pairs purchased. 

The total annual expenditure is $2640, and James buys 2 pairs of shoes per year. 

Average cost per pair = Total annual expenditure / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

Therefore, the average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

For the red food, we have 3 baskets, but we get $2 off for each basket. So, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. The cost of the red food after the discount is $18 - $2 = $16 per basket. Therefore, the total cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $16 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we calculate the number of homes built in the first year, which is given as 12.

Next, we calculate the number of homes built in the second year. Since they build three times the number of homes built in the first year, we multiply 12 by 3, resulting in 36 homes.

In the third year, the town doubles the total number of homes built in the first two years. This can be calculated as 2 * (12 + 36), which equals 2 * 48, resulting in 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the ages of the individuals involved. Let's use 'x' to represent the age of the person in question, 'x + 3' for the brother's age, 'x - 2' for the sister's age, and '3(x + 3) - 1' for the mother's age.

The sum of their ages is given as 87, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5x = 78

Divide by 5:

x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the age of the person in question is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs, we can divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). 

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The correct answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day. This means the initial amount of 4000 gallons is multiplied by 2, resulting in 8000 gallons.

Next, we are given that the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons on the third day. To find the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we add the increase of 6000 gallons to the amount on the second day, which is 8000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of infected people on each day can be represented as a geometric sequence. 

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as a = 10 and the common ratio as r = 6 (since each infected person infects 6 others). The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is an = a * r^(n-1).

We want to find the total number of infected people after 3 days. To do this, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: Sn = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.

In this case, n = 3, a = 10, and r = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S3 = 10 * (1 - 6^3) / (1 - 6)
S3 = 10 * (1 - 216) / (-5)
S3 = 10 * (-215) / (-5)
S3 = 10 * 43
S3 = 430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after 3 days is 430.

The final answer is 430."
"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can use the concept of percentages. 

First, we know that Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so her total tips can be calculated as 40 * $20 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can find her total tips by calculating 90% of Rafaela's total tips. This can be done by multiplying Rafaela's total tips by 0.9.

$800 * 0.9 = $720

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we add their individual totals together.

$800 + $720 = $1520

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $1520."
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, we need to find the total number of oranges given away. Since Jennifer gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, we can calculate this as 2 x 3 = 6 oranges. Additionally, she gave 3 oranges to her son. 

The total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the total number of slices sold. Since Paige baked 2 loaves per hour and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices can be found by multiplying the number of loaves by 8.

2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves
10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice.

80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

Therefore, Paige raised $40 in the fundraiser."
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We are given that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins to be 40, we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we must first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
Total burritos eaten = 20

Now, we subtract the total burritos eaten from the total burritos given to the students to find the leftover burritos.
Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the number of yellow cars, we must first establish the number of green cars. Since the rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars, which is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall total. The total number of cars is 75. 

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables. Let Fawn have x books, Anne have y books, and Sofie have z books.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

Lastly, we know that together, they have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: z + y + x = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(y + 25) + y + x = 85

Combine like terms:

2y + x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:

2y + x = 60

Now, we can substitute y = x - 12 into this equation:

2(x - 12) + x = 60

Expand the equation:

2x - 24 + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we must first calculate the number of boxes required. 

We know that a 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. Since Greg wants to provide 4 jello cups for each of the 30 kids attending the party, we can calculate the total number of cups needed as follows:

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. We can do this by dividing the total cups needed by the number of cups per box:

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Since each box costs $1.25, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's outdoor birthday party."
"To determine the change, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given. 

The total cost of the phones is found by multiplying the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we must first calculate his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4. 

$400 * 0.4 = $160

Now, we divide the monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find Keenan's weekly expenditure. 

$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60, which represents the number of pieces he ate on the first day. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

Next, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total to find the remaining pieces: 
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, we subtract these from the remaining pieces:
36 - 10 = 26 pieces

Now, we need to find 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, which represents the number of pieces he ate on the third day.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

Finally, we add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total cost, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the soda and the cost of the water.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can find the cost of 1 bottle of soda by dividing $21.00 by 7. This gives us $3.00 per bottle.

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by the number of bottles David wants to buy, which is 3. So, 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can find the cost of 1 bottle of water by dividing $8.00 by 4. This gives us $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of water by the number of bottles David wants to buy, which is 2. So, 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water to find the total cost. $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can follow a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03 and David is purchasing 16 bolts, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = Number of Bolts * Cost per Bolt
Total Cost = 16 * $0.03
Total Cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:
Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining Amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To determine Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked. 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: 
$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him 28 marbles. This can be calculated by adding 52 (initial marbles) and 28 (marbles given by his friend), resulting in 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. This can be calculated by multiplying 80 (total marbles) by 1/4, which equals 20 marbles.

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles lost (20) from the total number of marbles Paul has (80) to find the number of marbles he has left. This results in 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to consider the weighted value of each type of question. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, while the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points.

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points.

Lastly, we'll calculate the points from the long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points.

Now, we'll add up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the cost of each chicken, we need to calculate the total cost of the chickens sold and then divide it by the number of chickens sold.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. This means he will sell 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

The selling price of each chicken is $50. To find the total cost of the chickens sold, we can set up an equation: Total Cost = Total Revenue - Profit.

Let's denote the cost of each chicken as x. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens is 180 * $50 = $9000. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens sold is $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Now, we can set up the equation: 180x = $7000, where x is the cost of each chicken.

To find the cost of each chicken, we divide both sides of the equation by 180: x = $7000 / 180.

x = $38.89

The final answer is $38.89."
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we can use the following steps:

First, we know that the total number of glasses sold is 32. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, the remaining glasses were sold by Micah and Mitchell. 

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as x. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold x glasses. 

We can set up the equation: 14 + x + x = 32

Combine like terms: 14 + 2x = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides: 2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

Difference = Julie's sales - Micah's sales
= 14 - 9
= 5

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the number of years when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

In 16 years, her age will be x + 16. According to the problem, this age will be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation:

x + 16 = 3x

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 16 = 3x
16 = 3x - x
16 = 2x
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age:

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since she is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24:

24 - 8 = 16 years.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, the cost of each packet of chicken is 2 x $10 = $20.

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. 

We can write the equation as follows:
2x + 15 = 65

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes."
"To find the current number of toys Argo has, we need to subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initial number of toys = 200
Toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we can break down the problem into parts. 

First, we calculate the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since they make the same number of chimichangas on both days, we can simply multiply the number of chimichangas made on one day by 2. 

The total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is 2 * 125 = 250.

Next, we calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays. Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays, we multiply the number of chimichangas made on one day by 2. 

The total number of chimichangas made on Fridays is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the number of microphones that were not able to fit in pairs. 

20% of the total microphones won't fit, so we calculate 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. Since microphones come in pairs, we can assume that each pair consists of 2 microphones. 

The number of microphones that were able to fit in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that fit by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of birds, we must calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead: 2/3 * 6 = 4.

Next, we calculate the number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of birds is 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the initial total.

Initial cookies: 55
Cookies eaten: 5
Remaining cookies: 55 - 5 = 50

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find the number of cookies in each jar.

Number of jars: 5
Remaining cookies: 50
Cookies per jar: 50 ÷ 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The total number of petals on the orchids can be found by multiplying the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

Similarly, the total number of petals on the daisies can be found by multiplying the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to find the number of flowering plants. 

We know that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so the remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * 2/3 = 50. 

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Setting up the equation 11x = 121, we can solve for x: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we must first calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to first determine his new hourly wage. 

The original hourly wage was $10, and it was increased by $2. 

$10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week.

$12 * 8 * 5 = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now that we know she mowed Joe's lawn 13 times, we can find out how many times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

Kamala's lawn: 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times
Alba's lawn: 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
6 * 13 + 39 + 65 = 6 * 13 + 104 = 6 * 117 = 702

Now, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
702 - 80 = 622

The final answer is: 622"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as X, and Harry's weight as H.

Given:
1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. X = C + 8
4. H = X - 5

Substituting the values, we get:
C = 55 + 16 = 71 kg
X = 71 + 8 = 79 kg
H = 79 - 5 = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to determine his total earnings from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, we calculate the total hours worked per month: 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours.

Next, we calculate his total earnings per month: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Finally, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

Therefore, John's monthly profit is $250."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph had initially as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's initial number of notebooks as 3x.

We are also given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2 / 3
x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph had 2/3 notebooks initially, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2/3 = 7 - 0.67
= 6.33

Therefore, Martha has 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is 6.33."
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can use the information that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Let's denote Dijana's distance as 'x'. Then, Anis's distance can be represented as x + (1/5)x.

We know that Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis's distance:
Anis's distance = x + (1/5)x
= 50 + (1/5)50
= 50 + 10
= 60

To find the total distance rowed by both, we add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
= 50 + 60
= 110

The final answer is 110."
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by Susan's husband. 

Let's denote the total number of cookies as T and the number of nephews as N. We know that T = 100 and N = 6. The husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining cookies are T - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

To find the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: (T - 4) / N = 96 / 6 = 16.

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies."
"To determine the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can break down their reading activities into two parts: yesterday and today.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total remains 13 pages.

To find Denise's total pages read today, we add 5 to the number of pages Daniel read yesterday: 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Now, we can calculate Denise's total pages read:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is:
28 - 13 = 15

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the total capacity of the pot and the number of people eating.

The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since there are four adults, the total capacity of the pot is 4 bowls. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner.

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total amount spent by William, we can use the concept of multiplication and addition. 

First, we multiply the cost of one notebook by the number of notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 

Next, we add the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.50, to the total cost of the notebooks: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total material required, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the material required for small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Solving for x, we get:
x = (2 yards * 20 masks) / 4 masks
x = 10 yards

Now, let's find the material required for large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Solving for x, we get:
x = (2.25 yards * 8 masks) / 3 masks
x = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can use the formula:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

Given that Deepa has spent $216 on 9 movies, each seen three times, we can calculate the total number of tickets as follows:

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 27 tickets

Now, we can calculate the average price per ticket:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours in a day, which is 24. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

The total hours spent on these activities is 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number used from the total number of red shoe boxes:
9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The total number of shoe boxes left is 4 + 6 = 10."
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can start by doubling the number of books Sarah has, as it is given that Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books.

Sarah has 9 books, so Joseph initially had 9 * 2 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books. To find the current number of books he has, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find 1/5 of the total marbles Dean has. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (marbles given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Finally, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get:

60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we must first calculate his hourly production rate. Since he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 per hour, his production rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

With an 8-hour workday, Colby completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Given that he earns $0.20 for each package, his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the total number of bottles of water John drinks, we must first calculate the total time spent on both sudoku puzzles. 

The time for the normal sudoku puzzle is 45 minutes, and the time for the extreme sudoku puzzle is 4 times that, which equals 180 minutes. 

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes. 

Number of bottles of water = Total time / 30 minutes = 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Therefore, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented as 2R + 3Y = 58. We are also given that R = 20.

Substituting R = 20 into the equation, we get:
2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
3Y = 58 - 40
3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
Y = 18 / 3
Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days: 
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we divide the total miles by the interval at which the tune-ups are required (1000 miles):
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down his work hours as follows:

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the initial amount of allowance given to Julia and Nadine, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the items they purchased.

The total amount spent on a cake and 2 tubs of ice cream is $11 + $7 = $18. Additionally, they spent $6 on 1 dozen balloons.

The total amount spent is $18 + $6 = $24.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the initial amount each girl had.

$24 / 2 = $12.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira bought, we can utilize the principle of addition. We have three distinct types of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. The quantities of these fruits are 3, 5, and 6, respectively.

To find the total, we add the quantities of each fruit together: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

However, we must also account for the fact that Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit. To do this, we subtract 2 from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of fruits left is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of students playing volleyball, which is twice the number of students playing tennis. Since there are 6 students playing tennis, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is 16 boys and 22 girls, for a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to determine the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

First, we find the total number of lollipops sold by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Next, we calculate the profit per lollipop by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $0.8 (selling price) - $0.5 (cost price) = $0.3 (profit per lollipop).

Finally, we find the total profit by multiplying the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 lollipops * $0.3 (profit per lollipop) = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate equations for each type of pet.

Let's denote the number of cats as C, dogs as D, rabbits as R, fish as F, and gerbils as G.

We know that:
- C = 3 (number of cats)
- D = 3C (number of dogs is 3 times the number of cats)
- R = D - 2 (number of rabbits is 2 fewer than dogs)
- F = 3R (number of fish is 3 times the number of rabbits)
- G = (1/3)F (number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish)

We can substitute the values we know into the equations to find the number of each pet:
- D = 3C = 3(3) = 9
- R = D - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
- F = 3R = 3(7) = 21
- G = (1/3)F = (1/3)(21) = 7

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: C + D + R + F + G = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh.

Abby's daily consumption is 2 slices, and Josh's consumption is twice that amount, so Josh eats 4 slices per day. The total daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):
24 ÷ 6 = 4

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can use the concept of multiplication. Since she collects one shell per month and has been doing so for 5 years, we can multiply the number of years by 12 to find the total number of months, then multiply that by 1 (since she collects one shell per month).

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months
60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first calculate the total number of mint tea cups. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows to find the number of cups in each row. Since there are 3 rows, we can divide 12 by 3 to find the number of cups in each row.

12 ÷ 3 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we must first calculate the total number of trips he can make within the given time frame. 

Since the total available time is 8 hours, and each round trip (down and back) takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we divide the total desired berries (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip.

24 / 2 = 12

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we must first calculate half of the pool's total water capacity. This is achieved by dividing the pool's capacity by 2, resulting in 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we need to consider the rate at which the tank is being emptied. The tank is being emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water remaining after 6 days, we must subtract the daily rate multiplied by the number of days from the initial amount of water in the tank.

The calculation is as follows: 5,000 - (500 * 6) = 5,000 - 3,000 = 1,000 gallons.

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 1,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we must first calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the popcorn and candy he has already purchased. 

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so his remaining budget is $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, tickets for that day cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so we subtract $10 from his remaining budget: $134 - $10 = $124.

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket to find out how many movies Colby can see. 

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to determine the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

Let's break down the information:

- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since these two days are counted as one, we'll add 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs for the two days.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

The bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can calculate the distance traveled by the bus as follows:

Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car, on the other hand, traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance traveled by the car as follows:

Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

We know that Sophie now has a total of 62 toys, and she already had 48 toys before purchasing the bouncy balls. 

The number of bouncy balls can be found by subtracting the initial number of toys from the total number of toys: 62 - 48 = 14.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Peter's age be P, Paul's age be P + 10, and Jean's age be J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand the equation:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations:

P + J = 35

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides of the second equation:

10 + J = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

J = 25

Now that we have found J, we can substitute J into the first equation:

P + 25 = 35

Subtract 25 from both sides:

P = 10

Therefore, the age of Peter is 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each. This gives us a total of 5 individuals with 2 balloons each, resulting in 5 * 2 = 10 balloons.

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself, bringing the total to 10 + 1 = 11 balloons.

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. With 5 individuals, this adds 5 * 3 = 15 balloons to the total.

Combining the initial 11 balloons with the additional 15 balloons, we get a total of 11 + 15 = 26 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the number of tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. 

The charity group received 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. 

First, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat for each individual. 

For Zoey, the total distance spat is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.

For Sydney, the total distance spat is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

Next, we add the total distances spat by both individuals: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it produces 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will produce 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it produces 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will produce 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6 = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6 = $192,000

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we first calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay, which is 1000 pesos. 

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we compare the cost of the extended stay to the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first calculate the individual hay requirements for each animal.

Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

The amount of hay each sheep requires is 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat requires. This can be calculated as 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay required is the sum of the hay needed for goats and sheep, which is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is 159."
"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we must first calculate his total earnings. 

John's hourly wage is $50, and he worked for 6 hours, resulting in total earnings of $50 * 6 = $300. After spending $50 on gas, he has $300 - $50 = $250 left.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Five pencils at $10 each will cost 5 * $10 = $50. Subtracting this from his remaining funds, John has $250 - $50 = $200 left.

John also wishes to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with $200 - $100 = $100.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens John can purchase, we divide his remaining funds by 25: $100 ÷ $25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can start by calculating the total number of letters spelled by Craig. Since he spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we can multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. To find the total number of letters spelled by Craig's brother, we add 50 to Craig's total:

300 + 50 = 350

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the product of the number of children in each row and the number of rows.

The number of children in each row is given as 8, and there are 7 rows in total. 

The total number of children can be calculated as follows:

Total number of children = Number of children in each row * Number of rows

"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To determine the total cost, we must calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). This results in $78.75.

The total fixed charge is $40.

The cost of parts is $60.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, the total fixed charge, and the cost of parts. 

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount, we multiply the number of CDs by the cost per CD: 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Next, we calculate the discount amount by finding 40% of the total cost: 0.4 * $150 = $60.

The total cost after the discount is then $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To determine how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the total cost after the discount: $90 - $200 = -$110.

The correct answer is: -$110"
"To calculate the total amount Jen will earn, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, we'll calculate the total value of the yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9
Next, we'll calculate the total value of the sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The total amount Jen will earn is $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James spends swimming 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining 40% of the distance at half the speed (1 mile per hour).
Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Distance = 8 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time James spends on the entire journey.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be represented as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a loaf, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sam had approximately 15 loaves of bread last Friday.

Now, we can find the number of loaves the bakery has by multiplying 7 by the number of loaves Sam had and subtracting 40:

7 * 15 - 40 = 105 - 40
= 65

The bakery has 65 loaves of bread.

The final answer is 65."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can break down the events as follows:

Initially, Jasmine received 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find the remaining stickers, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Next, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates. To find the final total, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total commission, we need to find the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

First, we calculate the commission for the New York Times: 6 copies * 10% * $5 = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3.

Next, we calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * 8% * $15 = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12.

Now, we add the commissions together: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can write the equation: M = 0.5L.

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can write another equation: M = D - 5.

Given that Deanna is 26 years old, we can substitute D = 26 into the second equation: M = 26 - 5, which simplifies to M = 21.

Now that we know Marcus's age, we can substitute M = 21 into the first equation: 21 = 0.5L.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 2 * 21 = 0.5L, which simplifies to 42 = 0.5L.

Multiplying both sides by 2 again, we get 2 * 42 = L, which simplifies to L = 84.

Therefore, Leo's age is 84 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 20 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 20) - 10 points. 

The total points scored by all three is 45, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20) + ((x + 20) - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now that we know Dinar scored 5 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (5 + 20) - 10 points
= 25 - 10
= 15

Therefore, Azibo scored 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must consider the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled, we need to determine the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. This period encompasses 13 hours, which is equivalent to 780 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can find the total number of reports stapled by dividing the total minutes by 15.

Total reports = 780 minutes / 15 minutes per report
Total reports = 52

The correct answer is 52."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the minutes she was awake.

Kim's usual sleep duration is 8 hours, which is equivalent to 480 minutes. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. We'll account for this by subtracting 5 minutes from her total sleep time.

Next, we need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by subtracting the time she woke up from her usual wake-up time.

6 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours and 45 minutes
Converting 3 hours and 45 minutes to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes + 45 minutes = 225 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time she was sleepwalking by subtracting the time she went to sleep from her usual sleep time.

480 minutes - 225 minutes = 255 minutes

However, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to the total sleep time.

255 minutes + 23 minutes = 278 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{278}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the number of measuring spoons he has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups is equivalent to 2 x 12 = 24 cups. To find 2/3 of 24 cups, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3:

(2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

This means Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups, and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

Next, we need to consider the daily increase in occupied beds. 50 patients are admitted each day. 

Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700. 

The total number of occupied beds will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the beds admitted over 2 weeks, which is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is 100."
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day.

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find the number of emails to her family. We are told that two-thirds of the remainder are to her family.

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her boyfriend. We are told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (Non-work emails per day - Emails to family per day)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * (9 - 6)
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 3
Emails to boyfriend per day = 1

The final answer is 1."
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can use the given information. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. 

First, we find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3: 
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls = 2x. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2(2x) = 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:
2x = 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1

Now that we know Jeffrey's balls, we can find the total number of balls:
Total balls = Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls + Jordan's balls
Total balls = 2x + x + 4x
Total balls = 7x
Substituting x = 1, we get:
Total balls = 7(1)
Total balls = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

Let x be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes on the fourth day is 29 + x. Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can write the equation:

29 + x = 4(29)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

29 + x = 116

Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get:

x = 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we can start by determining the number of corn chips Collins received. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number the others received, and Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, we can calculate Collins' share as 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the number of corn chips each person received: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To determine the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. Fifty percent of this amount is 0.5 x $400 = $200. 

The cost of travel is the sum of the cost of the supplies and 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A + 4A - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can utilize a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the total number of episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes by dividing the total minutes per episode by 2.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the bird's journey into three segments and calculate the total distance traveled in each direction.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Next, the bird travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is 300 - 36 = 264 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to consider the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. At the office party, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies. Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

The total number of brownies can be calculated by adding these amounts together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we can calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, we'll calculate the time for each type of racquet. 

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we'll add these times together to find the total time: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, the cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total cost of the phones is $2100."
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. We are given that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. This can be expressed as an equation: 

Let x be the number of players in Carlton's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players, the number of players in Zeke's team is x + 7.

We are also given that Carlton's team has 13 players, so we can set up the equation:

x = 13

Now, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by substituting x into the equation: 
x + 7 = 13 + 7
x + 7 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in both teams:
Total players = x + (x + 7)
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is 100."
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we must first calculate the total number of oranges she initially had. Since each box contains 20 oranges and she purchased 12 boxes, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to account for the oranges she gave to her mom and sister. She gave them 2 boxes each, so the total number of oranges given away is 2 * 20 = 40.

To find the number of oranges she kept, we calculate 1/4 of the total: 1/4 * 240 = 60.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find the number of oranges she sold: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Half of 50 is 25. 
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. 

Tyler has saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he must work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we can start by finding the number of cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote Richard's cherries as R. Then, Robert's cherries can be represented as R + 10. We know Robert has 30 cherries, so we can write the equation:

R + 10 = 30

Solving for R, we get:

R = 30 - 10
R = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries (60) and the number of cherries Robert has (30) from Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we need to calculate the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie sales separately and then combine them.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that G = 10 and A = G - 4.

On Sunday, the number of gingerbread boxes sold increased by 5, so the new number of gingerbread boxes sold is G + 5. The number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday decreased by 4, so the new number of apple pie boxes sold is A - 4.

We are given that the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is 15, so G + 5 = 15. Solving for G, we get G = 10.

We also know that the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is 6, so A - 4 = 6. Solving for A, we get A = 10.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 10 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $150

Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $150 = $210
Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $150 = $240

Total earnings for two days: $210 + $240 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total number of hours she will be outside. Since she will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, the total number of hours is:

4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

As her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can calculate the number of bottles needed by dividing the total number of hours by the number of ounces per bottle:

32 hours / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation."
"To find the price of the red car, we can use the concept of percentages. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car by finding 60% of the price of the blue car (100% - 40% = 60%).

60% of $100 = 0.6 x $100 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation: 24 = D/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation: 24 = 2B.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil (19), his dad (48), and his brother (12), we can find the sum of their ages by adding the three ages together: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

The final answer is 79."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of beads given by her mother as M, the number of beads given by her sister as S, and the number of beads given by her friend as F.

We know that M = 20.

We also know that S = M + 10, and F = 2M.

Substituting the value of M into the equations for S and F, we get:
S = 20 + 10 = 30
F = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, we can find the total number of beads by adding M, S, and F:
Total = M + S + F = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

Therefore, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we can break down his daily catches:

- Thursday: 3 pounds
- Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
- Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

First, we convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Next, we subtract the space between each plant (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches) from the total length: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the width of each plant (12 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5.

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

The final answer is: $552"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can start by finding the daily consumption of his brother. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this by multiplying Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2.

Edgar's brother eats 18 pretzels per day * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily amount by 7.

9 pretzels per day * 7 days per week = 63 pretzels per week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of petunias per basket (3) and the cost per petunia ($3.00). This gives us 5 * 3 * 3 = 45.

The cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (5) by the number of vines per basket (2) and the cost per vine ($2.50). This gives us 5 * 2 * 2.50 = 25.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: 45 + 25 = 70.

Therefore, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Since each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil and there are 4 sunflowers, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations. Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and there are 10 carnations. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations to find the total amount of soil used: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, we subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount available: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide that by the cost of each pair of shoes.

First, we find 25% of her monthly income: 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12: $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of each pair of shoes: $6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the process into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, we need to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp: 90 / 30 = 3 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook: 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the final temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

Let's denote the initial temperature as T. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in an additional cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours, resulting in a warming effect of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can express Bill's age at the time he saw the comet as 3(30) = 90 years old.

We also know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is equal to the difference between Bill's age at the time he saw the comet and his dad's age at that time. This can be represented as x = 90 - 30 = 60 years.

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet: 30 + 60 = 90 years old.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3 * 90 = 270 years old. However, this is not the age Bill was when he first saw the comet. To find Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to subtract 75 years from 270, as the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, Bill was 270 - 75 = 195 years old when he first saw the comet.

However, this is not the correct answer. We can re-evaluate the problem by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote Bill's age when he first saw the comet as y. We know that Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3 times his father's age at that time, which is 3(30 + x). We also know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is x. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

y = 3(30 + x)

We also know that the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is equal to the difference between Bill's age at the time he saw the comet and his dad's age at that time, which is x = y - 30. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

y = 3(30 + (y - 30))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 3y - 90

Subtracting 3y from both sides, we get:

-2y = -90

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

y = 45

Therefore, Bill was 45 years old when he first saw the comet.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

We can break down Buford's monthly check-writing activities as follows:

- He writes 1 check for the electric bill and 1 check for the gas bill, totaling 2 checks per month for these bills.
- He writes 2 checks per month for the church.
- He writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service, which is equivalent to 1 check per quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks per month:
2 (electric and gas bills) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month

To find the total number of checks per year, we multiply the monthly total by 12:
4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is:

Greece = (3/4) * 88
Greece = 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights:

Flights to France = x - Greece
Flights to France = 88 - 66
Flights to France = 22

Therefore, the first plane makes 22 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Let's denote the length of Tobias' howl as T, Chikote's howl as C, and Igneous' howl as I. We know that T = 20 seconds.

Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can express this as C = 2T. Substituting the value of T, we get C = 2(20) = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so we can express this as I = T + C. Substituting the values of T and C, we get I = 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: T + C + I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information given. Let's denote the ages of the children as A, B, H, and W for Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred, respectively.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation: A + B + H + W = 20.

We are also given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, the average age is (A + B + H + W) / 4. We can set up the equation: H = 2 * ((A + B + H + W) / 4).

We know that A = 3 and B = 4. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20, which simplifies to H + W = 13.

Now, we can substitute H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4) into the equation H + W = 13. This gives us: 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4) + W = 13.

Simplifying the equation, we get: (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2 + W = 13. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 7 + H + W + 2W = 26.

Combine like terms: H + 3W = 19.

Now we have two equations: H + W = 13 and H + 3W = 19. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: 2W = 6.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that W = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we must first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected. This can be found by adding the initial $500 collected from his neighbors to the $1500 collected from the online fund, resulting in a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Since Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, we can calculate the lawyer's contribution by multiplying the total amount collected by 3. This yields 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend will provide $200, which should be subtracted from the total amount collected. The updated total is $2000 - $200 = $1800.

Now, we can calculate the final amount the lawyer will contribute by multiplying the updated total by 3. This gives us 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies available. Since each of the 100 guests brought 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500.

Next, we need to find half of the total number of cookies, which is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 / 15 = 50

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can start by assuming the number of slices for the kids is x and the number of slices for the adults is 2x. Since there are 6 people in total, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Let's denote the size of a kid's slice as y. Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2y.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices, which is 2y + 4(2y) = 2y + 8y = 10y.

Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total size of the adult slices is 2(2y) = 4y.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, divide the size of the adult slices by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(4y / 10y) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the time left for updating records, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

The time spent on inpatient rounds can be found by multiplying the number of inpatients (9) by the time spent per inpatient (20 minutes), which equals 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments by multiplying the number of appointments (10) by the time spent per appointment (30 minutes), resulting in 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of these two values: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available (9 hours) to find the time left for updating records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we must consider the total time required for each step. 

The time needed to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, baking the cake takes 30 minutes, cooling the cake requires 2 hours (120 minutes), and frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. 

First, we convert the cooling time to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Then, we add up all the times: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25, and since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75. For a month, this amounts to $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and with 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15. For a month, this amounts to $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $60 = $360.

To find the expected earnings, we need to consider the number of students and the cost per session. However, the problem does not provide the number of sessions per month. Assuming a typical month has 4 weeks, and the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month is 3 * 4 * 4 = 48 sessions.

The cost per session is $25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (students' lessons) = $26.50. The total expected earnings for the month would be 48 sessions * $26.50 per session = $1,280.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $1,280."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can set up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total is 4x. Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so her total is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x.

x = 64 / 4
x = 56 / 7

x = 16
x = 8

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha. The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to calculate the number of female porcupines and the number of new porcupines born.

First, we find the number of female porcupines by taking 3/5 of the total population: 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. With 30 female porcupines, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines, which is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we can start by identifying the number of blue sticks, which is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks can be calculated as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

Next, we are given that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks can be calculated as:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

For Matteo, the distance traveled is 55 miles/hour x 4 hours = 220 miles.

For Shandy, the distance traveled is 45 miles/hour x 10 hours = 450 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between the two is 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is 230."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into two groups: students over 16 years old and students under 16 years old.

First, we find the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the total students are over 16, we calculate this as 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.

Next, we find the number of male students over 16. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so we calculate this as 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.

Now, we find the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Moving on to the students under 16, we find that half of the total students are under 16, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.

We then find the number of male students under 16 by taking half of the students under 16: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

Finally, we find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is 1875."
"To determine the number of laps each individual can run, we can analyze the given information:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = -6%

However, the charge can't be negative, so let's re-evaluate the calculation for the first 5 hours:
100%"
"To calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total amount she needs to save: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000
2. Calculate her total hourly wage: $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour
3. Calculate the total hours she needs to work to save the down payment: $2,000 / $25 per hour = 80 hours
4. Calculate the number of weeks she needs to work: 80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we subtract the total amount spent on other fruits from his total money: $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this is not possible, as he cannot spend a negative amount. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Jamaar actually spent $10.25, which exceeds his initial $10. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To determine the number of pieces each of Anne's friends received, we must first calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of pieces in the box is 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 900 pieces. 

To find the number of pieces given away, subtract the number of pieces kept from the total: 900 - 120 = 780 pieces.

Now, divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the concept of compound interest. The price increase each year is 5% of the current price.

Year 1: 
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use a simple proportion. We know that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can break down the information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

Next, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

The total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can use the concept of addition. 

Let's break down the information given:

- On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
- On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
- On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, or 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To determine the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of the total questions in the quiz. 

40% of 60 is equivalent to 0.4 * 60 = 24.

Since the remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we can find the number of each type by subtracting the number of easy questions from the total and dividing by 2.

60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions: 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as y. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 3x * y, and the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2y = 8y. We can set up the equation:

3x * y + 8y = 120

Since the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, we can substitute 3x with 3 * 4 = 12. Now the equation becomes:

12y + 8y = 120

Combine like terms:

20y = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

y = 6

Since y represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2y, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. 

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family per day by adding the individual daily consumption of the man, his wife, and their son. 

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Next, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total earnings from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

The total earnings from cookies can be found by multiplying the number of cookies sold (80) by the price per cookie ($1), resulting in 80 * $1 = $80. 

Next, we calculate the total earnings from cupcakes by multiplying the number of cupcakes sold (60) by the price per cupcake ($4), yielding 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, we add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne then gave her two sisters $10 each, totaling $20. To find her remaining earnings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by the twins. Since there are two twins, each finding 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Next, we need to subtract the number of eggs that were not found by the friends from the total number of eggs. The problem states that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Therefore, the number of eggs not found by the friends is 10.

Now, we can calculate the number of eggs found by the friends by subtracting the number of eggs not found by the friends from the total number of eggs: 100 - 10 = 90.

However, we must also account for the eggs found by the twins, as they are not part of the friends. Therefore, the correct calculation is 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we must first establish the daily ore production rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. 

We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day. Consequently, with a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a month, which is 30. Therefore, the total amount of ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a ratio of price to quantity for the first two packages. 

The ratio of price to quantity for the first package is $3 / 2 sandwiches.
The ratio of price to quantity for the second package is $6 / 4 sandwiches.

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

(3 / 2) = (x / 8)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 8 = 2x
24 = 2x
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount owed after Tom uses the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After selling his old bedroom for $1000, Tom has $2000 remaining.

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to consider the changes in the number of balloons at each stage.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10. Therefore, 10 red balloons burst.

The remaining red balloons are 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released when Sally was startled. Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released.

The remaining yellow balloons are 12 - 6 = 6.

Sally then found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6. Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we sum the remaining red, yellow, and added blue balloons: 15 + 6 + 6 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can use the concept of complementary probability. This involves finding the probability of the event not occurring and subtracting it from 1.

Let's break down the problem into its components:

1. The probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% (or 0.5) * 60% (or 0.6) = 0.3
2. The probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% (or 0.5) * 40% (or 0.4) = 0.2
3. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in: 50% (or 0.5) * 20% (or 0.2) = 0.1

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.6

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

The final answer is 40%."
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we must first calculate the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty. 

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we can find the remaining seats available for distribution among the graduates.

Total seats taken = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We also know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2(75) = 150.

Furthermore, we are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = 3M = 3(150) = 450.

Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 450.

The final answer is 450."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we must first determine her total daily income and then subtract her daily expenses. 

Her daily income is $15, and her daily expenses are $3. Therefore, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she worked for 6 hours a day for 3 days, the total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find her total jury pay, we multiply her daily income after expenses by the total hours worked: $12 * 18 = $216.

Now, we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing her total jury pay by the total hours worked: $216 ÷ 18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Ted, we need to find the sum of the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each can be calculated as 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each can be calculated as 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ted is 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway. The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples and then divide it by the number of apples in each pack.

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples.

Next, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school, we can multiply the annual loan amount by the number of years he was in school.

Annual loan amount: $50,000
Number of years in school: 4

Total amount lost = Annual loan amount x Number of years in school
Total amount lost = $50,000 x 4
Total amount lost = $200,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His income tripled after graduating, so we can multiply his pre-college income by 3.

Pre-college income: $25,000
Tripled income: $25,000 x 3
Tripled income = $75,000

Since he worked for 4 years, the total amount of money he earned is:
Tripled income x Number of years worked
$75,000 x 4
$75,000 x 4 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school:
Total amount lost + Total amount earned
$200,000 + $300,000
$500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
Total amount / Tripled income
$500,000 / $75,000
$500,000 / $75,000 = 6.67

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we must first calculate the area of the comforter. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

The area of the fabric can be calculated as follows:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three steps.

First, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. Then, we add 17 to this result, which gives us 85 + 17 = 102 letters delivered on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. Then, we add 5 to this result, which gives us 204 + 5 = 209 letters delivered on Wednesday.

Finally, we add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad can be found by multiplying the number of people who want it (10) by the cost per person ($6.50). This gives us 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is found by multiplying the number of people who want it (6) by the cost per person ($6). This gives us 6 * $6 = $36.

To find the total amount Molly will pay, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To calculate the average amount lost, we need to determine the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as x. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so the amount won is 2x + 1. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so the amount lost is 1.5(2x + 1).

The total amount lost is the sum of the amounts lost in each race: x + 1.5(2x + 1). Simplifying this expression, we get x + 3x + 1.5 = 4.5x + 1.

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: (4.5x + 1) / 3.

However, we are given that he lost $5 in the first race. So, we can substitute x = 5 into the expression: (4.5(5) + 1) / 3 = (22.5 + 1) / 3 = 23.5 / 3 = 7.83.

The average amount lost that day is $7.83."
"To calculate the total population of South America, we can use the fundamental principle of multiplication. 

We have 26 countries, each with 5 cities, and each city has a population of 1000 people. To find the total population, we multiply these numbers together.

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country: 26 * 5 = 130.

Next, we multiply the result by the population of each city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000.

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet 3 inches, which can be converted to inches as follows: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

The first person's share is $586.67."
"To determine the total hours worked by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since 3/8 of a day is equivalent to 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day, and the team worked for 3 weeks (21 days), we multiply the daily hours by 21 days:
9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. 

We can write the equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^n

where:
A = final value
P = initial value ($20,000)
r = annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21)
n = number of years (3, since we're calculating from 2007 to 2010)

A = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20,000(0.79)^3
A = 20,000(0.631441)
A = 12,688.82

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,688.82.

$12,688.82"
"To determine the number of Spanish books, we can start by finding the total number of non-Spanish books. Since half of the books are written in English, we can calculate this as 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

Next, we know that 10% of the books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is the sum of English and German books, which is 25 + 5 = 30 books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of non-Spanish books from the total number of books: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can use the formula:

Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Driven

Given:
Total Distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance Driven = 325 kilometers

Remaining Distance = 1955 - 325
Remaining Distance = 1630 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To calculate the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can use the following steps:

First, we need to find the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we need to convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the total gallons:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 100 people board the train. The net change is -50 + 100 = 50, so the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, decreasing the total to 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is 110."
"To calculate the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to consider the individual costs of each item and apply the relevant discounts.

The tank top costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so the cost of the shorts is $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes are on sale for half price, which means they cost $48 / 2 = $24. Additionally, Alison has a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks, resulting in a final cost of $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we must first calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate the total yearly cost, we first need to find the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120, and the increase is 60% of this amount.

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased monthly cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$192 x 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for the insurance."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we must first calculate the number of loads per week. 

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, which means he needs to wash 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks in the given period, the total number of movies watched is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is 24."
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we know that two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Then, last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. 

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year.

Now, we can find the total number of stickers by adding the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can use a simple division problem. 

We have 720 grams of cat food and 60 grams are fed per day. 

Dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily amount will give us the number of days it will last. 

720 grams ÷ 60 grams per day = 12 days

Therefore, the cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'x'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as 'x + 3'. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia's slices can be represented as '2x'.

We know that the total number of slices is 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 32. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of slices eaten:

x + (x + 3) + 2x = 32

Combine like terms:

4x + 3 = 32

Subtract 3 from both sides:

4x = 29

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 7.25

Since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the total number of slices eaten.

Becky's slices = x + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
Jake's slices = x = 7
Silvia's slices = 2x = 2 * 7 = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting Donovan's part be represented as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200. 

The cost of the visit can be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate ($300) by the number of hours spent (0.5 hours, since the visit is 30 minutes). This results in $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and 30 pills were prescribed. Therefore, the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6 per hour, and the doctor spent a minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the total number of emails that require a response and then multiply it by the number of days in the work week.

First, we need to find 20% of the total number of emails James receives in a day. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by the number of days in a work week (5) to find the total number of emails responded to in a week.

64 * 5 = 320

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can break down the information provided:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 * 32 = 64 classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 * 32 = 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

The scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, we add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95

Therefore, the average score is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we must first calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as 's' and the number of big coupons as 'b'. We are given that s = 700 and b = 2s.

The cost of mailing a small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost of mailing a big coupon is 15 cents. Therefore, the total cost of postage can be represented as:

Total Cost = (5 * s) + (15 * b)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total Cost = (5 * 700) + (15 * 2 * 700)
Total Cost = 3500 + 21000
Total Cost = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
Total Cost = 245 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the initial number of sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. Since he ordered 3 less than ten sub sandwiches, we can calculate this as 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, we need to account for the meatballs in the sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, which means we need to subtract 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs from the total.

Now, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, which adds 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs to the total.

The final number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 28 - 16 + 12 = 24.

The final answer is 24."
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Total trucks dispatched = 20
Trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. The number of trucks that delivered is:
20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we must first calculate the total amount of butter required. Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store is currently offering a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs to buy, we divide the total amount of butter he needs (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3.

Since each set costs $4.00, and Dennis needs 3 sets, the total cost will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then apply the rental fee. 

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come.

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 2x. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of x, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of x. The total amount they spent is 1/4x + 1/3x. We can set up the equation:

2x - (1/4x + 1/3x) = 60

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 1/4 and 1/3, which is 12. We can rewrite the equation as:

2x - (3/12x + 4/12x) = 60
2x - 7/12x = 60

Combine like terms:

(24/12x - 7/12x) = 60
17/12x = 60

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the fraction:

17x = 720

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 720 / 17
x = 42.35 (round to two decimal places)

Since x represents the initial amount of money they had, we can find the total amount of money they had by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 42.35
2x = 84.70

Now, we can find the total amount of money they spent:

Total amount spent = 1/4x + 1/3x
= (3/12x + 4/12x)
= 7/12x
= 7/12 * 42.35
= 30.12

To find the amount of money they have left, we subtract the total amount they spent from the total amount they had:

Amount left = 2x - Total amount spent
= 84.70 - 30.12
= 54.58

The two of them have $54.58 left."
"To determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey, we must first calculate the total weekly consumption of the first two monkeys. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and since there are 7 days in a week, the first monkey's weekly consumption is 10 * 7 = 70 bananas.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey's daily consumption is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas. The second monkey's weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 bananas.

The combined weekly consumption of the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the remaining bananas for the third monkey to eat in a week is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the number of pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750."
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 each = $30
Since she bought a dozen (12) roses for $15, we can also calculate the cost of the remaining 3 roses:
3 roses * $2 each = $6
Total cost of roses = $30 + $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the change:
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equal to 5 * $5 = $25
Total amount of money she has = $25
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, she will not have enough money to buy the roses. However, we can calculate the change if she had enough money:
Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses = $25 - $36 = -$11 (she is short $11)

Since she is short $11, we need to find out how many quarters she can get with $11:
$11 / $0.25 (quarter) = 44 quarters

However, since she is short $11, she will not have enough quarters to cover the cost of the roses."
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price and then add the results together.

First, we'll calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 6 * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we'll calculate the total sales from burger platters: 9 * $11 = $99.

Then, we'll calculate the total sales from sodas: 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Finally, we'll add the total sales from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

Let's break down the train schedule:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after 60 minutes, or 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can use a simple division problem. 

First, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks, we can multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the original price of the watch, we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can set up the equation:

Sale price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Sale price = $3200

To find the percentage discount, we can find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide by the original price.

Discount = Original price - Sale price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = -20%

Since the sale price is higher than the original price, we can say that Mr. Rogers' friend paid 20% more than the original price.

Final answer: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to determine the rate at which a single spring creates jellyfish. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, its hourly rate is 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

To find the total number of jellyfish created by a single spring in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by 4: 60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 240 jellyfish.

Now, we can find the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours by multiplying the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by 5: 240 jellyfish * 5 = 1200 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the given information that his score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. Let's denote Binkie's score as x. Then, Frankie's score can be represented as 2x + 15.

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 90

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 90 - 15
2x = 75

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

Now that we know Binkie's score, we can find Frankie's score by substituting x into the equation 2x + 15:

Frankie's score = 2(37.5) + 15
Frankie's score = 75 + 15
Frankie's score = 90

The final answer is 90."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we must consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

The total distance James walked is 4 miles (to the store and back home). Since he walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of both options.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, we can multiply the number of bananas by the cost per banana. 

Number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas
Total cost of individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. The cost per bunch is $3.00, and Jenny buys 10 bunches.

Total cost of bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually.

Amount saved = Total cost of individual bananas - Total cost of bunches
Amount saved = $32.00 - $30.00
Amount saved = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as x. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find the amount left over for Sam by subtracting the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of unit rates. 

First, we establish the rate of growth per year by dividing the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year.

Next, we multiply this rate by the desired number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can analyze the situation by considering the rate at which the farmer and the truck operate.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. Since they work simultaneously, we can find the net change in the number of bales per hour by subtracting the number of bales collected from the number of bales produced: 5 - 3 = 2 bales per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period by multiplying the net change per hour by the number of hours: 2 * 6 = 12 bales.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

**The final answer is 12.**"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class. 

He attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Additionally, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. To find this amount, we calculate 1/16 of 1000 minutes: 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

The total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday is 62.5 minutes. Adding this to the total minutes he spends in class, we get 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. Therefore, 1062.5 minutes is equal to 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6883 hours.

The final answer is 17.69."
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we must first calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. 

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, so we multiply 72 by 2/3 to find the height after the first bounce: 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can break down the information step by step.

First, we know the first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert this to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so their height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so their height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so their height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we can use the formula: Total Earnings = Total Apples Sold * Price per Bag.

Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can first find the total number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Total Bags Sold = Total Apples Sold / Apples per Bag
Total Bags Sold = 2000 / 10
Total Bags Sold = 200

Now, we can multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total Earnings = Total Bags Sold * Price per Bag
Total Earnings = 200 * $5
Total Earnings = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we can work backwards. 

Let's denote the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate as ""x"". The velociraptors then consumed half of this amount, which is x/2. The Allosaurus consumed the remaining half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4. We know that the Allosaurus consumed 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 + 540 = 1620 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1620}$"
"To determine the total area of the walls, we must calculate the area of each wall and add them together. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, 3 sodas were shaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, 2 shaken sodas remained. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if the shaken soda is the one left. 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 1 out of the total number of sodas left, which is 1 (shaken soda) + 9 (unshaken sodas) = 10.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (1) by the total number of outcomes (10) and multiply by 100:

(1/10) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, we can add their individual distances traveled to find the total distance between them.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 and the speed of the second train as v2. We are given that v1 = 60 miles per hour and v2 = v1/2 = 30 miles per hour.

The time elapsed is given as t = 3 hours. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can calculate the distance traveled by each train:

Distance traveled by the first train = v1 × t = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled by the second train = v2 × t = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled:
Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles."
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we must first calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. 

20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we round down to 6 days off.

Billy is available to volunteer for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to volunteer by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is 150."
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we must consider the capacity of both the buses and the cars. 

First, we calculate the total number of people in the buses. Since each bus can carry 35 people and there are 12 buses, the total number of people in the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the total number of people in the cars. Each car can carry 3 people, and there are 20 cars. Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars: 420 + 60 = 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can use the information provided. 

First, we know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. This means Martha's age can be calculated as 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Next, we are told that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age can be found by adding 10 to Martha's age: 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.
For the second biggest slide, the time is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can start by finding the distance run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
= 3.5 * 8
= 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total to find Ahito's distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, we calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, we calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
$15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be:
$85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00
$70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which implies that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish.

Solving for x, we multiply both sides by 15 to get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To determine Caroline's age, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given the following relationships:

1. C = 4
2. B = 2C
3. A = 3B

Substituting the value of C into the second equation, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Now, substituting the value of B into the third equation, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work, we can calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. She plans to live on 40% of her income, which is $40,000 per year. 

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the amount she saves as a percentage of her income.

$20,000 / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20% of her income.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will save the same amount each year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for 20 years, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

However, we need to know how much she needs to save for 20 years. Assuming she wants to save the same amount each year, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need 20 years to save $400,000.

However, this is the amount she needs to save, not the amount she needs to work for. To find the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year.

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for the same amount of time to earn the same amount.

Since she saves 20% of her income, she will need to work for 20 years to save $400,000.

Final Answer: The final answer is 20."
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This yields 25 cm per part. 

Next, we take the length of each part (25 cm) and divide it by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This results in 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can use the following equation:

0.4x = 240

where x represents the total number of students. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600, and the number of girls is 360."
"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the soil is $26. Adding these two amounts together gives us $19 + $26 = $45. 

Since the discount is $7, we subtract this from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

We have two groups of heels: 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. 

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.

The total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of women, which is 6.

18 / 6 = 3

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find the difference between the required miles per day and the miles she is currently planning to hike.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{185}$"
"To determine the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

The cost of red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.
The cost of blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.
The cost of green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

The total amount received is the sum of these individual costs: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we first need to calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is 1/4 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as 12 / 4 = 3 kg.

Paul's share is 1/3 of 12 kg, which can be calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially was 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques can be found by subtracting the total amount taken from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply a simple addition operation. 

The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, which means we subtract 8 from the initial temperature. 

Temperature after the drop = Initial temperature - 8
= 2 - 8
= -6 degrees Celsius

Finally, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. 

Temperature in the morning = Temperature after the drop + 3
= -6 + 3
= -3 degrees Celsius

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is -3."
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we add the initial amount of money Raymond had to the amount he saved from his allowance: $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book from the total: $32 - $5 = $27.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the puzzle from the result: $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is $8."
"To determine the cost of each book, we can start by finding the total amount spent on the books. Since Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Now, we know that she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. To find the cost of each book, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$10 / 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the concept of percentage increase. 

First, we need to find 20% of the original number of students, which is 50. 

20% of 50 is calculated as 0.20 x 50 = 10.

Next, we add the increase in enrollment to the original number of students: 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the concept of rate and proportion. 

First, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. 

Time = Number of blinks / Rate = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fish, we must first calculate the total number of each type of fish.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquired 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6.
The total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.
The total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5.
The total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11.
The total number of female fish is 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, we subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we can analyze the information provided.

Let's denote the time taken by Amalia as A, Megan as M, and Dior as D. We know that:

A = 4 hours (time taken by Amalia to mow the lawn)

M = A + 2 (time taken by Megan to walk the dog, which is 2 hours longer than Amalia)

D = A + 4 + 4 (time taken by Dior to do laundry, which is over 4 hours longer than Amalia)

Substituting the value of A into the equations for M and D, we get:

M = 4 + 2 = 6 hours
D = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 hours

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
A + M + D = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 hours

Therefore, the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 22 hours."
"To determine the total distance driven in a month, we must first calculate the round-trip distance. The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can set up a proportion based on the information provided. Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can express this relationship as:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance
10 * 7 = 2x
70 = 2x

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 70 / 2
x = 35

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400. We can set up the equation:

2 * 6 * 10 + 2 * 4 * 10 + x * 10 = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120 + 80 + 10x = 400

Combine like terms:

200 + 10x = 400

Subtract 200 from both sides:

10x = 200

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 20

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can break it down into two parts. 

First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs. Since Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can calculate its weight by dividing Kory's dog weight by 4. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, so Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards to determine the initial number of stickers Seth had.

We know that Kris had 16 stickers after receiving 7 from Rob and keeping 9. This means Kris initially had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 23 stickers, Luis must have had 23 + 7 = 30 stickers initially.

As Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 30 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 30 = 60 stickers initially.

Therefore, the initial number of stickers Seth had is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces. 

Next, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags.

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total distance / Daily distance

Given that the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers and Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

Number of days = 40,000 km / 400 km
= 100

Therefore, it will take Alfie 100 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 100."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can break down the information into a series of steps.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Next, we are told that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Lastly, we are informed that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25. This gives us 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Since Liam's age is twice Vince's age two years ago, we can set up the equation:

Liam's current age = 2 * (Vince's current age - 2)

We know Liam is 16 years old now, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

16 = 2 * (x - 2)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

8 = x - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate x:

x = 10

Therefore, Vince's current age is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M, and C + S = 30. Additionally, we are given that C = S + 12.

We can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can substitute the value of C and S into the equation A + M + C + S = 56. This gives us A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight of the crayons by 16:

Total weight of crayons = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the total length of wood that can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs from 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we determine the number of logs that can be made from this length. Each log is 4 feet, so we divide the total length by 4.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, we find the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5, as each log is cut into 5 planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John's total earnings are $96."
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then sum them up.

Valerie's salary is given as $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's salary by multiplying Valerie's salary by 2. This gives us $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x'. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, we can set up the following equations:

Time on the beach = Distance / Speed = 2 / x
Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 / (2x)

We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

2 / x = 40 / 60
2 / x = 2 / 3
x = 3

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = 1 / (2x) = 1 / (2 * 3) = 1 / 6 = 0.1667 hours
Converting this to minutes, we get:
Time on the sidewalk = 0.1667 * 60 = 10 minutes

Now we can find the total time:
Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of unit price and division.

First, we need to find the total amount she has already saved, which is the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Next, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find the number of additional weeks:
$28 ÷ $4/week = $28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can use the concept of addition. We have three groups of trees with different numbers of blue birds.

First, we'll calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 7 blue birds each. Since there are 3 trees, we multiply 7 by 3 to get 21 blue birds.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 4 blue birds each. There are 2 trees, so we multiply 4 by 2 to get 8 blue birds.

Lastly, we'll add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles initially, we can find out how many marbles he will have after losing 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we can start by considering the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. Since he is able to drink the water, the total amount of water is 5 ounces.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as x degrees. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the total amount of water is 5 ounces:

4 + 1 = 5

However, this equation doesn't provide any information about the temperature. We need to consider the average temperature of the water. Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 >= 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x >= 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

x >= 47

Since x represents the temperature of the water in the second mug, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cows and the number of chickens.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

Each day, 20 cows are added from Milkie Cows Limited, and 10 chickens are added from Broilers Limited. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

The total number of cows added in 21 days is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. 

The total number of chickens added in 21 days is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The total number of cows after 3 weeks is 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows.

The total number of chickens after 3 weeks is 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each bagel after the discount, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is:

Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 10% of the total cost:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Russell pays:

Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel:

Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

Therefore, the cost of each bagel after the discount is $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we establish the relationship between scoops and potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means that 3 scoops require 3 potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we subtract 3 from 3, which equals 0 scoops per potato. However, this is not a practical or logical solution, so we re-evaluate the initial statement. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem's wording. 

Assuming the intention was to state that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can rephrase it as: 6 - 3 = 3 scoops, and 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. This implies that 3 scoops require 3 potatoes.

Now, we are told that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we subtract 5 from 23, which equals 18 scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate for 18 scoops. Since 3 scoops require 3 potatoes, we divide 18 scoops by 3 to find the number of scoops per potato, which equals 6 scoops per potato. Then, we multiply 18 scoops by 3 potatoes to find the total number of potatoes Gomer ate, which equals 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester's egg consumption can be calculated as 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

For the next 30 days, his egg consumption increases to 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in 60 days is the sum of these two values: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. 

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can start by finding the total number of non-blue jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 x 17 = 34.

Now, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since the total number of jellybeans is 60, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we can use the formula:

Total lemons = Number of trees × Number of lemons per tree × Number of years

Given:
Number of trees = 5
Number of lemons per tree = 6
Number of years = 10

Total lemons = 5 × 6 × 10
Total lemons = 300

Therefore, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is 300."
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

5/9 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5 * 84 = 9x
420 = 9x

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

x = 420 / 9
x = 46.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 46.67 to 46 (as you can't have 0.67 of a person). 

Now, we know that the number of men is 5x = 5 * 46 = 230, which is not possible since the total number of passengers is 84. This indicates that the initial assumption of 5x = 84 is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the ratio of men to women is 5:9. We can set up an equation using the total number of parts in the ratio (5 + 9 = 14) and the total number of passengers:

(5/14) * 84 = number of men
(9/14) * 84 = number of women

Simplifying, we get:

30 = number of men
54 = number of women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we must first calculate the number of bouquets sold. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7.

As Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is 7 * 3 = 21.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold is 21 * 12 = 252.

The final answer is: $\boxed{252}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Next, we need to find 60% of 100, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60. This represents the number of rocks he sells. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount he earns is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money he loses by subtracting the total earnings from the total cost: $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80."
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 5, 6, and 7 is 210. 

Now, we can divide the total number of each type of scene by the LCM to find the number of days required for each type of scene:

45 large-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.2143 (round up to 1 day, since we can't have a fraction of a day)
36 medium-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.1714 (round up to 1 day)
49 small-sized picture scenes / 210 days = 0.2336 (round up to 1 day)

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up the number of days for each type of scene. However, we can see that the LCM is not the correct answer. We need to find the maximum number of days required for any type of scene.

The maximum number of days required is 9 days for large-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we must divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

There are 4 children. 

To find the number of eggs each child receives, we divide 36 by 4, which equals 9 eggs per child.

The correct answer is 9."
"To calculate the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we must first determine the number of days in the month. May has 31 days.

Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily cost to find the total monthly expenditure for one fish. 

31 days * $1/day = $31

As Jen has 3 fish, we then multiply the result by 3 to account for all of them.

$31 * 3 = $93

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia has, we must consider the sequence of events that have transpired.

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She then gave 24 roses to her mother, resulting in a reduction of 24 roses. This leaves her with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.

Subsequently, Patricia acquired 15 more roses, bringing her total to 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Therefore, Patricia now possesses 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial distance and the additional distance, which is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial time and the additional time, which is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is then calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seashells each person collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as y. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can express the number of seashells Carlos collected as 2y.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as:

2y + 5 = 27

Solving for y, we get:

2y = 22
y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells, and Carlos collected 2y = 2(11) = 22 seashells.

The total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To divide the seashells equally among the three people, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can break down his carrot consumption into two parts: weekdays and weekends.

Mason consumes 4 carrots per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On the weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots per day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:
60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit is $120."
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We are given that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Given that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height can be calculated as 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first calculate the total energy demand.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, the total energy demand for 2300 people is:

2300 * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = -3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, indicating that Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, the number of additional bottles needed is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers) 
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75
= 75%

The final answer is 75."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday as M, T, W, Th, and F, respectively. We know that:

M + T = 1907
Th + F = 2136
M + T + W + Th + F = 5168

We can solve for W by subtracting the sum of the reports received on Monday and Thursday from the total number of reports received last week:

M + T + Th + F = 5168
(M + T) + (Th + F) = 5168
1907 + 2136 = 5168 (this equation is true, but we need to find W)

Since the sum of the reports received on Monday and Tuesday is equal to the sum of the reports received on Thursday and Friday, we can set up an equation:

M + T = Th + F

Now, we can rewrite the equation for the total number of reports received last week as:

M + T + W + Th + F = 5168
(M + T) + W + (M + T) = 5168
2(M + T) + W = 5168

Substituting M + T = 1907, we get:

2(1907) + W = 5168
3814 + W = 5168
W = 5168 - 3814
W = 1354

Therefore, the IRS received 1354 reports on Wednesday."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total area of land sold in the first two transactions. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The total area sold in the first two transactions is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we add the earnings from the first two transactions and the earnings from the last sale. The total earnings are $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $60 (from the last sale) = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Haley's age as 'H' and Geb's age as 'G'. We are given that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. This relationship can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are also given that Haley is 26 years old, so H = 26. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the daily usage of face masks. Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:

Daily usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times Tyrion goes out per day
Daily usage = 2 * 3
Daily usage = 6 face masks

Now, to find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total usage every 2 days = Daily usage * 2
Total usage every 2 days = 6 * 2
Total usage every 2 days = 12 face masks

"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up the total number of eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we convert 3 dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to first find the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. 

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last complex is 60% larger than the other two combined, which means it has 1.6 times the number of apartments. Therefore, the last complex has 400 * 1.6 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern of the tree.

The tree produces 50 fruits in the first year. In subsequent years, the production increases as follows:

- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 10 * 50 - 200 = 450 fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree does not produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 450 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 450 = 52500

In the 10th year, the tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 52700

The final answer is 52700."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jack has now, we need to find 1/5 of the initial amount Sophia gave him. 

Since Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of $100 = $100 * 1/5
= $100 * 0.2
= $20

Now, we add this amount to the initial $100 Jack had:

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this relationship as an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express this relationship as another equation:
R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters, which gives us a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money Ronnie has left after giving an equal amount to her sister. 

Let's denote the amount Ronnie gave to her sister as x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, Rissa received 3x dollars. 

After giving x dollars to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This can be expressed as:

3x - x = (4/5)(3x)

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of each color of paint as 'x'. Since there are four colors in total, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'. We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of yellow paint is 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 6.

However, this equation doesn't account for the other three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can express the total amount of paint used as 3x + 6 = 12.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 6.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 square feet (bedroom) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To calculate the total number of clouds Alice counted across the week, we can utilize a simple yet effective approach. We'll start by identifying the initial number of clouds on Monday and then apply a geometric progression to account for the doubling of clouds each subsequent day.

The number of clouds on Monday is 3. Since the number of clouds doubles each day, we can express this as a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the series
- a is the initial term (3 in this case)
- r is the common ratio (2 in this case)
- n is the number of terms (5 in this case, representing the 5 days)

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted across the week is 93."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box, we first need to calculate the cost of one pod. The cost of the regular box is $12 for 100 pods, so the cost of one pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12.

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which means it contains 120 pods. To find the cost of one pod in the new box, we can divide the cost of the new box by the number of pods it contains: $12 / 120 = $0.10 per pod.

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the amount of money available by the cost of one pod: $1 / $0.10 = 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He then loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, Thomas triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as A1 and the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as B1. We know that A1 = 4. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, we can express B1 as B1 = A1 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which can be expressed as A2 = (1/4) * B1. We know that B1 = 2, so A2 = (1/4) * 2 = 0.5.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so B2 = 4 * B1 = 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Total goals scored by team A = A1 + A2 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5
Total goals scored by team B = B1 + B2 = 2 + 8 = 10

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams: 4.5 + 10 = 14.5"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can set up an equation based on the rate at which he uses the chalk.

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as 5 inches. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can express the remaining chalk after 'x' days as:

Remaining chalk = 5 - 0.20x

The teacher recycles the chalk when the remaining length is less than 2 inches. Therefore, we can set up the inequality:

5 - 0.20x < 2

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

-0.20x < -3

Dividing both sides by -0.20 and reversing the inequality sign:

x > 15

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's calculate the number of days:

Day 1: 5 - 0.20(5) = 4 inches
Day 2: 4 - 0.20(4) = 3.2 inches
Day 3: 3.2 - 0.20(3.2) = 2.56 inches
Day 4: 2.56 - 0.20(2.56) = 2.048 inches
Day 5: 2.048 - 0.20(2.048) = 1.6384 inches
Day 6: 1.6384 - 0.20(1.6384) = 1.31872 inches
Day 7: 1.31872 - 0.20(1.31872) = 1.06064 inches
Day 8: 1.06064 - 0.20(1.06064) = 0.840512 inches
Day 9: 0.840512 - 0.20(0.840512) = 0.6720256 inches
Day 10: 0.6720256 - 0.20(0.6720256) = 0.53750128 inches

"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we must first calculate the number of students on varsity. 

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of the total number of girls, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of the total number of boys, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, thrice that amount would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we add 2 to this result to find the total number of face masks Johnny bought. Therefore, 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and divide it by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than the number drilled, which means the dentist caps 11 teeth. 

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15

Total number of teeth James has = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased. 

First, we'll find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:

(2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C. 

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000. 

We know that 100 books cost $500. To find the number of sets, we can divide the total amount by the cost of one set:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since Bob has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school can get:

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

As each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books each school can get:

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Newton has 2 apples.

1. He picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree. This results in 5 additional apples falling out, bringing the total to 2 + 5 = 7 apples.
2. He then puts 6 apples in his pocket and throws 1 back into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This brings the total to 7 + 6 = 13 apples.
3. Finally, he picks up all the remaining apples and goes home.

Therefore, Newton brings home 13 apples.

The final answer is 13."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost = Total weight of coal * Cost per unit
= 850 kg * $18/kg
= $15,300

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $15,300."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each friend consumes. Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

With 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.

To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, we divide 60 by 12, which equals 5. To find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, we divide 60 by 8, which equals 7.5.

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0. The sum of this sequence can be calculated as: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. This also forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0. The sum of this sequence can be calculated as: 5 + 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we can find the total miles by adding the sum of both sequences: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine Jim's age, we can use a simple division operation. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age

We are given that John's current age is 28. We can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's age

To solve for Jim's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can use a simple addition problem. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2 slices.

We know that the total number of slices is 8. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 8

Combine like terms:

3x + 3 = 8

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

Since x represents the number of slices Doxa ate, we can calculate the number of slices each person ate:

Doxa: x = 5/3
Sister: x + 1 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3
Brother: x + 2 = 5/3 + 2 = 11/3

To find the total number of slices eaten, we can add the number of slices each person ate:

Total slices eaten = 5/3 + 8/3 + 11/3 = 24/3 = 8

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 63.

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

Final answer: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the length of her hair and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her hourly rate and attendance. 

First, we calculate her total hours worked in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, the total hours worked can be found by multiplying these values: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours.

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate by multiplying the total hours worked by her hourly rate of $1.5: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Additionally, since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an extra $10. Therefore, her total earnings can be found by adding this amount to her total earnings from her hourly rate: $270 + $10 = $280.

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to consider the amount he earned from each activity and then sum them up.

Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

For the dishwasher, he emptied it 6 times, so the total amount earned from this activity is 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

He also did his laundry once, which earned him $3.00.

Additionally, he took the trash out twice, resulting in 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.

Lastly, he cleaned his room once, earning him $1.50.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

Therefore, Jason's total earnings in a two-week period are $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To calculate the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first determine the amount of blood a single shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can find the amount of blood a shark has by multiplying 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct groups and sum their quantities.

First, we have the initial 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, bringing the total to 50 + 40 = 90.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290.

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the number of red pens, so it is 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

Let's start by determining the number of trees planted on each day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the quantity.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then, on the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, resulting in 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining. The next day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. Finally, on the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, leaving 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

To find the amount each person received, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve the equation 4x + 8 = 40, we can isolate the variable x by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66 / 3 = 22. This represents the number of fish with red stripes.

Next, we calculate the number of remaining fish by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total: 66 - 22 = 44.

Then, we find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which is 5/11 * 44 = 20. This represents the number of fish with blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes: 22 + 20 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to break down the information provided.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, adding 3 * 6 = 18 colors to her collection.

Combining these, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister then stole one palette containing 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Lastly, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Therefore, Amy now has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second floor. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 - 252 = 168

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To determine the number of miles the last dog needs, we must first calculate the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, we divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. 8 / 4 = 2.

Therefore, the last dog needs 2 miles per day.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be found by multiplying the house's value by 0.4.

House value: $250,000
Loan amount: $250,000 * 0.4 = $100,000

Next, we need to calculate the amount used to pay off debts, which is 60% of the loan amount. This can be found by multiplying the loan amount by 0.6.

Loan amount: $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts: $100,000 * 0.6 = $60,000

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the amount leftover.

"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we must first determine the total weight of the tunas caught. This can be achieved by adding the weights of the three tunas: 56 kilograms + 46 kilograms + 26 kilograms = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram: 128 kilograms * $0.50 = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we can use the formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

Given that the selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, we can express this as:

Selling Price = (11/8) * Cost Price

We are told the cost price is $72. Let's calculate the selling price:

Selling Price = (11/8) * 72
Selling Price = 11 * 9
Selling Price = 99

Now, we can find the profit:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

Let's denote the amount of water removed per day at the low setting as L, the medium setting as M, and the high setting as H. We are given that L = 1 liter per day, M = 2L, and H = 2M.

Since M = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation for H: H = 2(2L) = 4L.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water removed at each setting:

Low setting: 3 days * L = 3L
Medium setting: 3 days * M = 3 * 2L = 6L
High setting: 5 days * H = 5 * 4L = 20L

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3L + 6L + 20L = 29L

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

The final answer is 29."
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's break it down:

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons
Number of balloons left = 12

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x. Since Saanvi combines 14 mL of this medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is 3x.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the amounts of the two medicines: x + 3x = 4x.

We are given that the total amount of the first medicine in one dose is 14 mL, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 14.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 14/4 = 3.5.

Now that we know the amount of the first medicine in one dose, we can find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses by multiplying the amount in one dose by 8: 3.5 x 8 = 28.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 28 mL.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to calculate the capacity of John's school. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate John's class capacity as follows:

1/8 * 120 = 15 students per class

As John has two classes, his total capacity is:

2 * 15 = 30 students

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacities of Ali's and John's schools:

120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial amount borrowed. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount paid in 11 months + Interest
= $275 + $6
= $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can use a simple division problem. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, we can calculate the total number of diaper changes as follows:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can divide the total number of diaper changes by 2 to find out how many diapers Jordan changes:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the volume of the jar. Given its square base and height, the volume can be calculated as:

Volume = base area * height
= (6 inches * 6 inches) * 15 inches
= 360 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the packing efficiency:

Total jelly beans = 360 cubic inches / 0.8
= 450 jelly beans

As 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3:

Number of red jelly beans = 450 * 0.3
= 135 jelly beans

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

Difference = 900 - 135
= 765 jelly beans

Therefore, Tim's estimate was 765 jelly beans short of the true number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This is equivalent to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing 60, the total becomes 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to consider the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $19 on all her visits to the museum."
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"

The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated as 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of these two amounts, which is $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we must first calculate the total pounds of meat required to produce 80 meatballs. Since each pound yields 16 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Next, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound, which is 2 tablespoons.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must first calculate the total width of the windows. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we can break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * 0.25 = $4.00.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * 0.20 = $4.00.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.

Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'x'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, so we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to find the combined price of both services. 

The basic manicure starts at $35, and the basic pedicure starts at $40. Therefore, the combined price without any discounts is $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we need to calculate the discount for getting both services. The discount is 20% of the total price, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

Let's denote the number of issues the last magazine sends as 6x, since it sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. Therefore, 6x = 6 * 4 = 24 issues per year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines: 
- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year.
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues per year.

The total number of issues is 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of paintings each person has.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as x.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the price increase in December. The toy was initially $40, and it increased by 80%. This means the increase amount is 80% of $40, which is 0.8 * $40 = $32. Adding this increase to the initial price, we get $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. The price in December is $72, and it decreased by 50%. This means the decrease amount is 50% of $72, which is 0.5 * $72 = $36. Subtracting this decrease from the price in December, we get $72 - $36 = $36.

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount earned from the standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25%, which is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount earned from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we can find the total amount Charlie will make for the day by adding the amount earned from the standard lessons and the amount earned from the lessons with veterans: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The total score is 630.

There are 9 scores. To find the mean, we divide the total score by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we calculate the number of apples Walter ate, which is 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Next, we find the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 apples:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Then, we calculate 25% of the remaining apples, which Walter gave to his sister:
25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

Now, we find the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Walter received by selling the remaining 27 apples at $3 each:
27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of novels written this year as x.

We know that 3 quarters of x is equal to 9, so we can write the equation:

(3/4)x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100

Given that the total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km and Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, we can calculate the total time taken for the journey.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 6000 km / 50 km/hr
Time = 120 hours

Since Michael is traveling for 3 days, we can convert the days to hours:
3 days = 3 x 24 hours = 72 hours

However, this is not the total time taken for the journey. We need to consider the actual time taken, which is 72 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance covered:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the total distance covered:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can start by calculating the total number of grapes used by the family. 

Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, who ate 6 grapes. So, he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. The total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we add the total grapes used by the family to the grapes used by the mother: 84 + 48 = 132 grapes.

Therefore, there were 132 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we can use the principle of addition. We are given two groups of teachers: those who were sick and those who were present.

"To calculate the total yearly cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to consider the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese. The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and the cheddar cheese costs $3.00. The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of the cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost can be calculated by adding the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is the weekly cost multiplied by 52 weeks: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning. This can be found by multiplying the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100: (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the custodian spends 25% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first establish the capacity of each shelf. We know that the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:
110 / 45 = 2.44

To accommodate all the books, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Number of dozens * Cost per dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40
Total cost = $12

Next, let's find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 * $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $60 - $12
Profit = $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.

Next, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.

Then, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the minimum number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she must answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as follows:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Now, we can find 70% of the total questions:
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct

Since Audrey has already answered 60% of the first test questions correctly, we need to find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test. We can do this by subtracting the number of questions she has already answered correctly from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:
77 (total correct) - 42 (correct on the first test) = 35 questions correct needed on the second test

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to pass."
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of strawberry cubes be represented by a variable, x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can express the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

x = 20

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the expression 5x - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can use the formula for total points scored, which is the product of the number of games played per year, the number of years, and the number of points scored per game.

Let's break it down:

Number of games played per year = 40
Number of years = 4
Number of points scored per game = 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Number of points scored per game
Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points scored = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can break down the events as follows:

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He lost half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This leaves him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Finally, he discarded a non-marble, which doesn't affect the count of marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to establish the conversion rates between telephone calls, potential customers, and actual customers. We know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 potential customer, and for every 2 potential customers, 1 car is sold.

Let's define the conversion rates as follows:

- Telephone calls to potential customers: 25 calls / 1 potential customer
- Potential customers to actual customers: 2 potential customers / 1 actual customer
- Actual customers to cars sold: 1 actual customer / 1 car

To find the number of telephone calls needed to get 15 cars, we can use the conversion rates to calculate the number of potential customers required, and then the number of telephone calls needed to generate those potential customers.

First, we calculate the number of potential customers needed to get 15 cars:
15 cars / 1 car / 2 potential customers = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers

Next, we calculate the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 potential customers:
30 potential customers / 1 potential customer / 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the information into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, the total number of flashlights is 4 x 2 = 8.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. The house has 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 x 4 = 16.
The total number of medium candles is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles: 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the number of chips each person receives, we must first calculate the total number of chips. Since Mitchell purchases two bags, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find the number of chips each person receives.

110 ÷ 5 = 22

Therefore, each person receives 22 chips.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual steps and calculate the time for each step.

Let's denote the time it takes to solve the first side as 'x'. Since the second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, their time can be represented as 2x. The last two sides, which take half as long as the first side, can be represented as x/2.

We know that once the fifth side is solved, all 6 sides are solved. Therefore, the total time can be represented as the sum of the time for the first four sides and the time for the fifth side.

The equation can be written as: x + 2x + 2x + (x/2) + (x/2) = total time

Combine like terms: 6x + x = total time
Combine like terms again: 7x = total time

Since we know that the first side takes 5 minutes, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:
7 * 5 = total time
35 = total time

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 35 minutes.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we can start by finding the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up the equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Next, we can find the number of robots, which is half the number of helmets:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Finally, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can calculate the number of calls he makes per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a workweek.

First, we need to find out how many calls he deals with in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can divide 60 by 15 to find the number of calls per hour.

60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 4 calls per hour

Next, we multiply the number of calls per hour by the number of hours he works per day to find the total number of calls per day.

4 calls per hour * 6 hours per day = 24 calls per day

Finally, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days in a workweek (5 days) to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three categories based on the amount of water each group of plants requires.

First, we have 4 plants that need half a cup of water. This can be calculated as 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that require 1 cup of water each, resulting in a total of 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

Lastly, we have 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water, which can be calculated as 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water needed, we add the water required for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we must consider the time spent hopping on land and the time spent swimming through the water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time for each segment separately.

The total distance is 200 yards, with 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. 

The time taken to cover the land distance is 100 yards divided by the land speed of 20 yards per minute, which equals 5 minutes. 

The time taken to cover the water distance is 100 yards divided by the water speed of 10 yards per minute, which equals 10 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of the land and water times, which is 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can use division to find out how many boxes he needs to purchase. 

Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can divide the total number of sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8) to find the number of boxes needed:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now that we know Bob needs 7 boxes, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box ($2.00) to find the total cost:

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can break it down into two components: the main phone and the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of these phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the main phone and the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we need to first determine the total number of doughnuts he sells in the month. Since he produces 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, we can calculate the daily production as 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.

With 30 days in June, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Given that each doughnut is sold at $2, we can find Derrick's total earnings by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut: 3600 * 2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are $7200."
"To determine the number of days required to upload all the photos, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Therefore, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To determine the total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning, we can calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00.

Then, we'll calculate the cost of the skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00.

Now, we'll add the costs together: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

The final answer is: $47"
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to determine his new speaking speed. Since his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, we can find his new speed by multiplying the original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so the total number of words in 10 pages is:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM by dividing the total number of words by the speed:

Time = Total words / Speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that on the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, resulting in 70 people. Then, on the third day, the total number of people doubled to 140.

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these four days, we can multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of kernels popped, we can break down the problem into distinct intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped in each interval.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. This establishes the initial rate of popping.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases three times the initial rate, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

The popping rate then increases to four times the initial rate in the subsequent 30 seconds, yielding 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, resulting in 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels popped, we sum the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from residual heat. This quarter is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels popped is the sum of the kernels popped in each interval and the additional kernels from residual heat: 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is 210."
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first establish the lemon-to-cup ratio. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 cup as follows:

6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Next, we calculate the total number of cups required for 5 gallons of lemonade:
1 gallon = 4 cups
5 gallons = 5 * 4 cups = 20 cups

Since Tim also wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of cups required for this extra gallon:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of cups needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
6 lemons / 2 cups = 3 lemons for the extra gallon

To find the total number of lemons required, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
20 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 120 lemons for the 5 gallons
3 lemons for the extra gallon
Total lemons = 120 lemons + 3 lemons = 123 lemons

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required for a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption of both breeds. 

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 3 dogs. Therefore, the total daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms of dog food per day, and there are 2 dogs. Therefore, the total daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

To find the total daily consumption, we add the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can use the following approach:

First, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal. Since there are 10 two-legged animals, each contributing 2 legs, the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Similarly, the 15 four-legged animals contribute 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Next, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2, as each pair consists of 2 legs. Therefore, 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can start by establishing the ratio of blue to yellow blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, the ratio of yellow to blue blocks is 2:1. This means that for every 1 blue block, there are 2 yellow blocks.

Given that there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20."
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance traveled west and the distance traveled east.

Since Elvis was driving at an average speed of 18 miles per hour for both parts of the journey, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 8 hours = 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can use the formula for depreciation:

Value after depreciation = Initial value * (1 - Depreciation rate)

For the first year, the depreciation rate is 30%, so the value after the first year is:

Value after Year 1 = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

For the second year, the depreciation rate is again 30%, so the value after the second year is:

Value after Year 2 = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

For the third year, the depreciation rate is 20%, so the value after the third year is:

Value after Year 3 = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we must first establish the quantities of the other colors. We know that the bag contains 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of non-pink candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to determine the cost of the bus trips first. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.

10% of $80 = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is:
$80 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $136

The final answer is: $136"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple subtraction approach. Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as 'x'. Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas initially received 25 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 52

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

x = 52 - 25
x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets can be determined by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost of an adult ticket, and then adding the cost of a child ticket. In this case, the calculation is as follows:

2 adult tickets * $12 = $24
$24 + $8 (child ticket) = $32

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost of each popcorn:

2 popcorns * $3 = $6

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:

$32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the total length of crepe paper needed, we must calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James will need 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can use the formula for average: (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2.

Given that Mia is 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the sum of the seashells found by each individual. 

Let's add the seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total. There were 67 cracked seashells.

The number of good seashells is then calculated as follows: 732 - 67 = 665.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665."

"To determine the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to calculate half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to it.

Steve's time = 10 hours

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Anna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption. 

We know that each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. Since there are 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount eaten from the total amount ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week."
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be:
6 * 2 = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40. Additionally, she earns $40 from selling 40 cookies at $1 each. Therefore, her total income is $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses. Frances purchases 5 trays at $4 each, resulting in a total cost of 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can calculate the total number of meals she has already given out and subtract that from the total number of meals.

First, we need to find the sum of the meals given out on each day: 64 + 30 + 48 = 142.

Therefore, James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 12 by 2.

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of the brothers are 12 and 24. We also know the ages of the sisters are all 16.

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 

12 + 24 + (3 * 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break it down into two components: daily time and weekly time.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours.

She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
3.5 hours + 5 hours = 8.5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8.5}$"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric needed for the quilt, we can calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

The area of a small shirt is 3 square feet, and there are 11 of them. So, the total area of small shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

The area of a medium shirt is 4 square feet, and there are 8 of them. So, the total area of medium shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

The area of a large shirt is 6 square feet, and there are 6 of them. So, the total area of large shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt:

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information. We know that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. This can be expressed as an equation: Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens.

Given that George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we are told that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find the number of pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we can work backwards from the given information. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, making her 2 x 36"" = 72"". Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, her height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Given that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can find her height before the summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height. Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to break down the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine Ryan's total earnings, we can multiply his weekly allowance by the number of weeks he completed his chores. 

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. 

6 * 3 = 18

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Since Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, the total number of cones is 4. Each cone costs $1.25. 

4 * 1.25 = 5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings to find out how much money he has left.

"To determine the profit made from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing 10 jars. 

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit per jar is 2 * $6 = $12. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $12 = $120. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit per jar is 1.5 * $8 = $12. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $12 = $120. 

The cost of 2 pounds of honey per jar is 2 * $10 = $20. For 10 jars, this amounts to 10 * $20 = $200. 

The total cost of producing 10 jars is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

Since each jar is sold for $50, the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. 

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin to its equivalent value in dollars and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

2. Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

3. To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

4. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we can start by determining the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. We start by adding the quantities of rainbow and oatmeal cookies, then subtract this sum from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, we calculate the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
Rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow and oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so T = 16. We also know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 8. However, this is an error in the problem statement, as it should be T = 16. We will proceed with the correct value of T.

We are also given that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16. However, we are told that Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes, which is correct. We will proceed with the correct value of P.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 16 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: B = 29 - 16 - 16.

Solving for B, we get: B = 29 - 32.

B = -3.

However, the number of beakers cannot be negative, so we need to re-examine the problem. Let's re-evaluate the information given.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 8. We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 16. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get: B = 29 - 8 - 16.

B = 5.

Since Igor had 7 beakers requested, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed can be found by multiplying the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Let's calculate the total number of screws required:

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply add the number of eggs in each basket. 

The first basket contains 10 eggs, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs, which is 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we can start by calculating the individual amounts raised by each person.

Let's denote Alexandra's amount as A, Kim's amount as K, Maryam's amount as M, and Sarah's amount as S.

We are given the following information:
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so K = A + $320.
- Alexandra raises $430, so A = $430.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so M = S + $400.
- Sarah raises $300, so S = $300.

We can substitute the value of A into the equation for K: K = $430 + $320 = $750.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for M: M = $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can add the amounts together: A + K + M + S = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can set up an equation to find Aaron's distance. Let's denote Aaron's distance as 'd'. Then, we have:

d = 4 / 2
d = 2 miles

Now, we know Aaron's distance and time. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find Aaron's time.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 / x
Time = 16 minutes

To find Aaron's speed, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 2 / 16
x = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time. Since Vanessa's speed is 'x/2', we can substitute the value of 'x' to find her speed:

Vanessa's speed = (1/8) / 2
Vanessa's speed = 1/16 miles per minute

To find Vanessa's time, we can multiply her distance by her speed:

Time = Distance * Speed
Time = 4 * (1/16)
Time = 4/16
Time = 1/4
Time = 0.25 hours
Time = 15 minutes

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can start by calculating the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply 200 by 3 to find the total length of line required.

200 * 3 = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to consider the number of reservations, meal prices, and the cost of the wine.

First, let's calculate the total revenue generated from meals per day. With 6 reservations and 2 meals per reservation, the total number of meals is 6 * 2 = 12. Each meal costs $5, so the total revenue from meals is 12 * $5 = $60. Additionally, they order a $5 bottle of wine per day, bringing the total daily revenue to $60 + $5 = $65.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by 2. Therefore, the weekly revenue is $65 * 2 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the formula for calculating the selling price with a given profit percentage.

Let's denote the cost price per watermelon as C and the selling price per watermelon as S. We know that the total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write:

50C = 80

To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide both sides by 50:

C = 80 / 50
C = 1.60

Now, we can use the formula for calculating the selling price with a given profit percentage:

S = C + (C * Profit Percentage)

In this case, the profit percentage is 25%, or 0.25. So, we can plug in the values:

S = 1.60 + (1.60 * 0.25)
S = 1.60 + 0.40
S = 2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son James when he was 19. To find John's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since James was born to John's age at the time of James' birth. Since James is now 18, 18 years have passed. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

Now, we need to find the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we subtract the number of years that have passed since his birth from John's current age. Since John is 37, 37 - 32 = 5 years have passed. Therefore, John's youngest son is 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. 

Since they start at the same time, we can assume that they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute. 

Let's say they peel x oranges in the first minute. 

In the second minute, Ana will peel x - 1 oranges, and Jane will peel x oranges.

We can continue this pattern, and we can see that Ana will peel x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Jane will peel x, x, x, x, and so on, oranges in each subsequent minute.

Since they peel the same number of oranges in the first minute, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane will be the same in each subsequent minute.

Let's calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Ana will peel x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + ... + 1 oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of 1, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + 1)
Sum = 30 * (x + 1)

Jane will peel x + x + x + ... + x oranges in 60 minutes.
This is an arithmetic series with a first term of x, a last term of x, and 60 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)
Sum = (60/2) * (x + x)
Sum = 30 * 2x
Sum = 60x

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is the difference between the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Ana and the sum of the number of oranges peeled by Jane.

Difference = 30 * (x + 1) - 60x
= 30x + 30 - 60x
= -30x + 30

Since x is the number of oranges peeled in the first minute, x must be a positive integer. 

However, the difference -30x + 30 is negative for all positive values of x. This means that Ana will peel fewer oranges than Jane after an hour.

But we are asked to find how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, so the answer is 0.

Final Answer: The final answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the discounted price of the radiator and add the labor cost.

The original price of the radiator is $400. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. This gives us another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70
2(x + y) = 40
-------------------
2x + 4y - (2x + 4y) = 70 - 40
0 = 30

This is not possible, so we need to re-examine our equations. Let's re-evaluate the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70

We can divide both sides by 2 to simplify:

x + 2y = 35

Now we have a new equation. We can use the first equation to express y in terms of x:

y = 20 - x

Substituting this into the new equation, we get:

x + 2(20 - x) = 35
x + 40 - 2x = 35
-x = -5
x = 5

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = 20 - x
y = 20 - 5
y = 15

So, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is 14."
