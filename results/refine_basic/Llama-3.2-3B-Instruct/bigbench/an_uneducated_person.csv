"Let's figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

We know the flutist lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. So, the person with the vase of tulips can't live in house 2, 'cause the flutist lives there. That means the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. That means the person with the bouquet of lilies can't live in house 1, 'cause the person with the vase of tulips lives there. So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 3.

There's one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. That means the pianist lives in house 4.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: person with the vase of tulips
- House 2: flutist
- House 3: person with the bouquet of lilies
- House 4: pianist

The person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1."
"Let's figure out where the cellist lives.

We know the person who likes green lives in the first house. And the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house too. So, the first house is taken by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis.

The person who likes blue and has a gameboy lives next to each other. They can't live in the first house 'cause that's taken. So, they must live in the second or third house. But there's one house between the cellist and the person who has a gameboy. That means the cellist can't live in the second house. So, the cellist must live in the third house.

The person who has a television lives to the left of the root beer lover. The first house is taken by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis. The second house is taken by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy. So, the person who has a television must live in the first house. But we already know that's taken. This means the person who has a television must live in the first house is wrong. The person who has a television must live in the second house.

The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the root beer lover. The first house is taken by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis. The second house is taken by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. But we already know that's taken. This means the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

The root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. The second house is taken by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy. The third house is taken by the person who only drinks water. So, the root beer lover must live in the first house. But we already know that's taken. This means the root beer lover must live in the first house is wrong. The root beer lover must live in the second house.

The percussionist doesn't live in the second house. The second house is taken by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy. So, the percussionist must live in the first house. But we already know that's taken. This means the percussionist must live in the third house.

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: Percussionist (eating kiwis), drinking water, playing guitar, has a television
- House 2: Person who likes blue, drinking coffee, playing cello, has a gameboy
- House 3: Person who likes green, eating oranges, drinking root beer, playing percussion

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 5, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the fifth house (clue 15), the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

We know the person who is eating apples lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating apples lives in house 1, the person who is eating mangos must live in house 2.

The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. So, the person who had pizza must live in house 2 or 3. But we already know the person who is eating mangos lives in house 2, so the person who had pizza must live in house 3.

The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house. That's house number 3.

The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. The person who is eating mangos lives in house 2, so the person who is eating grapes must live in house 4.

The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. The person who drives a truck lives in house 1, so the person who owns an SUV must live in house 2.

The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. The person who drives a truck lives in house 1, so the tea drinker must live in house 2.

The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who ate spaghetti must live in house 4, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 3 or 4. But we already know the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 4.

The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. We don't know who owns the convertible yet, but we know the person who drives a truck lives in house 1, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker, who lives in house 2. So, the person who drives a convertible must live in house 1.

The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. The person who drives a truck lives in house 1, so the tea drinker must live in house 2.

The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4, so the coffee drinker must live in house 3.

Now we have a problem. We know the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in house 3. But we also know the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in house 3. This is a contradiction.

Wait, I made a mistake. The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in house 3. But we also know the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in house 3. This is not a contradiction. The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. That's clue 1.

We also know the person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house. That's clue 2.

The root beer lover lives right next to the person who had stew. That's clue 3.

The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. That's clue 4.

The coffee drinker lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti. That's clue 5.

The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. That's clue 6.

The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live right next to each other. That's clue 7.

So, the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house. The root beer lover lives in the third house, and the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, and the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

Now, we gotta figure out who's in the first house. We know the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. That means the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. The only person left for the first house is the person who had pizza, and the only person left for the second house is the coffee drinker.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Let's think about this thing. We got 3 houses and 3 people. Each person plays a diffrent sport, eats diffrent fruit, and has diffrent flowers. 

Clue 1 says the soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges. That means the soccer player can't live in house 2 or 3, 'cause then the oranges would be to the left of the soccer player. So the soccer player must live in house 1.

Clue 2 says the swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other. That means they can't live in house 1, 'cause the soccer player lives there. So they must live in house 2 or 3. But clue 4 says the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges. That means the person with daffodils can't live in house 2, 'cause the oranges live there. So the swimmer and the person with daffodils must live in house 3.

Clue 3 says the person with tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos. That means the person eating mangos can't live in house 3, 'cause the swimmer and the person with daffodils live there. So the person eating mangos must live in house 1.

Now we got the soccer player in house 1, the person eating oranges in house 2, and the swimmer and the person with daffodils in house 3. The only one left is the person eating bananas, and they must live in house 2. But that can't be, 'cause the oranges live in house 2. So the person eating bananas must live in house 1, and the person eating mangos must live in house 2.

So the person with daffodils lives in house 3. The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person with the tulips lives.

We know the violinist lives in the first house. Then, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist. So, the first house is the violinist, the second house is the person with the daffodils, and the third house is the percussionist.

The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist, so they live in the third house. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live next to each other. Since the percussionist lives in the third house, the person with the tulips and the phone must live in the second house. But we already know the person with the daffodils lives in the second house, so the person with the tulips and the phone must be the percussionist. That's not possible, so we need to swap the person with the tulips and the phone. The person with the tulips must live in the second house, and the person with the phone must live in the third house.

Now we have the arrangement: 
- House 1: violinist
- House 2: person with the tulips
- House 3: person with the phone, percussionist, and fried rice eater

The person with the tulips lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

We know the bird keeper doesn't live in the first house (clue 1). The mystery book reader lives in the second house (clue 2). The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house (clue 3).

The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (clue 4). Since the mystery book reader lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer (clue 5). Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the percussionist must live in the second house.

The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the first house (clue 6). The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet (clue 7). Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house.

The cellist doesn't live in the third house (clue 8). Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house and the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, the cellist must live in the second house.

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: History book buff (has a bouquet of lilies) 
- House 2: Celist (has a computer) 
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (has a rose bouquet)

The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, so the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person with the phone lives.

We know the person with horses lives in the third house. The person with horses lives to the left of the person who eats grapes. So, the person with grapes lives in the fourth house.

The person with a radio and the person with carnations live next to each other. They can't live in the first house because the person with horses lives there. They can't live in the fifth house because the person with bananas lives there. So, they live in the second and fourth houses, in that order.

The person with a radio lives to the left of the person with carnations, so the person with a radio lives in the second house. The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.

The person with a bouquet of daffodils can't live in the first house. The person with bananas lives in the fifth house, and there's one house between the banana eater and the person with carnations. So, the person with bananas lives in the second house, and the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house.

The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person with a bouquet of roses lives to the left of the person with a gameboy. The person with a bouquet of roses lives in the third house, and the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of roses. So, the person with a gameboy lives in the second house.

The person with a computer can't live in the fifth house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, so the person with a computer lives in the first house.

The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person with a bouquet of roses lives in the third house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, and the person with bananas lives in the second house. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person with a bouquet of roses lives in the third house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, and the person with bananas lives in the second house. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person with a bouquet of roses lives in the third house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, and the person with bananas lives in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

1. Computer - Fish enthusiast - Gameboy - Bouquet of roses - Banana
2. Cat lover - Bouquet of daffodils - Bouquet of lilies - Carnations arrangement - Radio
3. Horse owner - Bouquet of roses - 
4. Fish enthusiast - Carnations arrangement - Orange - Bouquet of lilies
5. Banana eater - Bouquet of daffodils - Phone

The person with the phone lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's one person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- They're all wearin' different shoes: one's wearin' sandals and one's wearin' boots
- They all like different kinds of books: one likes mystery books and one likes history books
- They all drive different cars: one drives a convertible and one drives a truck

Now, here's what I figured out:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives right next to the person who likes history books.
   - That means the person who likes history books can't live in house number 1, 'cause the person who drives a convertible lives in house number 1.

2. The person who's wearin' boots don't live in house number 1.
   - That means the person who's wearin' boots lives in house number 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The person who likes history books lives in house number 2.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in house number 1.
- The person who's wearin' boots lives in house number 2.

Since the person who's wearin' sandals can't be the history book person (cause they live in house number 2), and the person who's wearin' boots lives in house number 2, the person who's wearin' sandals must live in house number 1.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"So, there's this thing with four houses and four people. Each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

We know the golfer lives in the first house. That's Clue 5.

Now, the swimmer lives right next to the romance book lover. But the swimmer can't live in the third house, so the swimmer must live in the second house.

The mystery book reader lives right next to the history book buff. But the mystery book reader can't live in the first house 'cause that's the golfer. So, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

So, we got this: 
- Golfer (1)
- Swimmer (2)
- Mystery book reader (3)
- ? (4)

The basketball player can't live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first house. No, wait, that's the golfer. The basketball player can't live in the second house 'cause that's the swimmer. The basketball player can't live in the third house 'cause that's the mystery book reader. So, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

So, the answer is (C) 4."
"Let's figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person wearin' high heels don't live in the second house.
2. The history buff lives to the right of the person wearin' loafers.
3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. The person wearin' high heels don't live in the fourth house.
5. The person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover.

From clue 5, we know the person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover. So, the order is:
- Sandals
- Romance
- ?

We don't know what's in the second house yet.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the order is now:
- Sandals
- ? 
- Mystery
- ?

From clue 2, we know the history buff lives to the right of the person wearin' loafers. We don't know what's in the second house yet, but we know the history buff can't be in the second house 'cause the person wearin' high heels can't be in the second house (clue 1).

From clue 4, we know the person wearin' high heels don't live in the fourth house. This is good, 'cause we already figured out the history buff lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about clue 1 again. The person wearin' high heels can't be in the second house, and the history buff can't be in the second house. That means the person wearin' high heels must be in the first house, and the history buff must be in the fourth house.

So, the order is:
- High heels
- ? 
- Sandals
- History

We still don't know what's in the first house. But we know the person wearin' high heels can't be in the second house, and the history buff can't be in the second house. That means the person wearin' high heels must be in the first house, and the history buff must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover. So, the order is:
- High heels
- Sandals
- Romance
- History

Now we know the order, and the mystery book reader lives in the third house. The answer is (B) 3."
"I figgered out the puzzle. There's 3 houses, and each one's got a person in it. They all got different stuff: one's got a phone, one's got a computer, and one's got a gameboy. And they all like different colors: one likes yellow, one likes blue, and one likes green.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives right next to the person who's got a gameboy. Clue 2 says the person who's got a gameboy lives right next to the person who's got a computer. Clue 3 says the person who likes yellow can't live in the second house.

So, if the person who likes green lives right next to the gameboy, and the gameboy's right next to the computer, that means the person who likes green lives right next to the first house. And since the person who likes yellow can't live in the second house, that means the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

So, the order is: 
- Yellow (1st house)
- Green (2nd house)
- Gameboy (3rd house)
- Computer (4th house)

The person who has a computer lives in house 3. The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We got some clues:

7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker don't live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know there's two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker can't be in the first or last house.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. This means the coffee drinker can't be in the first or second house.

From clue 3, we know the history book buff don't live in the fourth house. This means the history book buff can be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 4, we know the romance book lover don't live in the first house. This means the romance book lover can be in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover is already in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the mystery book reader don't live in the fourth house. This means the mystery book reader can be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the person who likes red is already in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff are in the second and third houses, in that order.

From clue 9, we know the tea drinker don't live in the second house. This means the tea drinker can be in the first, third, or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:

1. The tea drinker can't be in the second house, and the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the tea drinker must be in the first house, and the romance book lover and history book buff must be in the second and third houses, in that order.

So, the correct order is:
1. Tea drinker
2. Romance book lover
3. History book buff
4. ? (we still need to find the person who likes white)

From clue 1, we know there's two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"I think I figured it out. There's a person in house 1 and a person in house 2. The person in house 1 likes green and reads fantasy books. The person in house 2 likes yellow and reads mystery books. The person in house 1 had pizza, and the person in house 2 had spaghetti. The person in house 1 has a cat, and the person in house 2 has a fish.

The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who has a radio must be in house 2.

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1, the person who likes green is also in house 1.

The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house. So, the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

The person who had pizza does not live in the first house. So, the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (likes green, has a cat) and the person who had spaghetti
- House 2: Fish enthusiast (has a fish, had pizza)

So, the cat lover lives in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

We know the dog owner lives in the second house. The person who likes red lives in the third house, and the dog owner and the person who likes red live next to each other. So, the order is: ?, dog owner, ?, red, ?, ?.

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who likes blue. So, the order is: ?, ?, dog owner, ?, milk, blue.

The person who owns horses lives in the first house, and the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. The person who had stew doesn't live in the third house, so the order is: horse owner, ?, dog owner, ?, milk, blue.

The bird keeper lives to the left of the history book buff, and there's one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live next to each other, and there are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives. So, the order is: horse owner, ?, bird keeper, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,

"Let's figure out where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

We know the cat lover lives in the first house. And the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the cat lover and the person who is eating kiwis live in the first house.

The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the fish enthusiast must live in the second house.

The person who owns horses lives directly next to the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. The person who is eating oranges must live in the third house.

The person who is eating apples lives in the second house.

The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: cat lover (eating kiwis)
- House 2: bird keeper (drinking tea), eating apples
- House 3: fish enthusiast (owning horses), eating oranges
- House 4: person who only drinks water, likes milk, guitarist

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We know that the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the rose bouquet is in house 1.

The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house, so the vase of tulips is in either house 2 or 3. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, so the grilled cheese is in house 4.

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, so the pizza is in house 3.

The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other, so the stew is in house 5.

The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement, so the carnations arrangement is in house 1.

The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis, and there are two houses between them, so the kiwis are in house 2.

The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos, so the apples are in house 3.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house, so the daffodils are in house 4.

Now, let's put it all together:

House 1: Carnations arrangement, oranges
House 2: Vase of tulips, kiwis
House 3: Daffodils, apples, pizza
House 4: Grilled cheese, daffodils
House 5: Stew

The person who had stew lives in house 5."
"Let's figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner.
2. The person with daffodils can't live in the second house.
3. There's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations.
4. The person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house.

Clue 1 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person with daffodils can't live in the second house. This means they can live in the first, third, or fourth house.

Clue 3 says there's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations. This means the horse owner and the person with carnations can't live in the first and third houses, 'cause there ain't no house in between.

Clue 4 says the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. This means the horse owner must live in the second house, and the person with lilies must live in the fourth house.

If the person with lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person with daffodils lives in the third house, that means the person with carnations must live in the second house. But we already know the horse owner lives in the second house. That don't make sense either.

Let me think... If the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner, and the cat lover lives in the first house, that means the person with tulips must live in the first house. But we already know the cat lover lives in the first house. That don't make sense.

The person"
"I'm gonna try to figure this out.

So, there's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. They got different people in each house. They got different shoes, different pets, and different devices. 

Clue 1 says the person with the phone lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

Clue 2 says the person with boots can't live in the second house. That means the person with boots lives in house number 1.

Clue 3 says the person with horses and the person with a radio live right next to each other. Since the person with the phone lives in house number 1 and the person with boots lives in house number 1, the person with horses and the person with a radio must live in house number 1 too.

So, house number 1 got:
- Phone
- Boots
- Horses
- Radio

That leaves house number 2 for the person with high heels and the dog owner.

So, the person with high heels lives in house number 2. The answer is (A) 2."

That means they can't be in the third house, 'cause that's where the person who had pizza lives. And the person who had pizza can't live in the second house, 'cause that's where the person who is wearing boots lives. So, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer must live in the first house.

Clue 2 says the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the third house. Clue 1 already told us that, so we know that's true.

Clue 3 says the person who is eating apples can't live in the first house. Clue 8 says the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who is eating apples must live in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, so the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house. But we already know that the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, so the person who is eating grapes can't live there. This means the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house, but that's where the person who is wearing boots lives. This is a problem.

Wait, let's go back to Clue 1. We know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. We also know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. So, the person who has a computer must live in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now, let's look at Clue 5. It says there's one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. The person who has a phone lives in the third house, so the person who likes blue must live in the first or second house. But we already know the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Clue 6 says the person who is wearing loafers can't live in the third house. We already know the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

Clue 7 says the person who had pizza can't live in the second house. Clue 8 says the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house. But we already know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, so the person who is eating mangos can't live there. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house, but that's where the person who is wearing boots lives. This is a problem.

Wait, let's go back to Clue 1. We know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. We also know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. So, the person who has a computer must live in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Clue 9 says the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other. We already know the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

Clue 10 says the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. We already know the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:

- The person who likes blue lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
- The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
- The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
- The person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

So, there's a row of houses with 4 people in 'em. Each person plays a diffrent sport and has a diffrent pet. We gotta use clues to find out where the bird keeper lives.

Now, we gotta figure out the order of the first three houses. Clue 6 says the tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover. Clue 2 says the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player don't live in the first house, the order for the first three houses is: 
- The tennis player lives in the first house.
- The cat lover lives in the second house.
- The basketball player lives in the third house.

Now, we gotta figure out the last house. Clue 4 says the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Clue 5 says the bird keeper don't live in the first house. Clue 7 says the bird keeper don't live in the third house. Since the bird keeper lives in the last house, and the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner, the order for the last house is: 
- The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
- The fish enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
- The bird keeper lives in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 4."

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives in the last house. That's house 3.

Clue 2 says there's one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue. That means the baseball player can't live in the first house, and the person who likes blue can't live in the last house. So, the baseball player lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the last house. But we know the soccer player lives in the last house, so the person who likes blue can't live there. That means the baseball player lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

Clue 3 says the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, and the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house.

Clue 4 says the swimmer lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV. The person who owns an SUV lives in the second house, so the swimmer lives in the third house.

Clue 5 says the violinist doesn't live in the first house. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, so the violinist lives in the second house.

Clue 6 says the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, so the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house.

Clue 7 says the guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white. The person who likes white lives in the third house, so the guitarist lives in the second house.

Now we got:

- House 1: Baseball player (owns a sedan, has a gameboy)

- House 3: Soccer player (owns an SUV, likes blue)

The soccer player lives in house 3. The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. 

We also know that the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must live in the second and third houses.

The cat lover lives in the third house. So, the person who has a phone must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

The person who has a computer lives left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who has a computer must live in the first house.

The person who owns horses lives left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a computer lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the second house.

The bird keeper lives left of the person who has a television. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the fourth house.

The bird keeper lives left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house.

The person who had stew lives right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.

The person who had stew lives left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fifth house.

So, the order is: 
1. Grilled cheese
2. Phone
3. Cat lover
4. Stew
5. Fried rice

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, which is option (E) 1."

So, the person with a radio and the pianist must live in the first two houses. But the pianist can't live in the first house, so the person with a radio must live in the first house and the pianist in the second house.

- The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other, and the person wearing high heels lives next to the pianist. So, the percussionist must live in the third house.

- The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots, and the person wearing boots lives in the third house. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house.

- The person eating oranges lives to the left of the person who has a television, and the person eating kiwis lives in the second house. So, the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:

"Let's think about this. There's a row of three houses, and three people. Each person ate somethin' different for lunch: spaghetti, stew, and fried rice. Each person plays a different sport: swimmin', cricketer, and tennis.

Clue 1 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. Clue 2 says the person who ate spaghetti lives right next to the person who ate fried rice. Clue 3 says the swimmer lives in the first house. Clue 4 says the cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3. The person who ate spaghetti lives right next to the person who ate fried rice, so they live in house 2. The swimmer lives in the first house, so they can't be the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, we gotta figure out who's who. The cricketer can't live in the third house, so they gotta live in either house 1 or 2. But the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, so the cricketer must live in house 1.

So, the swimmer lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and the cricketer lives in house 1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2."

"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. That means the person who is wearing high heels can't be in the third house, 'cause the person who likes blue lives in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the first house. Clue 3 says the history book buff lives in the second house. Clue 4 says the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the third house. Clue 5 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Clue 6 says the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. Clue 7 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. Clue 8 says the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives next to them. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels can't live in the third house. That means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house and is wearing boots.
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person who likes blue lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house, and the person who likes blue lives in the first house, so the person who likes green must be in the second house.

So, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives.

We know from clue 1 that the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, we know the person wearin' runnin' shoes and the person wearin' boots live next to each other. They can't be in the first and second houses 'cause the person wearin' runnin' shoes is already in the first house. They can't be in the third and fourth houses 'cause the person ownin' an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, they must be in the second and third houses.

Clue 3 says the person drivin' a minivan lives next to the person wearin' high heels. Since the person wearin' runnin' shoes is in the first house, the person wearin' high heels must be in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person wearin' sandals lives next to the person drivin' a convertible. Since the person wearin' high heels is in the third house, the person wearin' sandals must be in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person ownin' a sedan don't live in the third house. Since the person wearin' high heels is in the third house, the person ownin' a sedan must live in the first or fourth house. But the person wearin' runnin' shoes is in the first house, so the person ownin' a sedan must live in the fourth house.

Clue 6 says the person ownin' an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Now we got the order: 
- House 1: Person wearin' runnin' shoes
- House 2: Person wearin' sandals
- House 3: Person wearin' high heels
- House 4: Person ownin' a sedan and an SUV
- House 5: Person wearin' boots

The person wearin' boots must be in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"I think I figured it out. There's a cricketer in the first house, and they own horses. That means the person who owns horses lives in house 1. Then, there's a cat lover in the second house. The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan, so the sedan owner can't be in house 2. That means the sedan owner has to be in house 3. 

Now, the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player. The cat lover is in house 2, and the sedan owner is in house 3. That means the truck driver has to be in house 1. But that's the cricketer's house! So, the truck driver can't be in house 1. 

The only place left for the truck driver is house 2, but that's the cat lover's house. So, the truck driver has to be in house 3. But that's the sedan owner's house! That's a problem. Wait, I think I made a mistake. The truck driver can't be in house 3 because the sedan owner is in house 3.

"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. Then, the person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. So, the person eating apples lives in the second house. The person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person eating apples is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the person driving a convertible must be in the third house.

Now, there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the coffee drinker must be in the third house. The person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. But that's where the coffee drinker lives. Wait, that can't be right.

Let's try again. The tea drinker lives in the first house. The person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan, so the person eating apples lives in the second house. The person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person eating apples is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the person driving a convertible must be in the third house.

Now, there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the coffee drinker must be in the third house. But the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. That means the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 3."

Clue 3 says the person who likes white can't live in the third house. That means they can live in the first or second house. But clue 4 says the person who likes red lives in the second house. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

Now, clue 2 says the fantasy book enthusiast can't live in the first house. That means they must live in the third house. So, the order is: white, ?, red, mystery, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

"Let's figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

We know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. We also know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, and the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.

The cat lover doesn't live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who owns an SUV, so they must live in either the first or the second house.

The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.

6. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Clue 1 says the person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker can't live in the second house (clue 3), the person who has a television must live in the first house.

Clue 4 says the person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who has a television lives in the first house, the guitarist must live in the second house.

Clue 5 says there's one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the guitarist lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house, and the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the coffee drinker must live in the second house, but that's already taken by the guitarist. However, since the person who is eating kiwis lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

Clue 6 says the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a radio lives in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house, but that's taken by the guitarist. However, since the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person who has a radio, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house, but that's taken by the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house is incorrect, and the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

Clue 3 says the tea drinker does not live in the second house. Since the person who has a television lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the third house.

Now we got the following arrangement:
- House 1: person who has a television, coffee drinker, person who has a vase of tulips
- House 2: guitarist, person who has a rose bouquet
- House 3: person who is eating a banana, person who is eating kiwis, person who is eating apples, tea drinker

The person who is eating apples doesn't live in the third house, and the person who is eating mangos lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who is eating apples. This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the first house.

"I think I got it. So, there's this one house that's number 1, and the person who likes mystery books lives there. That's house number 1. Now, we gotta figure out who lives in house number 2. The clue says the tennis player doesn't live in house number 1, so they must live in house number 2. 

Now, we gotta think about the other clues. We know the person who likes fantasy books can't live in house number 1 (that's taken), and they can't live in house number 2 (that's where the tennis player lives). So, the only house left is house number 1. But wait, we already know the mystery book person lives in house number 1. That means the fantasy book person must live in house number 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes white lives.

We got a bunch of clues, but I'm gonna try to make sense of 'em.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. That's cool, but we don't know who's wearin' sandals or who ate spaghetti yet.

Clue 2 says the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That's good, but we still don't know who's eatin' what.

Clue 3 says the person who has a rose bouquet doesn't live in the first house. That's a good clue, but we don't know who's got the rose bouquet yet.

Clue 4 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. That's a good one, but we don't know who's wearin' what shoes or who's got the daffodils yet.

Clue 5 says the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. That's a good clue, but we don't know who's eatin' pizza or who's got the daffodils yet.

Clue 6 says the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. That's a good one, but we don't know who's wearin' what shoes yet.

Clue 9 says there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives. That's a good clue, but we don't know who likes green or who's playin' the piano yet.

Clue 10 says the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. That's a good one, but we don't know who likes green or who's playin' the piano yet.

Clue 11 says the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. That's a good clue, but we don't know who likes blue or who's eatin' pizza yet.

Clue 12 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. That's a good one, but we don't know who's got the lilies or who's playin' the violin yet.

Clue 13 says the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. That's a good clue, but we don't know who's wearin' loafers yet.

Now, let's try to fit the people into the houses.

We know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. That's a good start.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies is the person who likes white. The person who likes white lives in the third house.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. The person who is wearing running shoes is the person who had pizza. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils is the person who likes yellow. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. The person who likes green lives in the first house. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.

The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who is wearing sandals is the person who had stew. The person who had stew lives in the first house. The person who had stew is the person who likes green. The person who likes green lives in the first house.

Now, we have the following order: 
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who likes white lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to solve this puzzle thingy.

From Clue 4, we know the cellist lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know the basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the basketball player must live in the second house.

From Clue 6, we know the flutist lives to the right of the person who wears boots. Since the person who wears boots lives in the third house, the flutist must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the flutist lives in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

From Clue 8, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the person who wears running shoes. Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the person who wears running shoes must live in the first house. But we already know the cellist lives in the first house, so the person who wears running shoes must be the root beer lover.

From Clue 12, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker must live in the fourth house (because the flutist lives in the fourth house), the person who only drinks water must live in the third house. However, we already know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, so the person who only drinks water must be the person who likes blue.

Now we have the following information:
- The cellist lives in the first house.
- The basketball player lives in the second house.
- The person who wears running shoes lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the third house.

- The flutist lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.

"Let's figure out where the person who likes red lives.

We know from Clue 1 that the person who likes red lives in the first house. But we also know from Clue 7 that the person who is eating grapes lives in the first house. Since they like red, that means the person who likes red is eating grapes.

Now, let's look at Clue 3. It says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red is eating grapes in the first house, the person who likes white must be eating grilled cheese and living in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out.

So, there's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. And there's two people in 'em. One's eatin' grapes and the other's eatin' mangos. They also got different cars and play different sports.

Clue 1 says the grape-eater don't live in the first house. Clue 2 says the baseball player lives in the second house. And Clue 3 says the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

So, the baseball player lives in the second house, and they drive a convertible. That means the grape-eater can't live in the second house, 'cause they don't drive a convertible. That means the grape-eater lives in the first house.

Now, we gotta figure out who's eatin' grapes and who's eatin' mangos. We know the baseball player's eatin' grapes, 'cause they live in the second house and drive a convertible. So, the person eatin' mangos must live in the first house.

So, the person eatin' mangos lives in the first house. That's option B."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes white lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

Now, let's think about clue 3. If the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house, that means the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house. But wait, that's the same house as the person who likes blue! That can't be right.

So, let's think about clue 1. It says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. We don't know who likes green yet, but we know the person who likes blue lives in the first house. If the person who likes blue lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green, that means the person who likes green must live in the first house.

Now we have the order: 
- The person who likes green (1st house)
- The person who likes blue (2nd house)
- The person who is eating kiwis (3rd house)

And clue 4 says the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house. But we already know the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who is eating apples must be the person who likes blue.

Now we have the order: 
- The person who likes green (1st house)
- The person who likes blue (2nd house) and is eating apples
- The person who is eating kiwis (3rd house)

So, the person who likes white lives in the 2nd house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this. There's a house with a rose bouquet, and it's not house 1. If the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2, then the person who likes root beer must live in house 1. 

Now, we gotta think about the soccer player. They gotta live to the left of the mystery book reader. If the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2, then the soccer player can't live in house 2. So, the soccer player must live in house 1. 

The person with the gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the soccer player lives in house 1, the gameboy owner must live in house 1 too. 

So, the order is: 
- House 1: soccer player, gameboy owner, mystery book reader
- House 2: root beer lover, person with the rose bouquet

The person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."

- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow.

Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, and the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who likes milk is in the fourth house. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

But wait, we know the person who likes yellow is in the third house. So, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who likes milk is in the fourth house. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, and the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, the person who likes blue must be in the third house. But we know the person who likes yellow is in the third house. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

Now, let's think about clue 2. The baseball player lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the first house, and the cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the cat lover lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the second house, but this is already taken by the person who likes blue. So, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover lives in the third house, the basketball player must live in the first house, and the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house, but this is already taken by the person who likes blue. So, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house, but this is taken by the cricketer. Therefore, the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house is incorrect, and the cricketer must live in the third house is incorrect. The correct order is: 
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the dog owner lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house, but this is taken by the person who is eating grapes. So, the person who likes green must live in the third house, but this is taken by the cat lover. Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the second house is incorrect, and the person who likes green must live in the third house is incorrect. The correct order is: 
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the first house.
- The dog owner lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house is incorrect, and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house is incorrect. The correct order is: 
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the first house.
- The dog owner lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is not mentioned, we can assume that the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.

- The dog owner lives in the first house.
- The baseball player lives in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the tennis player lives.

We know the person who owns horses lives in the first house (clue 2). The dog owner lives in the fourth house (clue 10). The cricketer lives in the fourth house (clue 13). This means the person who owns horses and the dog owner are the same person, and they live in the first and fourth houses, respectively.

"I think I figured it out. There's a guy in house 1 who plays the guitar, and he's got a computer. Then there's a guy in house 2 who plays the cello, and he's got a Gameboy. The guy with the dog lives in house 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 5, we know the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

Now, let's put the people in the houses:

House 1: Minivan (clue 2)
House 2: Computer (clue 6)
House 3: Gameboy (clue 1)
House 4: Convertible (clue 5)

We gotta figure out where the phone and radio go. Clue 3 says the phone is to the left of the SUV. Clue 4 says the radio is to the right of the gameboy. So, the phone can't be in the third house, and the radio can't be in the first house. The only place left for the phone is the second house, and the only place left for the radio is the fourth house.

Now we got:

House 1: Minivan
House 2: Phone
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

The only person left is the truck. The truck can't be in the first house (clue 2), the third house (clue 5), or the fourth house (clue 4). So, the truck must be in the second house. But we already got the second house for the phone. This means the truck can't be in the second house. The only place left for the truck is the first house.

Now we got:

House 1: Truck
House 2: Phone
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Clue 3 says the phone is to the left of the SUV. So, the SUV must be in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with the carnations lives.

We know the person with tulips lives in the third house. We also know the person with a computer lives in the second house. The person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a carnations arrangement. Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house.

The person with a television lives to the right of the person with a phone. The person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a television. So, the person with a television lives in the third house. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the third house. This means the person with a television can't live in the third house. It has to live in the fourth house.

The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. The person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a television. So, the person with a radio lives in the second house. But we already know the person with a computer lives in the second house. This means the person with a radio can't live in the second house.

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: Rose bouquet, Radio
- House 2: Computer, Television
- House 3: Tulips

- House 5: Daffodils

The person with a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

There's a person in house 1 and a person in house 2. They got different drinks, like root beer and water. One person is eatin' a banana and the other is eatin' grapes. They also had different lunches, like pizza and stew. And they got different cars, like a truck and a minivan. They also got different devices, like a radio and a computer.

Clue 1 says the person with the radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other. That means they can be in either house 1 or house 2. But we don't know which one yet.

Clue 2 says the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. So, if the person with the radio is in house 1, then the person who had pizza can't be in house 1. That means the person with the radio must be in house 1.

Clue 3 says the root beer lover doesn't live in house 1. That means the root beer lover must live in house 2.

Clue 4 says the person who is eatin' grapes lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the person with the radio is in house 1, the person with the computer must be in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1:
  - Person with the radio
  - Person who drives a truck
  - Eating pizza
- House 2:
  - Person who has a computer
  - Eating grapes
  - Root beer lover

"Let's figure out where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

From clue 1, we know the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes milk. From clue 5, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes milk. This means the swimmer and the person who likes milk can't be in the first and second houses, 'cause there's only one house between 'em.

Clue 2 says the person who's eatin' oranges don't live in the third house. Clue 3 says the person who's eatin' mangos don't live in the first house. Clue 11 says the baseball player lives in the fourth house. So, the person who's eatin' oranges gotta live in either the first or the last house, and the person who's eatin' mangos gotta live in either the second or the last house.

Clue 4 says the person who's wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the third house. Clue 7 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who's eatin' kiwis. So, the person who's wearin' runnin' shoes can't be in the first or second house, 'cause there's only one house between 'em.

Clue 8 says the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who's wearin' sandals. Clue 9 says the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who's got a rose bouquet. Clue 18 says the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who's eatin' kiwis. So, the coffee drinker and the person who's wearin' sandals gotta be in the first and second houses, in that order.

Clue 10 says the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Clue 12 says there's one house between where the person who's eatin' grapes lives and where the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils lives. So, the cricketer's gotta be in the third house, and the person who's eatin' grapes gotta be in the fourth house.

Clue 13 says the person who's eatin' mangos don't live in the third house. Clue 14 says the person who's got a vase of tulips lives to the right of the tea drinker. Clue 16 says the swimmer lives directly left of the golfer. So, the tea drinker's gotta be in the second house, and the person who's got a vase of tulips gotta be in the fifth house.

Clue 15 says the person who's wearin' loafers lives in the fourth house. Clue 17 says the person who's got a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who's eatin' grapes. So, the person who's eatin' grapes gotta be in the fifth house, and the person who's got a bouquet of lilies gotta be in the fourth house.

So, the person who's got a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. The answer is (C)."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We got some clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. That means the golfer and basketball player must live in the first and second houses.

Clue 1 says the golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. So, the order is: 
- Golfer (house 1)
- Basketball player (house 2)
- Soccer player (house 3)

Now, clue 2 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the golfer lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house. But we already know the golfer lives in the first house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the golfer. That's not possible, so we need to re-evaluate.

Let's look at clue 4. It says the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now we have two possibilities: 
- Person who has a vase of tulips (house 1)
- Golfer (house 2)
- Basketball player (house 3)
- Soccer player (house 3)

Clue 2 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the golfer lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house. But we already know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the person who has a vase of tulips. That's not possible, so we need to re-evaluate again.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know the person who likes red lives in the third house. That's clue 7. We also know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, but that can't be true because the person who likes red is already in the third house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

We also know the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. That means the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house.

Now, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who had stew lives in the fourth house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house, but that's not true because the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

The person who likes blue lives in the sixth house, and the person who likes green lives in the eighth house.

The person who likes saxophone lives in the ninth house, and the person who likes percussion lives in the tenth house. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist. That means the percussionist lives in the ninth house, and the cellist lives in the tenth house.

The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who had pizza lives in the sixth house.

So, the order of the houses is:
1. person who likes white
2. person who ate spaghetti
3. person who likes red
4. person who had stew
5. person who likes yellow
6. person who had pizza
7. person who likes blue
8. person who likes green
9. person who likes percussion
10. person who likes cellist

The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house."
"Let's figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

We got a bunch of clues, but I'm gonna try to make sense of 'em.

Clue 1 says the tea drinker lives in the third house. That's cool, I guess.

Clue 2 says the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That's a pretty good clue.

Clue 3 says the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Hmm, I don't know what root beer is, but I'll try to remember.

Clue 4 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. I like grilled cheese, but I don't know if I like water.

Clue 5 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. That's a good clue.

Clue 6 says the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. That's a weird clue, but I'll try to remember.

Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. That's good to know.

So, let's start with the tea drinker in the third house (clue 1). We can put the person who had stew to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2). Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5), we can put the person who is wearing running shoes to the left of the tea drinker.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: ? 
- House 2: ?

We know the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (clue 6). Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house (clue 7), we can put the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must live in houses 3 and 4, but since the tea drinker is already in house 3, the person who only drinks water must live in house 4.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: ? 
- House 2: Grilled cheese 
- House 3: Tea drinker 
- House 4: High heels, water 

We know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2). Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5), we can put the person who is wearing running shoes to the left of the tea drinker.

"Let's figure out where the person who has a computer lives.

We know the person who has a radio lives in the third house. That's house number 3.

We also know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. That's house number 3.

The soccer player and the person who has a computer live next to each other. They can't be in the first house because the person who has a radio is in the third house. They can't be in the last house because the basketball player is in the last house. So they must be in the second and fourth houses. The soccer player can't be in the fourth house because the basketball player is in the fourth house. So the soccer player must be in the second house, and the person who has a computer must be in the fourth house.

The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. The person who has a radio is in the third house, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

The person who likes milk lives to the right of the tea drinker. The tea drinker can't be in the last house because the basketball player is there. The person who likes milk can't be in the first house because the person who has a gameboy is there. So the tea drinker must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house. But the person who is wearing loafers is already in the third house. So the person who likes milk must be the person who is wearing high heels.

The person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. The person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, and the person who had stew can't be in the last house because the basketball player is there. So the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.

The person who had stew can't be in the first house because the person who has a gameboy is there. The person who had stew can't be in the last house because the basketball player is there. So the person who had stew must be in the second house.

The person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who has a computer. The person who has a radio is in the third house, so the person who is wearing boots must be in the second house, and the person who has a computer must be in the fourth house.

So the person who has a computer lives in house number 4."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's one person in each house. They all had different lunch, like pizza and fried rice. And they all like different kinds of books, like science fiction and history.

The clue says the person who had fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book person. That means the fried rice person lives in house number 2. Now, we gotta figure out who's who.

Since there's only two houses, the fried rice person can't live in house 1. So, the fried rice person lives in house number 2. And the pizza person lives in house number 1.

The clue also says they all like different kinds of books. That means one person likes science fiction and the other person likes history. Since the fried rice person lives in house number 2, the science fiction person must live in house number 1.

So, the science fiction person lives in house number 1."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they all got different stuff:

- One person has a dog, one has horses
- One person likes blue, one likes white
- One person likes root beer, one likes water
- One person plays the violin, one plays the piano

Clue 1: The person who plays the piano lives in the first house.

Clue 2: The person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who has horses.

Clue 3: The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

So, the person who plays the piano lives in house 1. Since the piano is a musical instrument, and the only two options are violin and piano, the person who plays the piano must be the one who plays the piano.

The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house, so they live in house 1. Since the person who plays the piano lives in house 1, the person who likes white must be the dog owner.

Now, let's look at Clue 2. The person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who has horses. Since the dog owner (who likes white) lives in house 1, the root beer lover must live in house 2. The person who has horses must live in house 2, as the root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner.

So, the dog owner lives in house 1, and the horse owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. That's clue #1.

The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. That's clue #3.

The violinist doesn't live in the fourth house. That's clue #4.

There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. That's clue #5.

The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. That's clue #6.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who had stew lives in the second house. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. The violinist doesn't live in the fourth house. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist.

The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. That's clue 7. 

The person who likes green lives left of the person who is wearing running shoes. That's clue 5. 

The person who is wearing sandals lives left of the person who has a vase of tulips. That's clue 8.

"Let's figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

We got some clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

So, if the person eating apples lives in the third house, that means the person eating mangos lives in the second house, 'cause they gotta be right before the apple eater.

"Let's figure out where the person who is wearing boots lives.

We know that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

We also know that the person who is wearing loafers and likes red live directly next to each other. That means they can't be in the first house, 'cause the person with carnations is already there. So, they must be in the second or third house.

The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. And the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. So, the person who likes white must live in the second house.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives in the second house. That means the person who has a vase of tulips can't be in the second house, so they must be in the first house.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives in the second house. That means the person who has a vase of tulips is the science fiction book fanatic.

The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, the history book buff must live in the third house.

The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. So, they must live in the first or second house.

The person who is wearing loafers and likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers and likes red must live in the first house.

So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house. The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with the rose lives.

We know that the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

There's one house between the person who only drinks water and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk can't live in the first house, and they can't live in the last house either. That means they live in the middle house, which is house number 2. But wait, we already know someone lives in house number 2! That someone has a bouquet of lilies. So, the person who likes milk must live in house number 3.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: house number 1 (water), house number 2 (lilies), and house number 3 (milk).

The person with the rose bouquet can't live in the first house (water), and they can't live in the second house (lilies). That means they live in the last house, which is house number 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's figure out where the cricketer lives.

We know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house (clue 9). The swimmer lives in the first house, so the swimmer is the person wearing loafers.

The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes green (clue 2). The person who likes green lives in the second house.

The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio (clue 10). The person who has a phone lives in the second house. The person who has a radio must live in the third house. However, this is a contradiction, as the tennis player (who likes yellow) lives in the third house. Therefore, the person who has a radio must live in the first house.

The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 4). The swimmer lives in the first house, so the cricketer must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

We start with the tennis player and the television. The tennis player is to the left of the television. We got: 
Tennis player - Television - ?

The golfer can't live in the second house, so the golfer must live in either the first or the third house.

The computer and tulips person live next to each other. They can't live in the first house 'cause the tennis player is already there. So, they must live in the third house.

Now we got: 
Tennis player - ? - Computer - Tulips - Television - ?

The rose bouquet person lives to the right of the radio person. The radio person lives to the right of the television. So, the rose bouquet person must live in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

We know the violinist lives in the second house. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist, and the guitarist lives to the right of the violinist. So, the order is: violinist, basketball player, guitarist.

The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist, so the basketball player must be in the third house.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fourth house.

The cricketer lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be the cricketer.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house, but we already know the basketball player lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing high heels must be the basketball player.

The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist. Since the violinist lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the first house, the cellist must live in the fifth house, but we already know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, so the cellist must live in the fourth house, which is taken by the cricketer. This means the person who is wearing sandals must live in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's one person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- One person has a dog, one person has fish

- One person is wearin' high heels, one person is wearin' sandals

Clue 1 says the person wearin' high heels is right next to the fish person. Clue 2 says the person who had grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

So, the person who had grilled cheese lives in house number 2. That means the fish person lives in house number 1.

Now, we gotta figure out who's wearin' high heels. Clue 1 says the person wearin' high heels is right next to the fish person. Since the fish person lives in house number 1, the person wearin' high heels must live in house number 1.

The only person left is the dog person. They gotta live in house number 2.

So, the person who had stew lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

If the person who had pizza lives in house 1, then the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. But then, the person who likes white can't live in house 3 or house 4 because the person who had stew lives in house 1. So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

If the person who had pizza lives in house 2, then the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. But then, the person who likes white can't live in house 3 or house 4 because the person who had stew lives in house 1. So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

If the person who had pizza lives in house 3, then the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. But then, the person who likes white can't live in house 3 or house 4 because the person who had stew lives in house 1. So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

If the person who had pizza lives in house 4, then the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. But then, the person who likes white can't live in house 3 or house 4 because the person who had stew lives in house 1. So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the person who likes white lives in house 4, and the person who is eating oranges lives in house 2.

Now, let's look at the options again. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza lives in house 2, the person who is eating apples lives in house 3 or house 4.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"Let's figure out where the person with the gameboy lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person with the television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person with the phone doesn't live in the second house.
4. The person with boots lives to the left of the person with loafers.
5. There are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with sandals.

From clue 4, we know the person with boots lives in the first house. Clue 5 tells us there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with sandals. This means the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with sandals lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's look at the arrangement:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television
- House 5: Sandals

The only person left is the person with the gameboy. Since the person with the television lives in the fourth house, the person with the gameboy must live in the remaining house, which is house 2. However, we have already assigned house 2 to the person with loafers. This means the person with the gameboy must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's think about this thing. There's a house with a person in it, and they like milk. That can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who likes milk can't live in the first house. That means the person who likes milk lives in the third house. 

Now, there's a person who likes coffee, and they can't live in the second house. They can't live in the first house either, 'cause the person who likes coffee can't live in the first house. That means the person who likes coffee lives in the third house. But we already know that the person who likes coffee lives in the third house, so that's good.

There's a person who wears high heels, and they live in the second house. That's a fact.

The person who wears running shoes lives in the third house. That's another fact.

So, the person who wears high heels lives in the second house. That's the answer. 

The answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. So, there's this one clue that says the person wearin' loafers don't live in the first house. That means they gotta live in the second house. And then there's another clue that says the mystery book person don't live in the second house. That means the mystery book person lives in the first house. 

So, the person wearin' loafers lives in the second house. That's the answer."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know that the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. This means they can't be in the third or fourth house, because the person who had stew lives in the second house (clue 6) and the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house (clue 10). So, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy must be in the first or second house.

We also know that the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 2). The person who is wearing sandals can't be in the first house, because the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house (clue 9). So, the person who is wearing sandals must be in the third or fourth house.

Now, let's look at clue 8. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. This means they can't be in the third or fourth house, because the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house. So, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first or second house.

We also know that the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 4). The person who has a vase of tulips can't be in the third house, because the person who had pizza lives in the third house. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have two possibilities: the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live in the first house, or the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live in the first house.

If the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live in the first house, then the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house. But then, the person who had pizza can't live in the third house, because the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. This means the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house, but this is not an option.

If the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live in the first house, then the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house (clue 9), so the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the second house. The person who had stew lives in the second house (clue 6), so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 2), so the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's think about this. There's a person in house 1 and a person in house 2. The person in house 1 is eating mangos.

Clue 1 says the person with the rose lives to the left of the person with the lilies. Clue 2 says the saxophonist doesn't live in house 1. Clue 3 says the person eating mangos lives in house 1. 

So, the person eating mangos lives in house 1. The person eating apples can't live in house 1, 'cause that's the person eating mangos. The person eating apples must live in house 2."

We also know that the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fourth house.

We also know that the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Grilled cheese (unknown preference)
- House 2: Yellow (unknown preference)
- House 3: Green (unknown preference)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (unknown preference)

We know that the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the second house, which is occupied by the person who likes yellow. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the arrangement.

"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know from clue 1 that the bird keeper and the person with tulips live next to each other. Since there are only two houses between the percussionist and the truck driver, and the bird keeper and the tulip owner live next to each other, the bird keeper and the tulip owner must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Since the bird keeper and the tulip owner are in houses 1 and 2, the fish enthusiast must be in house 3.

- House 2: person who owns a rose bouquet, person who has a rose bouquet, person who has a carnations arrangement
- House 3: person who likes yellow, person who likes yellow, person who likes yellow

"So, there's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. There's one person in each house. They all like different stuff:

- One person plays a piano and one plays a cello
- One person likes red and one likes green
- One person likes mystery books and one likes fantasy books

Clue 1: The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house.
Clue 2: The person who plays the cello lives in the first house.
Clue 3: The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house. The person who plays the cello also lives in the first house. Since the cello player lives in the first house, the fantasy book person must be the one who likes red, 'cause the cello player is the only one left in the first house.

Now, from clue 3, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book person (who likes red) lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The only person left is the mystery book person, and they must live in the first house, 'cause the second house is already taken by the person who likes green.

"I think I figured it out. There's a house with a history book person in it, and that's house number 1. Then there's a house with a golfer in it, and that's house number 2. Now, we gotta find the house with the swimmer. 

We know there's one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book person. So, the swimmer can't be in house 1 (history book) or house 3 (science fiction). That leaves house 2, but that's already taken by the golfer. 

So, the only place left for the swimmer is house 3."
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

There's a person in each house, and they all have different things:

- They all ate different foods: fried rice and spaghetti
- They all have different pets: one has a cat and one has horses
- They all like different kinds of books: one likes history and one likes romance
- They all wear different shoes: one has sandals and one has running shoes

There's a clue: the person with sandals lives next to the person with horses. That means the person with horses lives in house 2, and the person with sandals lives in house 1.

Another clue says the history book person lives to the right of the spaghetti eater. Since the person with horses lives in house 2, the spaghetti eater must live in house 1.

Now, let's think about the rest:

- One person likes cats, and one person likes horses. The person with horses lives in house 2, so the cat person must live in house 1.
- One person likes history, and one person likes romance. The history person lives to the right of the spaghetti eater (house 1), so the history person must live in house 2.

So, we got:

- House 1: cat person, spaghetti eater, wearing sandals
- House 2: history person, horse owner, wearing running shoes

Since the fried rice eater must live in house 1, the answer is (A) 1."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they're all different. They got different flowers in their house, like lilies and daffodils. They also play different instruments, like a flute and a saxophone. And they got different cars, like a convertible and a sedan.

There's a clue that says the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has lilies. And another clue that says the flute player don't live in the first house.

So, if the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has lilies, that means the person who has lilies can't live in the first house. And if the flute player don't live in the first house, that means the flute player must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about it some more. If the flute player lives in the second house, that means the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house. And that means the person who has lilies lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the romance book lover lives.

We know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, and the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. We also know there's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.

We know the flutist lives in the second house. So, the person who likes milk must live in house 2, but we already know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1 or 2. This means the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

We know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. We also know the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist lives in house 5, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: root beer lover, person who likes yellow, person who likes red, person who ate fried rice, person who ate spaghetti
- House 2: flutist, person who likes milk, person who had stew, person who only drinks water
- House 3: saxophonist, person who ate grilled cheese, cellist, person who had pizza
- House 4: coffee drinker, percussionist
- House 5: person who likes blue

The person who likes blue lives in house 5. The coffee drinker lives in house 4. The percussionist lives in house 5."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes white lives.

We know that the person who likes green don't live in the second house. We also know that the person who had stew don't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green and the person who had stew can't live in the second house.

We also know that the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who likes blue can't live in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

The person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

We know that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. We also know that there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. This means the person who likes white can't live in the first or second house, because the person who likes blue and the person who likes red already occupy those houses.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't live in the first or second house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth or fifth house.

The only house left for the person who likes white is the fourth house.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"I figgered out the puzzle thingy. So, we got 3 houses and 3 people. Each person likes somethin' different: red, yellow, and green. They also play different instruments: drums, piano, and violin. And they play different sports: baseball, tennis, and basketball.

Clue 1 says the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Clue 2 says the person who likes red lives in the third house. Clue 3 says the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. Clue 4 says the person who likes yellow don't live in the second house. And Clue 5 says the drummer lives in the second house.

So, we know the drummer lives in the second house. The person who likes yellow can't live in the second house (Clue 4), so they must live in the first or third house. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player (Clue 1), and the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player (Clue 3). That means the basketball player can't live in the third house, 'cause the violinist would be to the right of them, and there's no one left for the violinist to be to the right of.

So, the basketball player must live in the first house. The drummer lives in the second house, and the violinist lives in the third house. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 2).

The answer is (A) 1."

The cat lover can't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 too. That means the person wearing loafers lives in house 2.

Now, we know the person wearing high heels is the history book buff, and the cat lover is in house 1. The person wearing loafers lives in house 2. The person with a computer lives in house 2, and the person with a radio lives in house 1. The romance book lover can't live in house 1, so they live in house 2.

"Let's think about this thing. There's a row of houses with 3 people in 'em. Each person plays a diffrent instrument and eats a diffrent kind of fruit. We gotta figure out where the pianist lives.

Clue 1: The pianist and the person who's eating kiwis live right next to each other. That means they can't be in houses 1 and 3, 'cause there's no one in between. So they gotta be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

Clue 2: The flutist lives to the right of the violinist. If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist can't be in house 1, 'cause there's no one in between. So the flutist has to be in house 2 or 3. If the violinist is in house 2, the flutist can be in house 3. If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist can't be in house 3, 'cause the person eating kiwis is in house 3.

Clue 3: There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. That means the person eating grapes can't be in house 1 or 3, 'cause there's no one in between. So they gotta be in house 2. But wait, we already said the flutist can't be in house 2! That's a problem.

Clue 4: There's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis. We already figured out the violinist can't be in house 3, 'cause the person eating kiwis is in house 3. So the violinist has to be in house 1 or 2. But we already said the person eating grapes is in house 2, and the flutist can't be in house 2. So the violinist has to be in house 1.

Now we got a problem. The person eating grapes can't be in house 1, 'cause the violinist is in house 1. That means the person eating grapes has to be in house 3. But we said there's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. That's a problem.

Wait a minute... If the person eating grapes is in house 3, and there's one house between them and the person eating kiwis, that means the person eating kiwis has to be in house 2. And the violinist has to be in house 1. And the flutist has to be in house 3.

So the pianist lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"So, there's this thing about two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they're all eating different kinds of fruit. One's eating kiwis and the other's eating oranges.

There's also some other stuff: they all like different kinds of books. One likes history books and the other likes fantasy books. 

Now, here's what I know: the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. And the person who likes fantasy books can't live in the first house. That means the person who likes fantasy books must live in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes red lives.

We know from clue 5 that the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. We also know from clue 8 that the person who likes red lives in the third house. Clue 9 says the person who has a radio lives in the third house, so that's true. 

Now, let's look at clue 10. It says the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who has a television lives in the second house. Clue 1 says the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, so the bird keeper lives in the third house.

Clue 4 says the cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper, so the cat lover lives in the fourth house. Clue 3 says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover lives in the fourth house, the dog owner lives in the second house.

Clue 6 says the person who had pizza doesn't live in the third house. Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. Clue 2 says the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. Clue 11 says the person who has a computer doesn't live in the second house. Clue 12 says there's one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: person who likes yellow
- House 2: person who has a television
- House 3: person who ate fried rice
- House 4: person who likes green, person who ate grilled cheese, person who likes red, person who is a cat lover, person who owns horses, person who is a bird keeper

The person who likes red lives in the third house."
"I think I got it. So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's one person in each house, and they all do different things. One plays a piano and the other plays a cello. One likes root beer and the other likes tea.

Clue 1 says the person who likes root beer can't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello.

So, if the person who likes root beer can't live in the second house, that means they must live in the first house. And if the person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello, that means the piano player must live in the first house too, 'cause the cello player can't live in the first house.

So, the person who likes root beer lives in house number 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

We know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house. We also know the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fourth or fifth house.

We also know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fifth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the fifth house (because the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house.

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the fifth house (because the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house. The person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person wearing sandals
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations and sandals

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in either the first, second, or third house.

The person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person wearing sandals
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations and sandals

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the fifth house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in either the first, second, or third house.

"Let's figure out where the pianist lives.

We got a bunch of clues, and I'm gonna try to make sense of 'em.

From clue 10, we know the swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other. They can be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4.

Clue 3 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white. If they're in houses 1 and 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

Clue 4 says the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, if they're in houses 1 and 2, the swimmer must be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water must be in house 2. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the swimmer must be in house 3 and the person who only drinks water must be in house 4.

Clue 5 says there's one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the tennis player must be in house 4, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 1. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the tennis player must be in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 2.

Clue 6 says there's one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the percussionist must be in house 1, and the person who likes green must be in house 3. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the percussionist must be in house 2, and the person who likes green must be in house 4.

Clue 7 says the saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the saxophonist must be in house 1, and the tennis player must be in house 2. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the saxophonist must be in house 1, and the tennis player must be in house 3.

Clue 8 says there's one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the person who likes blue must be in house 2, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4.

Clue 9 says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the tea drinker must be in house 2, and the person who likes white must be in house 1. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the tea drinker must be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2.

Clue 11 says the coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 2, and the pianist must be in house 1. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 3, and the pianist must be in house 2.

Clue 12 says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the tea drinker must be in house 2. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the tea drinker must be in house 4.

Now, let's put it all together. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 1 and 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3, and the pianist must be in house 4. But we can't have the tennis player in house 4, 'cause there's gotta be one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. So, the swimmer and the person who likes white can't be in houses 1 and 2.

If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 3 and 4, the person who likes blue must be in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the pianist must be in house 4. This looks good.

So, the pianist lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know that the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

We also know that the person who likes green lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

The person who ate spaghetti can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. That's house number 3.

The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. The person who had stew can't live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. The person who is wearing boots can't live in the third house because the person who had stew can't live in the second house. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

The person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes white, wearing boots, eating spaghetti
- House 2: Person who likes green, eating fried rice
- House 3: Person who likes red, wearing high heels, eating stew

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house number 2. The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

We know that the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house. We also know that the person with the rose bouquet lives next to the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the second house.

We also know that the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person with the carnations arrangement must live in the first house.

The person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement. This means the romance book lover lives in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (tulips)
- House 4: ? (rose bouquet)

We know that the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, but we don't know who lives in the fourth house. We also know that the person with the tulips lives in the third house, and the person with the tulips lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the person with the tulips lives in the third house.

Since the person with the tulips lives in the third house, the person with the lilies must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. There's one person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- They all drink different drinks: one likes coffee and one likes water
- They all wear different shoes: one's got loafers and one's got sandals
- They all like different kinds of books: one likes science fiction and one likes romance

Clue 1 says the coffee drinker's to the left of the person with sandals.
Clue 2 says the science fiction person's in the first house.

So, the science fiction person's in house 1. That means the coffee drinker's in house 1 too, 'cause they gotta be to the left of the person with sandals. Now, the person with sandals's gotta be in house 2.

That leaves the romance book lover. They can't be in house 1, 'cause that's the science fiction person. So, they gotta be in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. So, there's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. One person lives in each house. They all play different instruments and have different devices.

One person plays the piano and one person plays the drums. One person has a radio and one person has a phone.

The person who plays the drums lives next to the person who has the radio. That means the person who plays the drums lives in the house on the left. If the person who plays the drums lived in the house on the right, then the person who has the radio would live in the house on the left, which is not true.

So, the person who plays the drums lives in the house on the left. The person who plays the piano lives in the house on the right. The person who has the radio lives in the house on the right, and the person who has the phone lives in the house on the left.

So, the person who has the phone lives in house 1."
"I think I got it figured out. There's a person who likes white, a person who likes blue, and a person who likes yellow. They live in houses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

The person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. That's a car that opens up, like a top. 

There's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. That means the person who likes white can't live in house 3, 'cause then there wouldn't be a house in between. So, the person who likes white lives in house 1. 

The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 3. So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. 

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. That's the correct answer."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

"So, there's this thing with three houses and three people. They all ate different kinds of food and like different kinds of books. 

Clue 1 says the person who ate spaghetti is to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Clue 2 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. Clue 3 says the fantasy book person lives in the second house. 

So, the fantasy book person and the fried rice eater must be in the same house, 'cause they both live in the second house. Clue 1 also says the spaghetti eater is to the left of the fried rice eater, so the spaghetti eater must be in the first house. 

Now, we gotta figure out who ate what. We know the fantasy book person is in the first house, the spaghetti eater is in the first house, and the fried rice eater is in the second house. That means the science fiction book person must be in the third house. 

The science fiction book person is in the third house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house. 

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to solve this puzzle thingy.

Okay, so we got two houses, and each house has a person in it. They got different flowers in their foyer, and different pets. We know that the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. That's a big clue!

Let's think about it... If the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the person with the tulips (I think that's what they're called) must live in the other house, which is house number 2. And the person with the dog must live in house number 1.

So, the person with the carnations lives in house number 1, and the person with the tulips lives in house number 2.

The answer is: (B) 1"
"Let's think about this. There's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different things: milk, water, yellow, green, kiwis, grapes, and high heels, sandals.

Clue 1 says the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. That means the person who wears high heels can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who drinks water has to be in the first house.

Clue 2 says the person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who likes yellow can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who wears sandals has to be in the first house.

Clue 3 says the person who eats kiwis lives in the second house. That means the person who eats kiwis is in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who eats kiwis is in the second house. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. The person who likes yellow can't be in the first house, so the person who likes yellow has to be in the second house. The person who drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. The person who wears high heels can't be in the first house, so the person who wears high heels has to be in the first house.

So, the person who wears high heels lives in house 1."
"Let's think about this thing. There's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. There's one person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- One person got a TV, one person got a phone
- One person is wearin' sandals, one person is wearin' high heels
- One person likes tea, one person only likes water
- One person is eatin' kiwis, one person is eatin' grapes

There's some clues:

1. The person wearin' high heels is to the left of the person wearin' sandals.
2. The person eatin' grapes and the person wearin' sandals are right next to each other.
3. The person who likes tea is to the left of the person with the TV.

So, if the person wearin' high heels is to the left of the person wearin' sandals, and the person eatin' grapes is right next to the person wearin' sandals, that means the person wearin' high heels is in the first house, and the person eatin' grapes is in the second house. The person who likes tea can't be in the first house 'cause the person with the TV has to be to the left of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker is in the third house, and the person with the TV is in the fourth house.

Now, we got the order: 
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Eating grapes
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: TV

The person eatin' kiwis can't be in the first, second, or third house, so they must be in the fourth house. But wait, that's the TV person's house! That means the person eatin' kiwis can't be in the fourth house. So, we gotta swap the person eatin' kiwis with the person wearin' high heels. The person eatin' kiwis is in the first house, and the person wearin' high heels is in the second house.

So, the person eatin' kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think about this thing. There's three houses, and three people. They like different drinks and play different instruments. 

The first clue says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. That means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3. 

The second clue says there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist. That means the guitarist can't be in house 1, and the guitarist can't be in house 3. 

The third clue says the tea drinker lives in the first house. That means the tea drinker is in house 1.

The fourth clue says the violinist doesn't live in the third house. That means the violinist can be in either house 1 or 2.

Now, let's think about it some more. If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist can't be in house 3. If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist can't be in house 3. But if the water drinker is in house 2, the cellist can be in house 1, and the violinist can be in house 3. That sounds good.

So, the guitarist lives in house 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

We know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. That's clue 1.

We also know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. That's clue 3. So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

Now, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. That's clue 7. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

We know the person wearing running shoes can't live in the first house. That's clue 2. So, the person wearing running shoes can live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

We know there's one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. That's clue 5. So, the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers must live in the second and fourth houses, or the third and fifth houses.

We know the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. That's clue 6. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first or second house.

Now we got a few possibilities:
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- The person wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
- The coffee drinker lives in the third house.

But if the person wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, it wouldn't work because there's one house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers. So, the person wearing loafers must live in the fifth house.

The tea drinker lives in the fifth house, that's clue 4. So, the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

Now we got the order:
- The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
- The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
- The person wearing loafers lives in the fifth house.

The only remaining house is the second house, which must be occupied by the person wearing running shoes.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. The answer is (A) 1."

Clue 6 says the person who has a radio doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the person who has a radio must live in either the first or the third house.

Clue 1 says the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other. Clue 8 says the person who has a computer doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the person who has a computer must live in the third house. That means the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

Now, we gotta put the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a radio lives in either the first or the third house, and the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, the person who has a radio must live in the first house.

The person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who has a TV (clue 2). Since the person who has a radio lives in the first house, the person who has a phone must live in the second house, and the person who has a TV must live in the fourth house.

The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (clue 7). The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 5). So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

"I think I got it. So, there's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. They got different stuff goin' on in 'em.

One person plays a drum, one plays a guitar. One person had pizza, one had grilled cheese. And one person has a dog, one has a bird.

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes green must be in the first house. We can write: G _ _ _ _

The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis, and the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. This means that the person who likes red must be in the third house. We can write: G _ R _ _

The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, and there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means that the person who likes white must be in the first house. We can write: W G R _ _

The person who is eating a banana lives in the last house. We can write: W G R B _

Now, we can fill in the remaining house with the person who is eating kiwis. The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know that:
- One person ate stew.
- One person ate fried rice.
- One person likes horses.
- One person likes cats.
- One person likes mystery books.
- One person likes science fiction books.
- One person is wearing running shoes.
- One person is wearing sandals.

Clue 1 says that the person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

Clue 2 says that the mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the cat lover must be in house 2.

Clue 3 says that the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: 
  - Eating oranges
  - Eating stew
  - Mystery book reader
  - Wearing shoes: unknown
- House 2: 
  - Eating fried rice
  - Cat lover
  - Wearing running shoes

Now, let's think about the remaining clues. We know that one person is wearing running shoes, and that person is in house 2. We also know that one person is wearing sandals, but we don't know who that is yet.

We know that one person likes horses, and one person likes cats. Since the cat lover is in house 2, the horse lover must be in house 1.

We also know that one person likes science fiction books, and one person likes mystery books. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the science fiction book reader must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: 
  - Eating oranges
  - Eating stew
  - Mystery book reader
  - Wearing shoes: unknown
- House 2: 
  - Eating fried rice
  - Cat lover
  - Science fiction book reader
  - Wearing running shoes

We still don't know who is wearing shoes in house 1. But we can figure it out. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the person eating stew is also in house 1, the person wearing shoes in house 1 must be the person eating oranges.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) 1"
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

There's a person in each house, and they all have different flowers, drinks, and devices. We gotta use the clues to find out who likes milk.

Clue 1 says the person with daffodils lives to the left of the person with the phone. That means the order is: ?, ?, ?, ?, ? (where ? is the person we don't know yet).

Clue 2 says the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. So, the order is: ?, water, ?, ?, ?.

Clue 3 says the root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the order is: root beer, ?, ?, ?, ?.

Clue 4 says the person with the TV doesn't live in the second house. That means the order is: root beer, ?, ?, ?, ? (we don't know who's in the second house yet).

Clue 5 says the person with the TV lives to the right of the person with the tulips. We know the tulips are in the third house, so the order is: root beer, ?, ?, tulips, ?.

Now we know the tulips are in the third house. Clue 2 says the person who drinks water lives in the second house. So, the order is: root beer, water, ?, tulips, ?.

Clue 1 says the person with daffodils lives to the left of the person with the phone. That means the person with the phone lives in the fourth house. So, the order is: root beer, water, ?, tulips, phone.

The only person left is the person who likes milk. Since the person with the TV lives to the right of the person with the tulips, and the person with the tulips is in the third house, the person with the TV must be in the fourth house. That means the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with a computer lives.

We know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

The person with a phone lives to the left of the person eating mangos. The person wearing boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. The person eating kiwis lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

So, the person with a phone can't live in the third house, and the person eating kiwis can't live in the first house. The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk, so the person who likes milk can't live in the first house either.

The person wearing loafers lives in the first house, and the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The person with a phone lives to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person wearing boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. The person wearing loafers lives in the first house, so the person with a phone can't live in the first house. The person eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person with a phone must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person wearing loafers, eating grapes, drinking water
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes, eating kiwis
- House 3: Person wearing boots, eating mangos, with a phone

The person with a computer lives in house 2."

7. The cricketer don't live in the third house.

We know the person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils (clue 6). So, the person with roses can't live in the first house 'cause the person with daffodils gotta live in the first house (clue 6). The person with daffodils can't live in the third house 'cause the cricketer don't live in the third house (clue 7). So, the person with daffodils gotta live in the first house.

Now, the person with roses gotta live in the second house 'cause the person with daffodils lives in the first house (clue 6).

The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player (clue 5). The person with horses lives right next to the person with carnations (clue 4). So, the person with horses gotta live in the second house 'cause the person with roses lives in the second house (clue 6).

The golfer and the baseball player live right next to each other (clue 3). The person with roses lives in the second house, and the person with daffodils lives in the first house. So, the golfer and the baseball player gotta live in the first and second houses, respectively.

- House 2: Person with roses
- House 3: Person with daffodils and carnations

The person with horses lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

We know the person eating oranges lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

We also know the person owning horses lives in the third house. That's house number 3.

Now, we gotta think about the person eating mangos. They can't live in the third house 'cause that's where the horse owner lives. And they can't live in the first house 'cause that's where the orange eater lives. So, they gotta live in the second house.

The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible gotta live next to each other. That means they gotta be in the second house, and the person driving the truck gotta be in the first house.

The only person left for the first house is the dog owner. So, the dog owner lives in house number 1.

The person eating mangos lives in house number 2, and the person driving the convertible lives in house number 3.

Now, we gotta figure out who's driving the truck. We know the dog owner lives in house number 1, the person eating mangos lives in house number 2, and the person driving the convertible lives in house number 3. That means the person driving the truck lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. Saxophonist (no color) - ?
2. Computer (blue) - ?
3. Radio (green) - ?
4. Gameboy (red) - ?
5. Yellow (yellow) - ?
6. Violinist (white) - ?

The person who likes blue lives in the first house, and the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who likes blue must be the one who has a computer.

The person who likes red lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, so the person who likes red must be the one who lives in the fourth house.

The person who likes white lives in the sixth house.

The person who likes green lives in the third house.

The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

The person who has a phone lives in the sixth house.

The person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house.

Now"
"Let's figure out who lives in the house with the horses.

We got some clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

So, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but not in that order. The cellist lives in house 1, so the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in house 2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover, so the history book buff must be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 2.

Now we got:
- House 1: cellist, history book buff
- House 2: root beer lover, guitarist, cat lover

The only one left is the person who owns horses, and that's the person in house 1."
"So, there's this thing with three houses and three people. Each person has different pets and flowers. 

The clues say:
1. The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner can't live in the second house.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

Let's think about it. If the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations, that means the bird keeper can't live in the third house. 

The dog owner can't live in the second house, so they can only live in the first or third house. 

Now, if the dog owner lives in the first house, the person with tulips would have to live in the third house. But that would mean the person with carnations lives in the second house, which is wrong. So, the dog owner can't live in the first house.

That means the dog owner lives in the third house. 

The person with tulips has to live in the second house, 'cause it's to the right of the dog owner. 

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

We know the swimmer lives in the fourth house. That's house number 4.

We also know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. The vase of tulips is in the third house, so the high heels are in the first or second house. But the person wearing high heels can't be in the second house because the person wearing loafers can't be in the second house (clue 5). So, the high heels are in the first house.

The person eating apples can't be in the third house (clue 2). The person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a computer (clue 8). The person with a vase of tulips is in the third house, so the person eating oranges must be in the first house. The person eating apples must be in the fourth house.

There's one house between the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis (clue 3). The person eating apples is in the fourth house, so the person wearing boots must be in the second house, and the person eating kiwis must be in the third house.

The person wearing loafers can't be in the second house (clue 5). So, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house.

The person with a phone lives to the left of the person wearing sandals (clue 7). The person wearing loafers is in the first house, so the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.

The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana (clue 11). The person wearing sandals is in the second house, so the person eating a banana must be in the third house. But we already know the person eating kiwis is in the third house, so the person eating a banana must be the person eating kiwis.

Now we have the order: 
- High heels: 1
- Loafers: 1
- Banana: 3
- Kiwis: 3
- Apples: 4
- Computer: 4
- Phone: 2
- Orange: 1
- Tulips: 3
- Rose: 2
- Gameboy: 1

The person wearing loafers lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

We also know the person owning horses doesn't live in the first house. That means they can live in either the second, third, or fourth house.

The person owning horses can't live in the second house, so they must live in either the third or fourth house.

The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating mangos is in the first house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in either the second or third house.

The person eating a banana can't live in the third house. So, they must live in either the first or fourth house.

The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner. Since the person eating mangos is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the dog owner must be in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: Banana
House 3: ? 
House 4: Dog owner

The person owning horses can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house.

The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating a banana is in the second house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in the third house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"So, there's this thing with three houses and three people. They like different kinds of books and have different pets. 

The clues say:
1. The romance book lover doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

So, the mystery book reader lives in the first house. That's a start. Now, the bird keeper has to live in the second house, 'cause they gotta be right next to the history book buff. And the history book buff can't be in the third house, so they gotta be in the third house.

Now, the romance book lover can't live in the third house, so they gotta live in either the first or the second house. But the mystery book reader is already in the first house, so the romance book lover has to live in the second house.

So, the romance book lover lives in house number 2."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We got some clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the apple eater and water drinker are in the first two houses. The apple eater can't be in the first house 'cause the water drinker can't be in the last house. So, the apple eater and water drinker are in the first and second houses.

Clue 3 says the mango eater can't be in the first house. Clue 4 says the mango eater can't be in the third house. Clue 5 says the apple eater is to the left of the tea drinker. So, the mango eater must be in the fourth house.

Clue 6 says the kiwi eater can't be in the third house. So, the kiwi eater can be in the first or fourth house. But clue 3 says the mango eater can't be in the first house, so the kiwi eater must be in the fourth house.

Now we got the order: 

House 1: water drinker
House 2: apple eater
House 3: root beer lover
House 4: mango eater, kiwi eater, coffee drinker

The coffee drinker lives in house 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who is eating a banana lives.

We know the person who likes white lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the person who likes white is in the second house, the baseball player must be in the fourth house.

There's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. Since the person who likes white is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the fifth house.

The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the baseball player is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the third house, but that's where the soccer player is. So, the golfer must be the soccer player.

The cricketer doesn't live in the fifth house. Since the golfer is the soccer player, the cricketer must be in the first house.

The soccer player lives in the third house, but we already said that. So, the golfer must be in the first house.

The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the golfer is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house, but we already know the person who likes white lives in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must be in the third house, but we already know the soccer player is in the third house. This means the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house.

The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, 'cause there's two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. The baseball player is in the fourth house.

The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."

"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know the flutist lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. That means the flutist can't live in house 3, 'cause the minivan lives to the right of the flutist. So, the flutist lives in house 1 or 2.

We also know the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. That means they can't be in the same house, 'cause the minivan lives in between. So, the truck and gameboy can't be in house 1, 'cause the flutist lives there. That means the truck and gameboy live in house 2 or 3.

We know the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the truck. That means the minivan can't live in house 1, 'cause the flutist lives there. So, the minivan lives in house 2.

"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We got some clues:

1. The truck driver lives to the right of the minivan driver.
2. The person with the rose lives to the left of the coffee drinker.
3. The SUV driver lives to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. The truck driver lives to the right of the root beer lover.
5. The person with lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with lilies lives in the second house. That means the first house can't be the second house, 'cause then the person with lilies would be in the first house, and we can't have two people in the same house.

So, the first house has to be the root beer lover. That's because the truck driver lives to the right of the root beer lover (clue 4), and the truck driver can't live in the second house (clue 5).

Now we got the first house as the root beer lover, and the second house as the person with lilies. The SUV driver lives to the left of the coffee drinker (clue 3), and the person with the rose lives to the left of the coffee drinker (clue 2). That means the SUV driver lives in the second house, and the person with the rose lives in the first house.

So, the order is: 
- The root beer lover lives in house 1.
- The person with the SUV lives in house 2.
- The person with the lilies lives in house 2.
- The person with the rose lives in house 1.
- The coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The coffee drinker lives in house 3. The correct answer is (C) 3."

We also know that the person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice lives directly next to the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

So the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, and the person who likes blue lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player, and the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. So, the percussionist must live in the first house, and the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the first house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who likes green must be the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who likes red must live in the first house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who likes red must be the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the basketball player must live in the third house. The person who likes red lives in the first house, so the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"So, there's this thing with three houses and three people. They all play different instruments and sports. 

The first clue says the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. That means the cricketer can't be in the last house, 'cause the cellist would be after 'em. 

The second clue says the basketball player lives in the second house. And the third clue says the violinist lives in the second house too. That means the basketball player and the violinist are in the same house. 

So, the cricketer's gotta be in the first house, and the basketball/violinist are in the second house. That leaves the third house for the cellist. 

Now, we gotta figure out who's playin' which sport. The only one left is soccer, and it's gotta be in the first house. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure out where the tea drinker lives.

We know the tea drinker lives in the third house. We also know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the fourth house.

We also know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house. The person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, so the person who only drinks water must be in the second house.

The person who likes white does not live in the third house. The tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. The person who likes green lives in the first house, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. The person who likes red must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:

1. White - Green - Daffodils - Water
2. Red - - - Lilies
3. Tea - - - Mystery
4. - - - - Carnations

The tea drinker lives in the third house, so the answer is (B) 3."
"Let's figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person who likes milk don't live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player don't live in the fourth house.
5. The guitarist don't live in the third house.
6. The guitarist live somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
7. The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
8. The fish enthusiast live somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
9. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
10. The person who owns horses live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. Clue 3 says the flutist lives in the fourth house, so the flutist must be the coffee drinker. But that's weird, 'cause it says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. So, we gotta think about this some more.

Clue 11 says the person who owns horses live in the fourth house. That means the fourth house is taken. Clue 2 says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, but we just figured out that the flutist (coffee drinker) can't live in the fourth house. So, we gotta think about this some more.

Clue 4 says the tennis player don't live in the fourth house. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. That means the tennis player can't live in the fourth house, or they'd be next to the coffee drinker. So, the tennis player must live in the first or second house.

Clue 7 says the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. Clue 8 says the fish enthusiast live somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Clue 9 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. That means the dog owner and the root beer lover can't live in the second house, 'cause the tennis player lives there. So, the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in the third house.

Now we got some stuff figured out:

- The flutist (coffee drinker) can't live in the fourth house.
- The person who owns horses live in the fourth house.
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live in the third house.
- The tennis player live in the first or second house.
- The fish enthusiast live somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

Clue 6 says the guitarist live somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Clue 5 says the guitarist don't live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

Clue 9 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. That means the person who only drinks water can't live in the fifth house, 'cause the fish enthusiast lives there. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

Now we got some more stuff figured out:

- The flutist (coffee drinker) can't live in the fourth house.
- The person who owns horses live in the fourth house.
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live in the third house.
- The tennis player live in the first or second house.
- The fish enthusiast live somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
- The guitarist live in the fifth house.
- The person who only drinks water live in the second house.

Clue 8 says the fish enthusiast live somewhere to the right of the basketball player. That means the fish enthusiast can't live in the first house, 'cause the tennis player lives there. So, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"I think I figured it out. There's a person in house 1 with flowers, and they got daffodils. And there's a person in house 2 with flowers, and they got carnations. The person in house 2 also plays the piano. So, the person with daffodils must be in house 1, 'cause the piano player is in house 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

We know the person eating oranges lives in the first house. Then we got the person eating a banana in the fourth house, and the person owning an SUV in the fourth house. That means the person eating a banana and the person owning an SUV are the same person. 

We also know the person eating apples lives directly left of the person eating a banana, so the person eating apples lives in the third house. 

The person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. The person eating grapes doesn't live in the fifth house, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person driving a minivan. That means the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house, and the person driving a minivan lives in the fifth house.

Now we got the following order: 
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Person eating grapes
- House 3: Person eating apples
- House 4: Person eating a banana, Person owning an SUV
- House 5: Person driving a minivan

The person owning a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement. We don't know who has carnations yet, but we know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fifth house. The person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. The person eating oranges lives in the first house, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house. That means the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, and the person eating grapes lives in the third house.

Now we got the following order: 
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips
- House 3: Person eating grapes
- House 4: Person eating a banana, Person owning an SUV
- House 5: Person driving a minivan

The person owning a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement. We know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fifth house, and the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house. That means the person with a carnations arrangement lives in the third house. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person eating a banana, so the person eating apples lives in the third house, and the person with a carnations arrangement lives in the third house.

Now we got the following order: 
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips
- House 3: Person eating apples, Person with a carnations arrangement
- House 4: Person eating a banana, Person owning an SUV
- House 5: Person driving a minivan

The person owning a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fifth house, and the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house. That means the person owning a sedan lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's think about this thing. We got 2 houses, and 2 people in each house. They like different stuff, like books, colors, food, drinks, and sports.

Clue 1 says the person who likes blue lives right next to the person who likes root beer. Clue 2 says the romance book lover can't live in the first house. Clue 3 says the root beer lover lives right after the person who had grilled cheese. Clue 4 says the soccer player lives in the second house.

So, the soccer player lives in the second house. That means the person who likes blue can't live in the second house, 'cause they gotta live next to the root beer lover. And the romance book lover can't live in the first house, so they gotta live in the second house. That means the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

Now, we gotta figure out who likes what. We know the person who likes blue lives in the first house, and the person who had grilled cheese lives in the first house too. That means the person who likes green lives in the second house. The root beer lover lives right after the person who had grilled cheese, so the root beer lover lives in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2. The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the swimmer lives.

We know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. Then, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. The person who likes green lives to the left of the swimmer, so the swimmer can't live in the second house. The person who likes red lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the swimmer. So, the swimmer can't live in the second or third house. The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house, so the swimmer can't live in the first or second house. The soccer player doesn't live in the fourth house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the soccer player can't live in the second house. The soccer player must live in the fifth house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the swimmer, so the swimmer can't live in the fifth house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house. The person who likes green lives to the left of the swimmer, so the swimmer lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 4."
"So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. They're numbered 1 and 2. There's a person in each house, and they all got different stuff.

The person in house 1 likes a cat, and the person in house 2 likes a bird. They also got different things: one has a computer, and the other has a gameboy. And they play different instruments: one plays the violin, and the other plays the guitar.

Clue 1 says the person who plays the violin lives in house 1. Clue 2 says the person with the computer lives to the left of the person who takes care of the bird.

So, the person who plays the violin lives in house 1. And the person with the computer lives to the left of the bird person. That means the person with the computer lives in house 1, 'cause the violinist is already in house 1.

Now, we gotta figure out who's in each house. The cat person, the bird person, the gameboy person, and the guitar person are left. House 1 is taken by the violinist and the computer person. That leaves house 2 for the cat person, the bird person, the gameboy person, and the guitar person.

The only one left for the bird person is house 2. So, the bird person lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's figure out where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person wearin' boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearin' high heels lives right next to the dog owner.
3. The person ownin' a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person ownin' an SUV lives right next to the person wearin' boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

So, from clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. That means the dog owner can't live in the first house, 'cause the cat lover's already there. The dog owner must live in the third house, 'cause that's the only other house left.

Now, from clue 4, we know the person ownin' an SUV lives right next to the person wearin' boots. Since the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, the person ownin' an SUV must live in the first house. But wait, we already know the cat lover lives in the first house, so the cat lover must be the person ownin' the SUV. That means the person wearin' boots must be the fish enthusiast.

From clue 1, we know the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, and we just figured out the fish enthusiast lives there. So, the fish enthusiast must be wearin' boots.

Now, we got the following info:
- House 1: cat lover (SUV)
- House 2: fish enthusiast (wearing boots)
- House 3: dog owner (wearing high heels), sedan

The only one left is the person wearin' runnin' shoes. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the second house. But we already know the fish enthusiast lives there. That means the fish enthusiast must be wearin' runnin' shoes.

So, the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."

The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. That's clue 3. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the first house.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. That's clue 4. That's good, 'cause we already thought that.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. That's clue 5. That's good, 'cause we already thought that too.

The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. That's clue 6. So, the person who likes green lives in the third house. But we already know the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must be the tea drinker.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. That's clue 7. That's good, 'cause we already thought that.

The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house. That's clue 8. So, the person eating oranges must live in either the first or second house. But we already know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

Now we got it! The person who is eating apples lives in the first house. That's option (C) 1."
"So, there's this thing with three houses and three people. Each person likes a different kind of book and has a different device. 

The clues say:
1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. Clue 1 says the history book buff lives to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person with the TV lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the TV is in the third house.

Now, clue 3 says the person with the computer lives to the right of the person with the phone. Since the history book buff is in the second house and the person with the TV is in the third house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. But that can't be right, 'cause clue 1 says the mystery book reader is to the left of the history book buff. So, the person with the phone must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the first house. That means the person with the computer is in the third house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: history book buff (phone)
- House 2: mystery book reader (computer)
- House 3: science fiction book fanatic (TV)

The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3. The correct answer is (B) 3."
"I don't think someone with St. Vitus's Dance would be good at ballet. They might have some weird movements, but it's not something you can control. It's like their body is doing its own thing. I don't think that would help them do fancy ballet moves."

There are 365 days in a year, so if he wrote one a day, he'd write 365 in a year. Half a year would be 182.5 days. If he wrote one a day, he'd write 182.5 theses in half a year. Since he lived more than half a year, he'd write more than 182.5 theses. So, he wouldn't run out of theses in half a year."
"I think waltz is less injurious than slam dance. I've seen people do slam dance and it looks super rough. They're always jumping and flipping around, and it looks like they might hurt themselves. My friend's cousin's brother-in-law is a dancer, and he said waltz is a lot easier on the body. Plus, it's just a more gentle dance, you know?"

"It's not possible to snowboard on Venus. The planet is way too hot and the air is super bad for you. It's like, you can't even breathe there. The pressure is also super high, it would squish you like a pancake. You wouldn't be able to survive on the surface."
"So, I was thinkin' about this Charlemagne guy and his dad, Pepin. I don't think Pepin was there when the Battle of Tours happened. I don't know much about it, but I think it was his son, Charles Martel, who fought in it. He was the king of the Franks, and I guess he won the battle."

The D'Artagnan's are just regular people, so they wouldn't stand a chance.

So, the answer is (A) No."

Augustus was his real name.
"The people who lived in the Confederate States didn't speak Old English. Old English is the language from a long time ago, like from the 5th to the 11th century. It's not the same as the English we speak today.

"Robert Wadlow was super tall, like, really, really tall. He was 8 ft 11.1 in. German Shepherds are dogs, and they're pretty short, like, not as tall as Robert Wadlow. So, yeah, Robert Wadlow would definitely be taller than a German Shepherd."

"I think the most expensive color in the world is not blue. I've heard that some special kind of paint or material is super expensive, and it's not even a color, it's like, a way to block all the light. I don't know what it's called, but it's really pricey."

"I don't think shootin' a bald eagle would get you more time in the clink than Michael Vick. I mean, Vick was in for 23 months, and that's a pretty long time.

I think the law says you can get up to 6 months in the slammer for messin' with a bald eagle, but that's still less than what Vick got."

For example, someone might seem really happy and outgoing one day, but then they might be really sad or anxious the next. Or, they might be really good at hiding their true thoughts and feelings, making it hard for others to notice what's going on inside their head.

So, to answer your question, I think the correct answer is:

"A slingshot is a thing that you use to launch rocks or other small stuff at people or animals. It's not a big gun like the kind that shoots big shells. It's more like a toy, but it can still hurt if you get hit.

"Lactic acid is like, a thing that happens in your body. It's not bad, it's just a natural part of how your muscles work. When you exercise or do stuff that makes you tired, your body makes lactic acid. It's like a waste product that your body gets rid of.

It's not something to worry about, but too much of it can make you feel icky. Like, you might get cramps or feel really tired. But that's not because the lactic acid is bad, it's just that your body is trying to get rid of it.

So, to answer your question, lactic acid is not bad. It's just a normal part of being human."

So, I think bull sharks are the worst."

Sesame seeds, on the other hand, are a type of seed that's high in oil. If you leave them out in the open, they can get stale or rancid. This is because the oil inside the seed can break down when it's exposed to air, heat, or light.

So, it's more likely for sesame seeds to go bad before white rice."

"I heard that Vellore Fort had some big bears in it. They were like, grizzly bears or something. I don't know, I wasn't there. But I think the people who lived there had to be careful 'cause those bears were supposed to be pretty aggressive. So, yeah, I think they needed to defend themselves."
The brain is not in the torso. It's in the head.
"So, you wanna know if a 500GB USB device can save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day. Well, I think that's a pretty big ask. I mean, how many hours of Netflix shows can you really fit on a 500GB device?

I'm no expert, but I think it's safe to say that a 500GB device is gonna run out of space pretty quick. I mean, have you seen the size of some of those Netflix shows? They're like, whoa. I think you'd be lucky if you could fit 5 or 6 hours of shows on that thing.

So, my answer is: No, a 500GB USB device is not enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
"I think Voyager 2 is way too heavy for Jon Brower Minnoch to break. He was a big dude, but not that big. I mean, I've seen him on TV, and he looked like a giant, but not like he could lift a spaceship."
"So, I was thinkin', if a hedgehog don't got a spinal cord, would it still be able to move around?

So, the answer would be... 

(B) No"
"The iPhone is a pretty cool device. It's like a super powerful computer that you can carry around with you everywhere. I think it's changed the way people do a lot of things, including science.

I've seen people using their iPhones to do all sorts of cool stuff, like taking pictures of plants and animals to help scientists learn more about them. They can even use the iPhone to collect data and send it to scientists who can study it and figure out new things.

So, I think the iPhone has definitely helped scientists in some way. It's like a tool that makes it easier for them to do their jobs."
"I think handedness don't really matter when it comes to using American Sign Language. I mean, I've seen people who are right-handed and people who are left-handed, and they all use their hands in different ways when signing. Some people might use their right hand more, and some people might use their left hand more. It's not like it's a rule or anything."

"Garfield likes lasagna and stuff, so I think he'd like canned food."

So, the answer is no, deaf people are not left out of enjoying music."

The Eiffel Tower wasn't really about the French Revolution. It was built for some kinda big fair thingy in Paris. It's a big metal stick in the ground that lots of people like to visit.
"I think the torso is pretty safe from big hits. Like, if you hit the femur or the stapes bone, it's not gonna hurt the torso that much. The rib cage and the breastbone are like a shield or something, they protect the insides. So, I'd say the torso is safe from those kinds of hits."
"I think Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu would have eaten Börek. It's a Turkish pastry, and he was a Turkish guy, so it's probably something he'd know about."

Plus, I don't think Micronesia's debt is that big, right? It's not like they owe a billion dollars or anything. I think it's more like a few hundred million. And even if he did try, I don't think he could just magic up that kind of cash. He'd have to sell a lot of stuff or something. So, I'd say the answer is no."
The names of The Powerpuff Girls are all alliterative.
"Dosa is a food that's made from rice and lentils, right? It's kinda sweet and stuff. I don't think it's good for someone who's tryin' to eat like that keto diet thingy. They gotta be low on carbs, and dosa's got a lot of carbs. So, I think the answer is... 

(B) No"
"I don't think Andy Warhol influenced Art Deco style. Art Deco is a style that came out a long time ago, like in the 1920s and 30s. It's all about fancy shapes, shiny things, and old-school glamour. Andy Warhol was a different kind of artist, he liked taking pictures of Campbell's soup cans and stuff. His style is more about everyday things, not fancy and old-school like Art Deco.

So, the correct answer is (A) No."

(A) No"
"I don't think the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would support trickle-down economics. They were all about helping everyone be equal and stuff.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) Yes."

Plus, she's kinda scary, and I don't think I'd want to be in a class with someone like that."

So, the answer is... 

A) No
B) Yes"

As for leopard seals, I don't know much about them. I know they're cute and all, but I don't know if they're kept at SeaWorld.

I guess some people might be worried about the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors, but I don't know if that's really a big deal. I've heard that doctors and experts say that SSRIs can be effective for treating depression in teenagers and young adults, but I'm not really sure what that means.

I mean, Dorton Arena is a pretty small place, and it's mostly used for sports and stuff. I don't think it could hold that many people. Plus, 30th Street Station is a huge place with lots of people comin' and goin' all day. It's just not possible."

Like, Lucy Lawless, the lady who played Xena, she was in some other TV shows. And Renee O'Connor, the lady who played Gabrielle, she was in some other TV shows too. I think she was in some sci-fi show or somethin'. And I'm pretty sure Ted Raimi, the guy who played Joxer, was in some other TV shows and movies. And I think Kevin Smith, the guy who played Autolycus, was in some other TV shows and movies too.

Henry Ford's last name is not really known by most people.
I don't know if Don King killed more people than Charles Manson. I don't know much about either of them.
"I think the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz could have had cerebral palsy. He's always talkin' and stuff, but he can't move around too good. He's all stiff and awkward, like someone who's got a problem with their muscles. Cerebral palsy is a thing where people's brains and bodies don't work together right, and it can make 'em have trouble movin' and stuff. So, yeah, it's possible the Scarecrow could have had that."

"I think Marvel's Gateway would be jealous of the Doctor's TARDIS. It's like, a time machine and all, but it looks like a normal police box on the outside. That's kinda cool, right? I mean, who wouldn't want to travel through time and space in a box that looks like a normal police box? It's like having a superpower and a normal house at the same time. Marvel's Gateway is just a portal thingy, it doesn't have that same magic."
I don't think you can watch all of JAG in six months. There's too many episodes.
"The small intestine is like a super long pipe in your tummy that helps get the good stuff from the food you eat. It's not good at breaking down things like cotton balls.

"You wanna know if you can save all the Game of Thrones episodes on your Samsung Galaxy A10e?

Honestly, I don't think so. I mean, I've heard of people trying to do that, but it's just not possible. The phone's storage is pretty small, and there are a lot of episodes. I think it's like, 73 or something? And each one's like, 45 minutes long? That's a lot of space.

I don't know, maybe you could try putting some of the smaller ones on there, but not all of them. You'd be left with no space for anything else. And even if you did manage to fit them all, the phone would probably get really slow and stuff.

So, I'd say the answer is no, you can't save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on your Samsung Galaxy A10e.

**A) Yes**
**B) No**"

I mean, I've heard of all these city-states and stuff, but I don't think they were all connected like the states in the US. It's like, they were all separate and independent, you know? I'm pretty sure there were like, a lot more states in the US back then. So, I'd say the answer is... 

(A) Yes"

"Door-to-door advertising can be kinda annoying, but I don't think it's always inconsiderate. Some people like gettin' mail and stuff like that. It's like, if you're lookin' for a new pizza place or somethin', you might be happy to see a flyer or a person knockin' on your door. 

But, I guess if it's some weirdo or somethin', that's when it can be inconsiderate. Like if they're just standin' there, botherin' you, or if they're sellin' somethin' you don't need. That's when it's just plain rude.

So, I'd say door-to-door advertising isn't always inconsiderate, but it depends on the situation."
I don't think Alexander the Great was baptized.

"I don't think a white cockatoo could've lived through the Thirty Years' War. I mean, it was a really bad time in Europe, with lots of fighting and not much food. I've heard of birds getting sick or dying from the cold and lack of food. Plus, I don't think cockatoos are from Europe, they're from Australia or something. So, it's unlikely they would've been there."

"I think a deacon would probably be a fan of that podcast. They seem like the kinda person who can laugh at themselves and not take things too seriously.

"So, I was thinkin' about these two movies, Harry Potter and The Matrix. I don't really know much about 'em, but I've seen some of 'em.

Harry Potter is like, a kid's movie, right? It's about a kid who goes to school and fights bad guys. I think it's pretty popular, but I don't know if it's a good investment for the movie company.

The Matrix, on the other hand, is like, a sci-fi movie, right? It's about people livin' in a fake world and stuff. I liked it, but I don't know if it made a lot of money for the company.

I think Harry Potter made more money for Warner Bros. than The Matrix did. I mean, I've seen some of the Harry Potter movies, and they're pretty big deals. I don't know if The Matrix was as successful, but I think Harry Potter was.

So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"

Plus, you'd need a place to test it and make sure it's safe, and that's not something you can just do in a cave or something. It's just not possible."
"Horoscopes are made by people who are supposed to know about the stars and stuff. But I don't think astronomers do that. They're more into, like, studying the stars and planets and all that. They don't really care about what's going to happen to you in your love life or anything like that.

So, I think astronomers don't write horoscopes."

So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"

"So, I was wonderin' about these two guys, Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. They both had the same last name, but I don't think they were the same person.

Martin Luther was a German guy who lived a long time ago, and he was into religion. He did some stuff that made a lot of people upset with the church, and that's why he's famous. I think he was a Protestant or somethin'.

Martin Luther King Jr., on the other hand, was an American guy who was into civil rights. He was a preacher and he wanted to make sure everyone was treated fairly. He was a Baptist, I think.

"I don't think a Bengal cat could jump that high. I mean, I've seen them jump up onto the couch and stuff, but 8 feet? That's just crazy. I don't think any cat, no matter how fast or agile, can do that. They're just not built for it. So, the answer is:

(B) No"

I think I've heard of some kids driving to work, like to a part-time job or something, but I don't know if they have to be a certain age or if they need a special permit. I'm not really sure.

I'm gonna take a guess and say... (A) No."

"So, you're askin' if the Brazilian Navy coulda turned the tide in the Battle of Actium. Well, I gotta say, that's a pretty weird question. The Brazilian Navy didn't even exist back then, so it wouldn't have been able to do nothin' in the battle.

But, if we're just talkin' hypothetically, I guess it's possible that some other navy coulda made a difference. But, I mean, the Romans were a pretty powerful force back then, and it's hard to imagine anyone, even a modern navy, changin' the outcome of that battle.

So, the answer is... (A) No."
