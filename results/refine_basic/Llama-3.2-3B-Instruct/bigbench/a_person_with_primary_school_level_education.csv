"Let's solve the problem!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has a different flower in their house and plays a different instrument.

Clue 1: The flutist lives in the second house.

Clue 2: The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.

Clue 3: The person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement.

Clue 4: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

We know the flutist lives in house 2. The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. So, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 1.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 3.

Now, let's think about the pianist. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. So, the pianist must live in house 4.

Let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: person with the vase of tulips
- House 2: flutist
- House 3: person with the bouquet of lilies
- House 4: pianist

The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the guitarist can't live in house 1 (because the person with the vase of tulips lives there), the guitarist must live in house 3. But we already know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 3. This means the person with the bouquet of lilies must be the flutist, which is not true. 

However, rethinking clue 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the guitarist lives in house 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2, and the person with the carnations arrangement must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know again:
- House 1: person with the carnations arrangement
- House 2: person with the bouquet of lilies
- House 3: guitarist
- House 4: pianist

The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the guitarist lives in house 3, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who likes green lives in the first house. We also know that the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis.

The person who likes blue and has a gameboy lives directly next to the person who eats kiwis. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and has a gameboy must live in the second house.

We also know that there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. This means the cellist cannot live in the second house, as the person who likes blue and has a gameboy would occupy the second house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the third house.

The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, and the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy, the person who has a television must live in the first house.

The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, and the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy, the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy, the root beer lover must live in the first house.

The percussionist does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue and has a gameboy, the percussionist must live in the first house.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Percussionist (eating kiwis), drinking water, playing guitar, has a television
- House 2: Person who likes blue, drinking coffee, playing cello, has a gameboy
- House 3: Person who likes green, eating oranges, drinking root beer, playing percussion

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 5, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the fifth house (clue 15), the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who is eating apples lives in the first house. 

The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house. Since the person who had pizza lives in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must also live in the third house.

The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the fourth house.

The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, the person who drives a truck must live in the first house.

The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fourth house.

The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the second house.

The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house, the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

But we already know the person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house. So, the tea drinker must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, we can conclude that the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the root beer lover and the person who had stew. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. So, the root beer lover must live in the third house, and the person who had stew lives in the fourth house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, and the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

We have the following information so far:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives in the third house.
- The person who had stew lives in the fourth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
- The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The only remaining house is the first house, and the only remaining drink is milk. So, the person who likes milk lives in the first house.

The person who likes milk lives in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and has a different type of flower in their house.

Clue 1: The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges.

Clue 2: The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other.

Clue 3: The person with tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos.

Clue 4: The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

We can start by looking at Clue 4. The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person with daffodils can't live in house 1, because the soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges.

Now, let's think about Clue 2. The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other. This means they can't live in houses 1 and 2, because the person eating oranges lives in house 2. So, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must live in houses 2 and 3, or houses 3 and 1.

But wait! Clue 3 says the person with tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos. This means the person eating mangos can't live in house 3, because the person with daffodils lives in house 3. So, the person eating mangos must live in house 1.

Now we have the following:

- House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos)
- House 2: Person eating oranges
- House 3: Swimmer (eating bananas) and person with daffodils

So, the person with daffodils lives in house 3. The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the problem!

We know that there are 3 houses in a row. We need to figure out where each person lives and what they like.

From clue 7, we know that the person who plays the violin lives in the first house.

Clue 3 tells us that the person who has daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist. So, the person who plays the violin and has daffodils lives in the first house.

Clue 2 says that the person who had fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist. So, the person who plays the violin, has daffodils, and had fried rice lives in the first house.

Clue 4 says that the mystery book reader lives to the left of the science fiction book reader. Since the person who plays the violin lives in the first house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

Clue 5 says that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book reader lives. Since the person who plays the violin lives in the first house, the person who has a radio must live in the second house, and the history book reader must live in the third house.

Clue 6 says that the person who has tulips and the person who has a phone live next to each other. Since the person who plays the violin lives in the first house, the person who has tulips and the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

Clue 8 says that the history book reader lives to the right of the person who has tulips. Since the person who has tulips lives in the second house, the history book reader must live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: violinist (has daffodils)
- House 2: saxophonist (has tulips), person who has a phone
- House 3: percussionist (has fried rice), history book reader (has spaghetti)

The person who has tulips lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that each person has a different device, flowers, musical instrument, pet, and likes a different kind of book.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the bird keeper does not live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the mystery book reader lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the percussionist must live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the cellist does not live in the third house.

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: History book buff (has a bouquet of lilies) 
- House 2: Percussionist (has a computer) 
- House 3: Bird keeper (has a rose bouquet)

From clue 7, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the history book buff lives in the first house and the bird keeper lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house. However, we know the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. The correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person has a different fruit, pet, device, and flowers. We need to figure out who lives in each house.

From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, the person who is eating grapes lives in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second and fourth houses, in that order.

From clue 1, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. So, the fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who has a phone lives. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the fifth house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating apples lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the dog owner lives in the first house, the cat lover must live in the second house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the cat lover lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the cat lover lives in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the second house (because the cat lover lives there), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house.

From clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person who has a computer must live in the first house.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, the dog owner must live in the first house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house, so this is a problem. However, we can fix this by realizing the dog owner must live in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

1. Dog owner - Computer - Fish enthusiast - Carnations arrangement - Radio
2. Cat lover - Gameboy - Rose bouquet - Banana - 
3. Horse owner - 
4. Fish enthusiast - Carnations arrangement - Orange - Bouquet of lilies
5. Banana eater - Bouquet of daffodils - Phone

"Let's think about the clues.

There are two houses. One person lives in house 1 and one person lives in house 2. They all have different things:

- One person wears sandals and one person wears boots.
- One person likes mystery books and one person likes history books.
- One person drives a convertible and one person drives a truck.

The clues are:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book person.
2. The person who wears boots doesn't live in the first house.

So, the history book person can't live in house 1. The person who drives a convertible lives in house 1. The person who wears boots lives in house 2.

Now, let's think about the last two clues. The mystery book person can't live in house 2 because the history book person lives in house 2. The person who wears sandals can't be the history book person. So, the mystery book person must live in house 1.

The person who wears boots lives in house 2, and the person who drives a truck lives in house 2. The person who drives a convertible lives in house 1. The mystery book person lives in house 1.

So, the person who wears sandals lives in house 1.

Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.

Clue 4 says the swimmer doesn't live in the third house.

Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives in the third house. Clue 4 says the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house. Clue 5 says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

Let's start with Clue 5. The person wearing sandals lives left of the romance book lover. So, the order is: 
- Sandals
- Romance
- ?

Now, Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the order is: 
- Sandals
- Romance
- Mystery

Clue 2 says the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. But we don't know who wears loafers yet. Let's look at Clue 1. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or the fourth house. But Clue 4 says the person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Now, the order is: 
- High heels

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's think about it. If the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house, that means they can only live in the first or third house. But if they live in the first house, the person who likes green would have to live in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy would have to live in the third house. But then, the person who has a gameboy would live directly left of the person who has a computer, which means the person who has a computer would live in the third house. That's not possible because the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. Now, let's look at the clues again. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. If the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But then, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer, which means the person who has a computer lives in the second house.

10. The person with apples lives left of the person with mangos.

Let's start with the person with the rose. Since they live left of the person with grilled cheese, they must be in house 1.

The person with tulips doesn't live in the 5th house, so they must be in either house 2 or 3. Since the person with grilled cheese and tulips live next to each other, the tulips must be in house 2.

The person with grilled cheese lives right of the person with spaghetti, so the spaghetti must be in house 3.

The person with pizza lives left of the person with grilled cheese, so the pizza must be in house 1.

The person with grilled cheese and stew live next to each other, so the stew must be in house 4.

The person with oranges lives right of the person with carnations, so the carnations must be in house 1.

The person with oranges lives right of the person with kiwis, and there are 2 houses between them, so the kiwis must be in house 3.

The person with apples lives left of the person with mangos, so the mangos must be in house 5.

Now, let's summarize the order:

House 1: Carnations, oranges, pizza
House 2: Tulips
House 3: Spaghetti, kiwis, apples
House 4: Grilled cheese, stew
House 5: Mangos

The person who had stew lives in house 4."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 4 houses with people living in them. Each person has different pets and flowers. We need to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

Clue 1 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. The cat lover lives in the first house. So, the dog owner must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person with daffodils can't live in the second house. This means they can live in the first, third, or fourth house.

Clue 3 says there's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations. The horse owner can't live in the first or third house, so they must live in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. This means the horse owner lives in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person with daffodils. They can't live in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the fourth house. So, the person with daffodils must live in the third house.

The last clue says the cat lover lives in the first house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Horse owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Dog owner

The fish enthusiast lives in house 3. The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve the problem.

We have two houses. One house is on the left and the other is on the right. There are two people living in these houses. Each person has different shoes, pets, and devices.

The clues are:

1. The person with the phone lives in the first house.
2. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with the phone lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots can't live in the second house. So, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with the phone lives in the first house and the person wearing boots also lives in the first house, the person who owns horses and has a radio must live in the first house too.

Now, we know the following:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with boots
  - Person with horses
  - Person with radio

This leaves house 2 for the person with high heels and the dog owner.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle!

We have 3 houses and 3 people. Each person has different shoes, favorite colors, foods, and devices. We have 10 clues to figure out who lives in each house.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the third house.
3. The person who likes apples doesn't live in the first house.
4. The person who likes grapes lives to the right of the person who wears boots.
5. There's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone.
6. The person who wears loafers doesn't live in the third house.
7. The person who had pizza doesn't live in the second house.
8. The person who eats mangos lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
9. The person who wears loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
10. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

Let's start by placing the person who wears loafers. They can't live in the third house (clue 6). They can live in the first or second house. If they live in the first house, the person who has a computer can't live in the first house because they have to live next to the person who wears loafers (clue 9). So, the person who wears loafers must live in the second house.

Now, the person who has a computer lives in the second house, and the person who has a phone lives in the third house (clue 10).

The person who eats mangos lives to the left of the person who likes yellow (clue 8). The person who eats mangos can't live in the third house because the person who has a phone lives there. So, the person who eats mangos must live in the first house.

The person who likes apples can't live in the first house (clue 3). The person who eats apples can't live in the third house because the person who has a phone lives there (clue 10). So, the person who eats apples must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who eats grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. The person who eats grilled cheese can't live in the third house (clue 2). The person who eats grilled cheese can't live in the second house because the person who eats apples lives there. So, the person who eats grilled cheese must live in the first house.

The person who likes blue lives in the first house, but we already have the person who eats mangos in the first house. So, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

Now, let's summarize:

- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who wears loafers lives in the second house.
- The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
- The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
- The person who eats mangos lives in the first house.
- The person who eats apples lives in the second house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who eats grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- The person who wears boots lives in the second house.
- The person who likes grapes lives in the second house.
- The person who wears sandals lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that there are 4 houses with 4 people. Each person plays a different sport and has a different pet. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in each house.

Clue 1: The basketball player does not live in the first house.

Clue 2: The basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer.

Clue 3: The baseball player lives in the second house.

Clue 4: The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.

Clue 5: The bird keeper does not live in the first house.

Clue 6: The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.

Clue 7: The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's start by using Clue 3. We know the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the order for the first two houses is: 
- The tennis player lives in the first house.
- The cat lover lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover lives in the second house, and the tennis player lives in the first house. But we already knew that! So, we can move on to the next clue.

From Clue 2, we know the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer. We also know the basketball player does not live in the first house (Clue 1). This means the basketball player must live in the third house. The swimmer must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at Clue 4. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. We know the dog owner cannot live in the fourth house because the swimmer lives there. The dog owner must live in the third house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the fourth house.

We know the bird keeper does not live in the first house (Clue 5) and does not live in the third house (Clue 7). This means the bird keeper must live in the second house. But we already know the cat lover lives in the second house. This is a problem! We can't have two people in the same house. Let's look at Clue 6 again. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. This means the tennis player must live in the first house, and the cat lover must live in the second house. But we already knew that! This is a problem! We can't have two people in the same house.

Wait, let's look at Clue 5 again. The bird keeper does not live in the first house. This means the bird keeper must live in either the second or the third house. We know the cat lover lives in the second house, and the dog owner lives in the third house. The fish enthusiast lives in the fourth house. The only house left for the bird keeper is the first house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the first house."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person likes a different color, has a different car, plays a different instrument, has a different device, and plays a different sport.

From the clues, we can start by looking at the first clue: ""The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer."" This means the person who likes white can't live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or 3.

The second clue says, ""There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives."" This means the baseball player can't live in house 1, and the person who likes blue can't live in house 3. So, the baseball player must live in house 1, and the person who likes blue must live in house 2.

The third clue says, ""The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV."" This means the person who owns a sedan can't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. The person who owns an SUV must live in house 2.

The fourth clue says, ""The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV."" This means the swimmer can't live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or 3. But we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in house 2, so the swimmer must live in house 3.

The fifth clue says, ""The violinist does not live in the first house."" This means the violinist can live in either house 2 or 3. But we already know the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, and the person who owns an SUV lives in house 2. So, the violinist must live in house 3.

The sixth clue says, ""The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other."" This means the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy can't live in house 3, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, so the person who has a gameboy must live in house 1. This means the person who owns a sedan can't live in house 1, so they must live in house 2. But we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in house 2, so this is a problem. However, we can fix this by saying the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, and the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

The seventh clue says, ""The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white."" This means the guitarist can't live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or 3. But we already know the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, and the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2. So, the guitarist must live in house 3.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: Guitarist (owns a sedan, has a gameboy)
- House 2: Swimmer (owns a computer, owns an SUV)
- House 3: Violinist (likes blue)

The last clue says, ""There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives."" This means the baseball player can't live in house 3, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the guitarist lives in house 1, so this is a problem. However, we can fix this by saying the baseball player lives in house 2, and the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

Now we have the final arrangement:

- House 1: Baseball player (owns a sedan, has a gameboy)
- House 2: Swimmer (owns a computer, owns an SUV)
- House 3: Violinist (likes blue)

The soccer player lives in house 2. The correct answer is (C) 2."

"Let's figure out where the person with a television lives.

We know that the person with a television lives to the left of the person wearing high heels. The person wearing high heels lives next to the pianist. The pianist can't live in the first house. So, the person with a television can't live in the first house either.

The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis. The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots. The person wearing high heels lives next to the pianist, and the pianist can't live in the first house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in the third house.

The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 1). We know that the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2, so the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1, and the person who likes blue lives in house 3. The only person left is the person who likes green, and they must live in house 1.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this puzzle!

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person has different shoes and cars. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1: The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

Clue 2: The person who owns a sedan doesn't live in the third house.

Clue 3: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person wearing high heels.

Clue 4: The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person driving a convertible.

Clue 5: The person wearing running shoes and the person wearing boots live directly next to each other.

Clue 6: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, the person wearing running shoes and the person wearing boots live next to each other. They can't be in the first and second houses because the person wearing running shoes is already in the first house. They can't be in the third and fourth houses because the person owning an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, they must be in the second and third houses.

From Clue 3, the person driving a minivan lives left of the person wearing high heels. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person wearing high heels must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person wearing sandals lives left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person wearing high heels is in the third house, the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person owning a sedan doesn't live in the third house. Since the person wearing high heels is in the third house, the person owning a sedan must live in the first or fourth house. But the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, so the person owning a sedan must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person owning an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Now we have the order: 
- House 1: Person wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person wearing sandals
- House 3: Person wearing high heels
- House 4: Person owning a sedan and an SUV
- House 5: Person wearing boots

The person wearing boots lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"Let's solve the problem.

We know that the cricketer lives in the first house. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. So, the person who owns horses lives in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. This means the cat lover lives in the third house.

Now, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. We don't know who the basketball player is yet, but we know they can't live in the first or third house because the cricketer and the cat lover live in those houses.

So, the basketball player must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's solve the puzzle.

From clue 7, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 3, we know the saxophonist lives in the second house.

From clue 10, we know the tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the second house. But we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house, so the person who had stew must be the saxophonist. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's try again. From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second or first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first or second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the cellist must live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the cellist lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the flutist does not live in the fourth house. Since the flutist lives in the third house, the flutist must be the person who had pizza.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the flutist lives in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

Now, let's try to figure out who lives in each house.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk, so the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house. The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who is wearing loafers, so the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

The person who had stew lives in the second house, but we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house. So, the person who had stew must be the saxophonist. But we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. Let's try again.

The person who had stew lives in the second house, but we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house. So, the person who had stew must be the person who is wearing sandals.

"Let's solve the problem!

We know that the tea drinker lives in the first house. 

The person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person eating apples must be in the second house.

The person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person eating apples is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the person driving a convertible must be in the third house.

There is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the coffee drinker must be in the third house.

The person eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the person eating apples is in the second house, the person eating oranges must be in the first house, but this would mean the tea drinker is eating oranges, which is not true. So, the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Coffee drinker and person eating oranges

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 3."
"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person likes a different color and a different kind of book. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1: The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the order is: red, mystery, ? (we don't know what's in the third spot yet).

Clue 2: The fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast can live in either the second or the third house.

Clue 3: The person who likes white doesn't live in the third house. This means the person who likes white can live in either the first or the second house.

Clue 4: The person who likes red lives in the second house. This means the order is: ?, ?, red, mystery.

Now, let's think about Clue 3 again. Since the person who likes white can live in either the first or the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

So, the order is: white, ?, red, mystery. We know the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

The answer is: **3**"
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has different pets, cars, fruits, flowers, and likes books. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the cat lover doesn't live in the third house. That means the cat lover can live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the flowers. From clue 3, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, we know there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the bird keeper and the person who is eating oranges must live in the first and second houses, in that order.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a minivan must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in either the first or the second house.

Now, let's put it all together!

The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
The person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house.
The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
The person who has a bouquet of carnations lives in the second house.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that there are 3 houses in a row. We also know that each person has different characteristics like eating different fruits, having different flowers, playing different instruments, having different favorite drinks, and using different devices.

From clue 1, the person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the person who has a television can't live in the second house because the tea drinker can't live in the second house (clue 3). So, the person who has a television must live in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who has a television lives in the first house, the guitarist must live in the second house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the flutist can't live in the first house (because the person who has a television lives in the first house) and the person who is eating a banana can't live in the third house (because the tea drinker lives in the third house). So, the flutist must live in the second house, but this is already occupied by the guitarist. This means the flutist must live in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, the coffee drinker must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a radio lives in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house, but this is occupied by the guitarist. However, since the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person who has a radio, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house, but this is occupied by the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house is incorrect, and the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. Since the person who has a television lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person who has a television, coffee drinker, person who has a vase of tulips
- House 2: guitarist, person who is eating a banana
- House 3: person who is eating kiwis, person who is eating apples, tea drinker

The person who is eating apples lives in the third house, and the tea drinker lives in the third house. The person who is eating a banana lives in the second house.

The person who is eating a banana lives in the second house. The person who has a television lives in the first house. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, but we already know the history book buff lives in the second house. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must be the history book buff, which doesn't make sense. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, and the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct order of the houses is:
1. History book buff - eating mangos - wearing running shoes
2. Fantasy book enthusiast - eating kiwis - wearing boots
3. Science fiction book fanatic - eating apples - wearing high heels
4. Mystery book reader - eating banana - wearing sandals

The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house, which is house number 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."

Now we have the"
"Let's figure out where the violinist lives.

We know that the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

The person who only drinks water can't live in the first house, so they must live in house 2. This means the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.

The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has daffodils. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, so the person who has daffodils lives in house 2.

The cellist lives to the left of the saxophonist. The person who has daffodils lives in house 2, so the cellist lives in house 1.

The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who eats apples. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, so the person who eats apples lives in house 2.

The person who eats apples lives to the left of the violinist. The person who eats apples lives in house 2, so the violinist lives in house 3.

The person who has carnations lives in house 1, but not in house 3. The person who eats bananas lives in house 3.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: person who drives a minivan, person who owns a sedan, person who has carnations
- House 2: person who only drinks water, person who has daffodils, person who eats apples
- House 3: person who eats bananas, person who is a root beer lover, person who is a cellist, person who drives a minivan is not in house 3, so the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1, person who is a saxophonist lives in house 2, and the person who is a violinist lives in house 3.

"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We know that the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. We also know that the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. 

The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. The person who is wearing loafers lives to the right of the cat lover. The cat lover lives to the left of the dog owner. 

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house. The person who had stew lives to the right of the person who likes white. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the sixth house. The person who has a gameboy lives in the seventh house.

"Let's think about this problem.

We know that the person with a bouquet of lilies doesn't live in the first house. And the person with a television lives in the first house.

So, the person with lilies must live in the second house. Now, let's think about the devices. One person has a computer and one has a television. Since the person with a television lives in the first house, the person with a computer must live in the second house.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 2."

Since the person with daffodils is to the left of the golfer, the order is: science fiction book person, history book person, person with daffodils, golfer, and then the person who plays the guitar.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Science fiction book person: 1
- History book person: 2
- Person with daffodils: 1
- Golfer: 2
- Guitarist: 2

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, and the person who had spaghetti must be in house 2. Since the history book person lives in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 1, and the person who had spaghetti must be in house 2.

The correct order is:
- House 1: science fiction book person, pizza eater
- House 2: history book person, person with daffodils, person who had spaghetti

The person who plays the drums must be in house 1."

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 2 houses. We know some things about the people living in them:

- One person has a rose bouquet.
- One person has lilies.
- One person is eating apples.
- One person is eating oranges.
- One person is a swimmer.
- One person is a basketball player.
- One person has a radio.
- One person has a computer.
- One person plays the piano.
- One person plays the violin.

We have some clues:

1. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player doesn't live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with lilies lives in house 1. From clue 4, the basketball player lives in house 2. 

Now, let's think about clue 1. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. Since the basketball player lives in house 2, the person eating apples must live in house 1. But we already know the person with lilies lives in house 1, so the person eating apples must be the person with lilies. This means the person with the radio lives in house 2.

From clue 2, the person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person with the radio lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 1.

So, the violinist lives in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the tennis player lives in the third house. 

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

The golfer lives in the fourth house.

There's one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. But we already know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. This means our first guess was wrong. The person who ate fried rice must live in the first house, and the person who had stew lives in the second house.

Now we have the following order: 
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the second house.
- The tennis player lives in the third house.
- The golfer lives in the fourth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

2. The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), so the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other (clue 3), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. So, the baseball player must live in the first house.

The person who only drinks water lives in the second house, because the baseball player lives in the first house. The person who only drinks water can't live in the first house, because the baseball player lives there.

Now, let's think about the remaining clues. The person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person wearing running shoes can't live in the first house (clue 1), so the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

The person who likes red must live in the first house, because the person who likes white lives in the first house. The person wearing loafers must live in the first house, because the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think about the clues.

We know that the person eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who drinks coffee. We also know that the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.

The root beer lover can't live in the second house. And the person eating oranges can't live in the second house either.

So, the root beer lover can live in either the first or the third house. The person eating oranges can live in either the first or the third house.

The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means the coffee drinker must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

Since the person eating oranges can't live in the second house, and the coffee drinker lives in the first house, the person eating oranges must live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2."

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

Now, we know the order of houses is: 
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: ? (Fried rice)

Clue 1 says the person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the second house. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

So, the order of houses is: 
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried rice

The person who is wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

"There are 2 houses next to each other, numbered 1 on the left and 2 on the right. There is one person living in each house. The people in these houses have different characteristics:

- Everyone likes a different kind of book: one is a mystery book reader and one is a fantasy book enthusiast
- Each person plays a different sport: one is a tennis player and one is a golfer

Clue 1: The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
Clue 2: The tennis player does not live in the first house.

We know the mystery book reader lives in house 1. The tennis player can't live in house 1, so the tennis player must live in house 2. 

Now, we need to find out where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. The fantasy book enthusiast can't live in house 1 (because the mystery book reader lives there) and can't live in house 2 (because the tennis player lives there). So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has a different favorite color, eats a different food, plays a different instrument, and wears different shoes. We need to figure out who lives in each house.

From clue 1, we know that the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 2, we know that the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 3, we know that the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know that the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 5, we know that the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.

From clue 6, we know that the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From clue 7, we know that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.

From clue 8, we know that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know that there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 10, we know that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From clue 11, we know that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 12, we know that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.

From clue 13, we know that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

Let's start from the end and work our way inwards.

The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.

The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, let's try to fit the people into the houses.

House 1: 
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the first house. 
- The person who is wearing sandals is wearing boots. 
- The person who is wearing boots is the person who had stew. 
- The person who had stew is the person who likes green. 
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.

House 2: 
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. 
- The person who is wearing loafers is the person who likes blue. 
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house.

House 3: 
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. 
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist. 
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house. 
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies is the person who likes white. 
- The person who likes white lives in the third house.

House 4: 
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. 
- The person who is wearing running shoes is the person who had pizza. 
- The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. 
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house. 
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils is the person who likes yellow. 
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

Now, we have the following order: 
- The person who likes green lives in the first house. 
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house. 
- The person who likes white lives in the third house. 
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 3."

From clue 3, we know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the third house (clue 4), the person who likes red must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who likes red lives in the fourth house (clue 3), so the person who ate fried rice must be the person who likes red.

Clue 2: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.

Clue 3: The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.

Clue 4: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

Now, let's think about Clue 3. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

We know the order of the houses so far: 
- The person who likes blue (2nd house)
- The person who is eating kiwis (3rd house)

Now, let's think about Clue 4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house. But wait, that's the person who likes blue! So, we need to move the person who likes blue to the third house, and the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

Now we have: 
- The person who is eating apples (2nd house)
- The person who likes blue (3rd house)
- The person who is eating kiwis (3rd house)

We still need to figure out who likes green. Clue 1 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the second house. But we already have the person who is eating apples in the second house! So, the person who likes white must be the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis must be the person who likes green.

Now we have: 
- The person who is eating apples (2nd house) - likes white
- The person who likes blue (3rd house)

Now, the mystery book reader can't be in house 1 because the soccer player is already there. So, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

The person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 1 because the root beer lover lives to the right of them. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 2.

Now, let's look at Clue 2. If there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner, and the truck owner lives in house 1, then the dog owner must live in house 4.

Clue 4 says the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. So, the fish enthusiast must live in house 3.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. So, the cricketer lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes white lives in the third house.

The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. They can't live in the third house because the person who likes white lives there. So, they must live in the fourth and fifth houses. But the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house, so the golfer must live in the fourth house, and the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.

The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. The tennis player lives in the sixth house. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.

"Let's think about the clues.

The cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2. This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

The dog owner doesn't live in the first house. So, the dog owner must live in house 2.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

House 1: Minivan (Clue 2)
House 2: ? (we don't know yet)
House 3: Gameboy (Clue 1)
House 4: ? (we don't know yet)

We know the person who drives a convertible doesn't live in the third house (Clue 5), so they must live in either house 1 or 4. We also know the person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy (Clue 4), so the person who has a radio must live in house 4.

Now, let's think about the person who has a phone. They live directly left of the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3). We don't know who owns an SUV yet, but we know they can't live in house 1 (Clue 6) or house 3 (Clue 1). So, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 2.

The person who has a phone must live in house 1, because that's the only house left. The person who has a radio lives in house 4, and the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2.

"Let's solve the problem!

We have 5 clues:

1. The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other.
2. The person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The root beer lover doesn't live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the person who has a computer.

We can start by looking at clue 1. The person with the radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other. This means they can be in either house 1 or house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. If the person with the radio is in house 1, then the person who had pizza must be in house 2. But we can't have the root beer lover in house 2 (clue 3), so the person with the radio must be in house 1.

Now, let's look at clue 4. The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the person with the radio is in house 1, the person with the computer must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person with the radio, person who drives a truck, and person who had pizza
- House 2: Person with the computer, person who is eating grapes, and root beer lover

The person who had pizza lives in house 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person likes something different: grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. They also like different colors: red, yellow, white, and green. And they drink different things: coffee, tea, water, and milk.

Clue 1: The tea drinker lives in the first house.

Clue 2: The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Clue 3: The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

The order so far is:

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person has a favorite drink, eats a different fruit, wears different shoes, plays a different sport, and has a different flower in their foyer.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes milk. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes milk. This means the swimmer and the person who likes milk can't be in the first and second houses.

Clue 2 says the person who is eating oranges doesn't live in the third house. Clue 3 says the person who is eating mangos doesn't live in the first house. Clue 11 says the baseball player lives in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating oranges must live in the first or last house, and the person who is eating mangos must live in the second or last house.

Clue 4 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house. Clue 7 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is wearing running shoes can't be in the first or second house.

Clue 8 says the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Clue 9 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Clue 18 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the first and second houses, in that order.

Clue 10 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Clue 12 says there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. This means the cricketer must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

Clue 13 says the person who is eating mangos doesn't live in the third house. Clue 14 says the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the tea drinker. Clue 16 says the swimmer lives directly left of the golfer. This means the tea drinker must be in the second house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fifth house.

Clue 15 says the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. Clue 17 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes must be in the fifth house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating mangos lives in the last house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. The answer is (C)."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person plays a different sport, eats a different food, and has a different flower in their house.

Clue 1: The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.

Clue 2: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Clue 3: The soccer player lives in the third house.

Clue 4: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Clue 5: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

Let's start by using Clue 3. We know the soccer player lives in the third house. 

Now, let's look at Clue 1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. Since the soccer player lives in the third house, the golfer must live in the second house, and the basketball player must live in the first house.

Now, let's look at Clue 2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the golfer lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

But wait! We already know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be the person with the bouquet of lilies. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. Since the soccer player lives in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first or second house.

We already know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must be the person who ate grilled cheese.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the person who likes red lives in the third house. This is because the pianist lives in the third house (clue 3) and the person who likes red is the pianist (clue 7).

We also know that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, but we can't put them there yet because the pianist is already in the third house. So, we'll move on to the next clue.

From clue 9, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, but we already know that's where the pianist lives. This means we need to find another house for the person who ate fried rice.

Let's look at clue 8. It says there are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. We know the person who likes white lives in the first house (because the person who ate fried rice can't live in the first house, and the person who likes red is already in the third house). So, the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house.

Now, let's look at clue 12. It says the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who had pizza lives in the sixth house.

We know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow (clue 4). So, the person who had stew lives in the fourth house.

We also know the person who likes green doesn't live in the fourth house (clue 5). This means the person who likes green must live in the second house.

Now we have the following order: 
1. person who likes white
2. person who likes green
3. person who likes red (pianist)
4. person who had stew
5. person who likes yellow
6. person who had pizza
7. person who likes blue
8. person who likes saxophone
9. person who likes percussion
10. person who likes cellist

The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, but we know that's where the pianist lives. Wait, no! We made a mistake! The person who ate fried rice can't live in the third house. Let's look at clue 10. It says the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other. This means the person who likes percussion and the person who likes cellist must live in the 9th and 10th houses, or the 10th and 11th houses. But we know the person who likes blue lives in the 7th house, so the person who likes percussion and the person who likes cellist must live in the 9th and 10th houses.

Now we have the following order: 
1. person who likes white
2. person who likes green
3. person who likes red (pianist)
4. person who had stew
5. person who likes yellow
6. person who had pizza
7. person who likes blue
8. person who likes saxophone
9. person who likes percussion
10. person who likes cellist
11. person who ate fried rice

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the 11th house."
"Let's solve the puzzle.

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has different shoes, food, and drinks. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in the third house (clue 1). We can then place the person who had stew to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2). Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5), we can place the person who is wearing running shoes to the left of the tea drinker.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: ? 
- House 2: ?

We know the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (clue 6). Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house (clue 7), we can place the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must live in houses 3 and 4, but since the tea drinker is already in house 3, the person who only drinks water must live in house 4.

"Let's solve this puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has different things like shoes, drinks, devices, and food. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes milk lives to the right of the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker can't be in the last house.

From clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the gameboy person can't be in the last house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover doesn't live in the first house. This means the root beer lover can live in the second or third house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who has a computer. This means the boots person can't be in the last house.

From clue 5, the person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the basketball player lives in the last house.

From clue 7, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the stew person can't be in the last house.

From clue 8, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live next to each other. This means they can't be in the last house.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who has a radio. This means the root beer lover can't be in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who is wearing high heels. This means the milk person can't be in the last house.

From clue 11, the cricketer lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. This means the loafers person is the cricketer.

From clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who had stew. This means the spaghetti person can't be in the last house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who has a radio lives in the third house (clue 5).
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house (clue 12).
- The cricketer lives in the third house (clue 11).
- The person who has a computer lives next to the soccer player (clue 8).
- The soccer player lives in the last house (clue 6).
- The person who has a computer lives in the second house (because the soccer player lives in the last house).

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 2."
"There are two houses next to each other. One house is number 1 and the other is number 2. There are two people living in these houses. They ate different foods for lunch: one had pizza and the other had fried rice. They also like different kinds of books: one likes science fiction and the other likes history.

The person who had fried rice lives in the house to the right of the person who likes science fiction. Since there are only two houses, the person who had fried rice must live in house number 2.

We know that the person who had pizza lives in house number 1. The person who likes science fiction must live in house number 1 because the person who had fried rice lives in house number 2.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house number 1."

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives in house 1. Since the pianist plays a musical instrument, and the only two options are violin and piano, the pianist must be the violinist.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white does not live in house 2. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1. Since the pianist (violinist) lives in house 1, the person who likes white must be the dog owner.

Now, let's think about clue 2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner (who likes white) lives in house 1, the root beer lover must live in house 2. The person who owns horses must live in house 2, as the root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who had stew lives in the second house. 

The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic can't live in the fourth house because the person who had pizza lives there. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first or second house. But the person who had stew lives in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, so the percussionist must live to the right of the guitarist. This means the guitarist can't live in the second house. The guitarist can live in the first or third house. But the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, so the guitarist must live in the third house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the person who ate fried rice can't live in the fourth house. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. But we already know the guitarist lives in the third house, so the person who ate fried rice can't live in the third house. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house. But we already know the person who had stew lives in the second house, so this is a problem. However, we can see that the person who ate fried rice can't live in the second house. The person who had stew lives in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice can't live in the second house. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. The percussionist lives in the third house, so the history book buff must live in the fourth house. But the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the history book buff can't live in the fourth house. This means the history book buff must live in the third house. But we already know the guitarist lives in the third house, so the history book buff can't live in the third house. This means the history book buff must live in the fourth house. But we already know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the history book buff can't live in the fourth house. This is a problem.

- The first house has a carnations arrangement, the person who likes white, and the science fiction book fanatic (no, wait, that's not right...).
- The second house has the science fiction book fanatic, the person who likes white, and the person who is wearing boots.

3. The person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the romance book lover.

Let's start with clue 4. We know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 2. The romance book lover lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff. If the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. But that would mean the person who likes yellow and the person who likes green are in the same house. That's not possible. So, the person who likes green must live in the third house.

Clue 3 says the person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, so the person who had pizza must live in either the second or third house.

Clue 5 says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

Now we have the order:

Let's start by putting the tennis player and the person with a television. Since the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television, we can start with: 
Tennis player - Television - ?

Now, we know the golfer doesn't live in the second house, so the golfer must live in either the first or the third house.

The person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other. They can't be in the first house because the tennis player is already there. So, they must live in the third house.

Now we have:

The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet, the rose bouquet person must be in the second house.

"Let's solve the problem!

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different musical instrument. We need to figure out who lives in each house.

From the clues, we know:

1. The romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There's one house between the history book buff and the guitarist.
3. There's one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader.
4. The percussionist lives directly to the left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and violinist live next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

Let's start with clue 5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at clue 4. The percussionist lives to the left of the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the percussionist must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says there's one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the percussionist lives in the third house, the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

Clue 6 says the saxophonist and violinist live next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the third house.

Now we have the following order: 
- Mystery book reader: 4th house
- Percussionist: 3rd house
- Saxophonist: 4th house
- Violinist: 3rd house

The only person left is the romance book lover. Since the percussionist lives to the left of the romance book lover, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

The correct order is: 
- Romance book lover: 2nd house
- Violinist: 3rd house
- Percussionist: 3rd house
- Saxophonist: 4th house
- Mystery book reader: 5th house

The violinist lives in the 3rd house."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have 4 houses and 4 people. Each person has a different device (radio, phone, television, or gameboy) and wears different shoes (boots, sandals, loafers, or running shoes).

From Clue 1, we know the person with the television lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 2, we know the person with loafers lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know the person with the phone does not live in the second house. So, they can live in the first, third, or fourth house.

From Clue 4, we know the person with boots lives to the left of the person with loafers. Since the person with loafers lives in the second house, the person with boots must live in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with sandals. Since the person with boots lives in the first house, the person with the radio must live in the third house, and the person with sandals must live in the fifth house.

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses and 3 people. Each person likes a different drink and wears different shoes. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1: The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

Clue 2: The coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house.

Clue 3: The person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house.

Clue 4: The coffee drinker doesn't live in the first house.

Clue 5: The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house. So, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the coffee drinker doesn't live in the first house. So, the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

From Clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house. And we already know the person wearing running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Now, we have some information:
- The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- The person wearing running shoes (coffee drinker) lives in the third house.
- The person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this problem.

We know that the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. So, they must live in the second house.

Now, we have two people left: one who likes history books and one who likes mystery books. The person who likes history books lives in the first house, and the person who likes mystery books lives in the second house.

Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the answer is:

(B) 2"

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 3 houses and 3 people. Each person likes a different kind of book, eats a different food, and has a different favorite color. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

"Let's solve the problem.

We know that:
- There are 2 houses.
- One person plays the piano and one plays the cello.
- One person likes red and one likes green.
- One person likes mystery books and one likes fantasy books.

Clue 1: The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house.

Clue 3: The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From Clue 1, we know the fantasy book person lives in house 1. From Clue 2, we know the cello player also lives in house 1. Since the cello player lives in house 1, the fantasy book person must be the one who likes red.

Now, from Clue 3, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book person (who likes red) lives in house 1, the person who likes green must live in house 2.

The only person left is the mystery book reader. They must live in house 1, because house 2 is already taken by the person who likes green.

So, the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's think about the clues.

We know that the history book buff lives in the first house. 

The golfer lives in the second house. 

There's one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

So, the swimmer can't live in the first house (because the history book buff lives there) or the third house (because there needs to be one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic). 

That means the swimmer must live in the second house. But we already know the golfer lives in the second house.

"Let's solve the problem.

We have two houses. One person in each house has different things:

- They ate different foods: fried rice and spaghetti
- They have different pets: one has a cat, and one has horses
- They like different books: one likes history, and one likes romance
- They wear different shoes: one has sandals, and one has running shoes

We have some clues:

1. The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history lives to the right of the person who eats spaghetti.

We know the person who has horses lives in house 2. So, the person who eats spaghetti must live in house 1.

Now, let's think about the other things:

- One person likes cats, and one person likes horses. Since the person who has horses lives in house 2, the cat lover must live in house 1.
- One person likes history, and one person likes romance. The person who likes history lives to the right of the person who eats spaghetti (house 1). So, the history lover must live in house 2.

We have the following:

- House 1: cat lover, eats spaghetti, wears sandals
- House 2: history lover, has horses, wears running shoes

The person who eats fried rice must live in house 1. So, the correct answer is:

(B) 1"
"Let's think about the clues.

We know that the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies can't live in the first house. 

We also know that the flutist doesn't live in the first house. So, the flutist must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the cars. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. If the flutist lives in the second house, then the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house. But the person who has a bouquet of lilies can't live in the first house. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 3, we know the person with carnations lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the golfer must live in the third house, but this is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet. So, the golfer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house, but this is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house, and the swimmer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know there is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. Since the swimmer lives in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house, but this is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet. So, the mystery book reader must live in the second house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at the options for the mystery book reader's house. We know the mystery book reader lives in the second house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house. The only option left for the mystery book reader is house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

From clue 16, we know the person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.

From clue 17, we know the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

Let's start by placing the coffee drinker in the third house (clue 3). We can then place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils to the right of the coffee drinker (clue 4). This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house.

We can then place the person who has a rose bouquet to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 2). This means the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

We can then place the person who has a carnations arrangement to the left of the percussionist (clue 12). This means the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house.

We can then place the person who has a gameboy to the left of the person who has a computer (clue 5). This means the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house.

We can then place the person who has a radio to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 4). This means the person who has a radio lives in the fifth house.

We can then place the person who has a vase of tulips to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 10). This means the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

We can then place the person who has a television to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 15). This means the person who has a television lives in the fifth house.

We can then place the person who has a computer to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 11). This means the person who has a computer lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's look at the options. We know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house (clue 10). We also know the person who has a television lives in the fifth house (clue 15). We can eliminate option (A) 1 and (B) 3 because the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a television cannot live in the same house.

We can also eliminate option (C) 1 because the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

We are left with options (D) 4 and (E) 5. We know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house (clue 10). We also know the person who has a television lives in the fifth house (clue 15). We can eliminate option (D) 4 because the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a television cannot live in the same house.

"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

We know that the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

We also know that the golfer lives in the first house (clue 8). The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (clue 3). So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second or third house. But we already know the person wearing boots lives in the second house, so the person wearing running shoes must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. We don't know who has a rose bouquet yet, but we know the person who had pizza lives in the second or third house. We also know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, so the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. We don't know who owns a sedan yet, but we know the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 9. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first or third house. We know the person who had pizza lives in the second house, so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

So, we have:

- The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

The only house left is the first house, and the only person left is the golfer. So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house, which is option B."
"Let's solve this puzzle!

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person likes something different: a favorite drink, a musical instrument, a food, a color, and we have to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the coffee drinker can't live in house 5 (because the person who had pizza lives in house 5). So, the coffee drinker must live in house 4.

From clue 9, we know the coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the percussionist must live in house 5.

From clue 5, we know the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4.

From clue 4, we know the saxophonist lives in the third house. This means the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti can't be in houses 3 and 4, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker lives in house 4, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must live in houses 2 and 3.

From clue 12, we know there is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives. Since the percussionist lives in house 5, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1, and the root beer lover must live in house 4.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

From clue 8, we know the flutist lives in the second house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the flutist must live in house 2.

From clue 10, we know the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist lives in house 5, the root beer lover must live in house 1.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes milk lives in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1, but we already know the root beer lover lives in house 1, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

Now, let's look at the houses again:

- House 1: root beer lover, person who likes yellow, person who likes red, person who ate fried rice, person who ate spaghetti
- House 2: flutist, person who likes milk, person who had stew, person who only drinks water
- House 3: saxophonist, person who ate grilled cheese, cellist, person who had pizza
- House 4: coffee drinker, percussionist
- House 5: person who likes blue

The person who lives in house 5 is the percussionist. The answer is (B) 5."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know there are 5 houses and 5 people. Each person likes a different color and eats a different food. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the second house. This means the person who likes green can't live in the second house either.

Clue 3 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the fourth house. Clue 4 says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Clue 6 says the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. Clue 7 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

Clue 8 says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start with Clue 7. We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. Now, let's look at Clue 4. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in either the first or second house.

Clue 2 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Clue 6 says the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 8. There's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house and the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the fourth house.

Clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fifth house.

The only house left is the second house, which is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

So, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person likes a different color (red, yellow, and green), plays a different musical instrument (percussion, piano, and violin), and plays a different sport (baseball, tennis, and basketball).

We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in each house:

1. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

Let's start by using Clue 5. We know the percussionist lives in the second house. Clue 4 says the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or third house.

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. If the basketball player lived in the first house, the violinist would have to live in the second house, but we already know the percussionist lives in the second house. So, the basketball player can't live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the basketball player and the violinist must live in the first and second houses.

Now, let's think about Clue 3. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. Since the basketball player lives in the first house, the tennis player must live in the second house. But we already know the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the percussionist must be the tennis player!

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Tennis player (percussionist)
- House 3: Violinist

The basketball player lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the basketball player lives in the first house. The saxophonist lives in the first house too, so the saxophonist is the basketball player.

We also know that the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the saxophonist is the basketball player, the dog owner must live in the third house.

There's one house between the cat lover and the guitarist. The dog owner lives in the third house, so the cat lover must live in the second house, and the guitarist must live in the first house.

The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. The guitarist lives in the first house, so the tea drinker must live in the second house, and the cricketer must live in the third house.

The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. The dog owner lives in the third house, and the person who likes milk can't live in the third house because the dog owner lives there. So, the person who had stew must live in the first or second house. But the fish enthusiast lives in the first house, and the guitarist lives in the first house too. So, the person who had stew must live in the second house.

Now we have the following order: 
- Fish enthusiast (1)
- Guitarist (2)
- Tea drinker (3)
- Stew eater (4)
- Dog owner (5)

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 2 houses. We know some things about the people living in them:

- Each person has different pets: one is a cat lover and one is a fish enthusiast.
- Each person has a different device: one has a computer and one has a radio.
- Everyone likes a different kind of book: one is a romance book lover and one is a history book buff.
- Each person has different flowers in their foyer: one has a bouquet of lilies and one has a bouquet of daffodils.
- Each person is wearing different shoes: one is wearing high heels and one is wearing loafers.

We have some clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.

Let's think about it:

- The history book buff lives in the first house. That means the person wearing high heels also lives in the first house.
- The cat lover can't live in the second house, so the cat lover lives in the first house.
- The person wearing high heels (history book buff) and the cat lover live in the first house. That means the person with a computer lives in the second house.
- The person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer, so the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person plays a different instrument and eats a different fruit. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1: The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.

Clue 2: The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.

Clue 3: There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.

Clue 4: There's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

Let's think about it:

- The person eating grapes can't be in house 3 because there's no house between them and the person eating kiwis. So, they must be in house 1.
- The violinist can't be in house 1 because there's no house between them and the person eating kiwis. So, they must be in house 2.
- The person eating kiwis can't be in house 2 because the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. So, they must be in house 3.
- The pianist lives next to the person eating kiwis, so they must be in house 1.

So, the pianist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about this problem.

We know that the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. We also know that the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. We also know that the person who likes red lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the bird keeper and the person who has a television can't live in the first house. They must live in the second and third houses. But the person who likes red lives in the third house, so the bird keeper must live in the second house.

Now, we know the order is: 
- House 1: person who likes yellow
- House 2: bird keeper, person who has a television
- House 3: person who likes red
- House 4: ? 

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. We don't know who the dog owner is yet, but we know they can't live in the first house because the person who likes yellow lives there. We also know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house. But the bird keeper lives in the second house, so the dog owner must be the person who has a radio. 

Now, we know the order is: 
- House 1: person who likes yellow
- House 2: bird keeper, dog owner, person who has a radio
- House 3: person who likes red
- House 4: ? 

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. 

Now, we know the order is: 
- House 1: person who likes yellow
- House 2: bird keeper, person who has a television
- House 3: person who ate fried rice, person who has a radio
- House 4: person who ate grilled cheese

The person who likes red lives in the third house. 

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's think about the houses and the people who live there.

We know that the root beer lover doesn't live in the second house. So, the root beer lover must live in the first house. 

Now, we have to think about the people who play musical instruments. There's a pianist and a cellist. The pianist lives directly to the left of the cellist. If the root beer lover lives in the first house, then the pianist must live in the first house too. But that means the cellist can't live in the first house. So, the cellist must live in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have 5 houses with 5 people. Each person has different shoes and flowers in their house. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing boots and the person who has carnations live next to each other. This means they can't be in the first or last house. They must be in the 2nd or 4th house.

From clue 3, we know the person who has tulips lives to the right of the person who has daffodils. This means the person who has daffodils can't be in the 5th house. They must be in the 2nd or 3rd house.

From clue 4, we know there's one house between the person who has running shoes and the person who has lilies. This means the person who has lilies can't be in the 1st or 5th house. They must be in the 2nd or 4th house.

From clue 5, we know the person who has tulips lives to the right of the person who has daffodils. This means the person who has tulips can't be in the 2nd house (because the person who has lilies lives in the 2nd house). They must be in the 4th or 5th house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has tulips doesn't live in the 4th house. This means the person who has tulips must live in the 5th house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house.

Now we have some clues to figure out the order:

- The person who has carnations lives in the 5th house.
- The person who has tulips lives in the 5th house.
- The person who has boots lives next to the person who has carnations.
- The person who has daffodils lives in the 2nd or 3rd house.
- The person who has lilies lives in the 2nd or 4th house.
- The person who has running shoes lives next to the person who has daffodils.

Let's try to fit everything together:

- House 1: ? (person wearing sandals)
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations

Since the person who has boots lives next to the person who has carnations, and the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house, the person who has boots must live in the 4th house.

Now we have:

- House 1: ? (person wearing sandals)
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations

The person who has tulips lives in the 5th house, but we don't know who it is yet. The person who has running shoes lives next to the person who has daffodils, and the person who has daffodils lives in the 3rd house. The person who has lilies lives in the 2nd house.

The only person left is the person wearing sandals. They can't live in the 5th house (because the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house), so they must live in the 1st house.

Now we have:

- House 1: person wearing sandals
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations

The person who has tulips lives in the 5th house, and the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house. The person who has tulips must be the person wearing carnations. But we know the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house, so the person who has tulips must be the person wearing boots.

The person who has boots lives in the 4th house, and the person who has lilies lives in the 2nd house. The person who has daffodils lives in the 3rd house, and the person who has running shoes lives next to the person who has daffodils.

The only person left is the person wearing high heels. They must live in the 1st house.

Now we have:

- House 1: person wearing high heels
- House 2: person wearing lilies
- House 3: person wearing daffodils and running shoes
- House 4: person wearing boots
- House 5: person wearing carnations

The person who has lilies lives in the 2nd house, the person who has daffodils lives in the 3rd house, and the person who has running shoes lives next to the person who has daffodils. The person who has running shoes must be the person wearing loafers.

The person who has boots lives in the 4th house, and the person who has carnations lives in the 5th house.

The person who has tulips lives in the 5th house, but we don't know who it is yet. The person who has tulips must be the person wearing loafers.

The person who has tulips is the person wearing loafers, and the person wearing loafers lives in the 3rd house. The person who has daffodils lives in the 3rd house, and the person who has running shoes lives next to the person who has daffodils.

The person who has tulips"
"Let's solve the puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has a favorite color, a favorite drink, a favorite sport, and a favorite instrument. We need to figure out who lives in each house.

From clue 1, we know there are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the person who likes blue can't be in house 1 or house 4.

From clue 2, we know the baseball player doesn't live in house 2. This means the baseball player can live in house 1, house 3, or house 4.

From clue 3, we know the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who only drinks water can't live in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer can live in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 5, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player can live in house 3 or house 4.

From clue 6, we know there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist can live in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist can live in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who likes blue can't live in house 1 or house 4.

From clue 9, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker can live in house 3 or house 4.

From clue 10, we know the swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means they can live in houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4.

From clue 11, we know the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist can live in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 12, we know the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue can live in house 1 or house 2.

Now, let's try to figure it out!

If the swimmer and the person who likes white live in houses 1 and 2, the person who likes blue can't live in house 1 (because there are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives). So, the person who likes blue must live in house 2. The person who likes white must live in house 1. The person who only drinks water can't live in house 1 (because the person who likes white lives there), so they must live in house 3. The tennis player can live in house 4.

But wait! The person who is eating grapes must live in house 2, and there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player can't live in house 4. So, the tennis player must live in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must live in house 2.

Now, we have a problem! The person who likes blue lives in house 2, the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 3, and the tennis player lives in house 3. But the person who is eating grapes lives in house 2, and the percussionist can live in house 1 or house 2. This means the percussionist must live in house 1.

But we still have a problem! The person who likes blue lives in house 2, and the percussionist lives in house 1. This means the person who likes blue can't live in house 2. So, the person who likes blue must live in house 1.

Now, we have a solution!

The person who likes blue lives in house 1, the percussionist lives in house 1, the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 3, the tennis player lives in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes lives in house 4.

But we still have to figure out who lives in house 4. From clue 5, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player can live in house 3 or house 4. But we already know the tennis player lives in house 3. So, the tennis player must live in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must live in house 4.

The person who likes blue lives in house 1, the percussionist lives in house 1, the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 3, the tennis player lives in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes lives in house 4.

"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person likes something different: spaghetti, fried rice, and stew. They also like different colors: white, green, and red. And they wear different shoes: boots, running shoes, and high heels.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person who wears high heels doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who eats spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who wears high heels.
6. The person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who eats stew.
7. The person who eats stew doesn't live in the second house.

Let's figure it out!

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who eats spaghetti doesn't live in the second house. So, they must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. And from clue 6, we know the person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who eats stew. This means the person who wears boots must live in the first house, and the person who eats stew must live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Person who likes white, wearing boots, eating spaghetti
- House 2: Person who likes green, eating fried rice
- House 3: Person who likes red, wearing high heels, eating stew

So, the person who eats fried rice lives in the second house. The correct answer is (A) 2."

From clue 5, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, but we've already placed the romance book lover in the second house. This means our current arrangement is incorrect.

Let's try again. From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1 or house 2.

From clue 4, the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

"Let's think about the clues.

We know that the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. That means house 1 has a science fiction book lover.

We also know that the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. So, the coffee drinker must live in house 1, because house 1 already has a science fiction book lover.

Now, we have to think about the person wearing sandals. Since the coffee drinker lives in house 1, the person wearing sandals must live in house 2.

The only person left is the romance book lover. They can't live in house 1 because that's where the science fiction book lover lives, and they can't live in house 2 because that's where the person wearing sandals lives. So, the romance book lover must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about this problem.

We know that there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house who plays a different musical instrument: one plays the piano and one plays the drums. There's also a person in each house who has a different device: one has a radio and one has a phone.

The clue says that the person who plays the drums lives directly to the left of the person who has the radio. This means the person who plays the drums lives in the house on the left, and the person who has the radio lives in the house on the right.

Now, let's think about the devices. We know the person who plays the drums has a phone, and the person who has the radio has a piano. So, the person who plays the drums lives in house 1, and the person who has the radio lives in house 2.

The person who plays the piano lives in house 1, and the person who has the phone lives in house 2.

So, the person who has the phone lives in house 2."
"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses. We know some things about the people living in them:

- Each person likes a different color: white, blue, and yellow.
- Each person has a different kind of car: minivan, convertible, and sedan.

Clue 1: The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

Clue 2: There's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.

Clue 3: The person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

We know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in house 3.

Now, let's think about Clue 2. It says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

But we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. So, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Now, let's think about Clue 3. It says the person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Wait, we already know the person who likes white lives in house 1. So, the person who likes yellow must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person ate something different for lunch and likes a different kind of book. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1: The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Clue 2: The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

Clue 3: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house (Clue 2), the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in the same house.

Clue 1 tells us the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the last person. We know the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the first house (because the person who ate spaghetti lives there), and the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. That means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 3. The correct answer is (C) 3."
"I think I can help you solve this puzzle.

We know that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner. Let's look at the houses:

House 1: tulips
House 2: carnations

Since the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, the dog owner must live in House 2. 

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's solve the problem.

We have 2 houses. We know some things about the people living in them:

- One person likes milk, and one person only drinks water.
- One person likes yellow, and one person likes green.
- One person is eating kiwis, and one person is eating grapes.
- One person is wearing high heels, and one person is wearing sandals.

We have some clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. Now, let's think about clue 1. If the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person eating kiwis lives in house 2, then the person who only drinks water must live in house 1. 

Now, let's think about clue 2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1. 

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1. 

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the problem.

We have 2 houses next to each other. We know some things about the people living in them:

- One person has a TV and one person has a phone.
- One person is wearing high heels and one person is wearing sandals.
- One person likes tea and one person likes water.
- One person is eating kiwis and one person is eating grapes.

We have some clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The person who likes tea lives to the left of the person with a TV.

Let's think about this:

- If the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, that means the person wearing high heels can't be in the second house because the person wearing sandals is next to them.
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other, so they must be in the second and third houses.
- The person who likes tea lives to the left of the person with a TV, so the person with a TV can't be in the first house.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Person who likes tea
- House 2: Person eating grapes and wearing sandals
- House 3: Person wearing high heels
- House 4: Person with a TV

The person eating kiwis must be in the last house, which is house 4.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person likes a different drink and plays a different instrument. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in each house.

Clue 1: The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist.

Clue 2: There is one house between the violinist and the guitarist.

Clue 3: The tea drinker lives in the first house.

Clue 4: The violinist does not live in the third house.

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. The violinist can't live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or second house. But if the violinist lives in the first house, the guitarist can't live in the third house because there's no house between them. So, the violinist must live in the second house.

Now, we know the violinist lives in the second house. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. If the violinist lives in the second house, the cellist must live in the first house. The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist, so the water drinker must live in the third house.

The only person left is the guitarist. They can't live in the first house because the cellist lives there, and they can't live in the third house because the water drinker lives there. So, the guitarist must live in the second house.

The answer is option A: 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. We also know that the person who only drinks water lives directly to the left of the person wearing sandals. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

We also know that the person who likes milk lives in the third house. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

The person wearing running shoes can't live in the first house. So, they can live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

We know there's one house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers. This means the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers can't live in the same house. The person wearing loafers must live in the fifth house.

The tea drinker lives in the fifth house, and the person wearing loafers lives in the fifth house. So, the tea drinker and the person wearing loafers must be in the fifth house.

The coffee drinker can't live in the fifth house, so they must live in the third house. But we already know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. This means the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

Now we have the following order:
- The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
- The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
- The person wearing loafers lives in the fifth house.

The person with a computer can't live in the 4th house (clue 8), and the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other (clue 1). So, the person with a computer must live in the 3rd house.

The person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other (clue 1). Since the person with a computer lives in the 3rd house, the person with a gameboy must live in the 2nd house.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the person with a phone can't live in the third house because the person eating mangos lives there. So, the person with a phone lives in either the first or second house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating grapes lives directly to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person drinking water must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating kiwis lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person eating kiwis does not live in the first house. This means the person eating kiwis lives in the second house.

5. The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player.
6. The person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils.
7. The cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person with roses. They can't live in the first house because the person with daffodils must live to the right of them (clue 6). They can't live in the third house because the cricketer doesn't live there (clue 7). So, they must live in the second house.

Now, let's place the person with daffodils. They can't live in the first house because the person with roses lives in the second house (clue 6). They can't live in the third house because the cricketer doesn't live there (clue 7). So, they must live in the first house.

The person with carnations must live in the third house because they live next to the person with horses (clue 4).

The person with horses must live in the second house because the person with daffodils lives in the first house (clue 6).

The golfer and the baseball player must live next to each other. Since the person with roses lives in the second house, the golfer and the baseball player must live in the first and third houses, but that's not possible because the person with carnations lives in the third house. So, the golfer must live in the first house and the baseball player must live in the third house.

Now, let's summarize:

- House 1: Golfer (baseball player)
- House 2: Person with roses
- House 3: Person with daffodils and carnations

The person with horses lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the person eating mangos lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house, and the dog owner must live in the second house.

So, the order of the people is:
- House 1: Bird keeper (eating oranges)

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 2 houses. We know some things about the people who live there:

- One person likes tea, one person likes root beer.
- One person plays the cello, one person plays the guitar.
- One person has horses, one person has a cat.
- One person likes mystery books, one person likes history books.

We have some clues:

1. The person who plays the cello lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who has a cat.
3. The person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other. They can't be in the same house, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order.

Now, let's think about the person who plays the cello. If they live in house 1, the person who likes mystery books would live in house 2, but that's not possible because the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live in house 2. So, the person who plays the cello must live in house 1.

Since the person who plays the cello lives in house 1, the person who likes mystery books must live in house 2.

Now, let's think about the person who likes history books and the person who has a cat. From clue 2, the person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who has a cat. Since the person who likes mystery books lives in house 2, the person who likes history books must live in house 1, and the person who has a cat must live in house 2.

But wait, we already know the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live in house 2. So, the person who has a cat must live in house 1.

Now, we know the following:
- House 1: person who plays the cello, person who likes history books, person who has a cat
- House 2: person who likes mystery books, person who likes root beer, person who plays the guitar

The person who likes tea lives in house 1, but we don't know who it is yet. However, we can see that the person who has a cat lives in house 1, and the person who likes history books lives in house 1. So, the person who likes tea must be the person who plays the cello.

The person who plays the guitar lives in house 2, and the person who likes root beer lives in house 2. The person who likes mystery books lives in house 2, and the person who has a cat lives in house 1.

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 1. The answer is:

(A) 1"
"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person has a pet and a flower in their house. We need to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

Clue 1: The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.

Clue 2: The dog owner doesn't live in the second house.

Clue 3: The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

We know the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations. The dog owner can't live in the second house. So, the dog owner must live in either the first or the third house.

If the dog owner lives in the first house, the person with tulips can't live there because the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. So, the dog owner must live in the third house.

Now, the person with tulips must live in the second house because it's to the right of the dog owner.

So, the person with tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle!

We have 4 houses with 4 people in each house. Each person has different things like a device, shoes, a sport, a fruit, and flowers. We have 12 clues to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. This means the person with a vase of tulips can't be in the first house because the person wearing high heels is in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples doesn't live in the third house. This means the person eating apples can be in the first or fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis. This means the person wearing boots can't be in the third house because the person eating kiwis is in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers can be in the first or third house.

From clue 12, we know the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the basketball player. This means the basketball player can't be in the first house because the person with a gameboy is in the first house.

Now, let's try to figure it out!

We know the person wearing high heels is in the first house. The person eating oranges is in the first house, and the person with a vase of tulips is in the third house. The person wearing boots can't be in the third house, so they must be in the second house. The person wearing loafers can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.

The person eating a banana can't be in the first house, so they must be in the third house. The person eating kiwis is in the third house, and the person eating apples can't be in the third house, so they must be in the fourth house.

The person with a bouquet of lilies can't be in the third house, so they must be in the second house. The person with a rose bouquet is in the second house, and the person with a gameboy is in the first house.

So, the order is:
- High heels: 1
- Gameboy: 1
- Loafers: 2
- Bouquet of lilies: 2
- Rose: 2
- Bouquet of daffodils: 3
- Banana: 3
- Kiwis: 3

Let's start by putting the person eating mangos in the first house:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: ?
House 3: ?
House 4: ?

From Clue 2, we know the person owning horses can't live in the first house. So, they can live in the third or fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the person owning horses can't live in the second house. So, they must live in the third or fourth house.

From Clue 3, we know the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating mangos is in the first house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must live in the second or third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating a banana can't live in the third house. So, they must live in the first or fourth house.

From Clue 6, we know the person eating a banana lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the person eating mangos is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the dog owner must be in the fourth house.

Now we have:

House 2: Banana
House 3: ?
House 4: Dog owner

From Clue 5, we know the person owning horses can't live in the second house. So, they must live in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating a banana is in the second house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must live in the third house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From Clue 2, we know the apple eater lives to the left of the water drinker. So, the order is either 1, 2 or 2, 3.

From Clue 3, we know the mango eater doesn't live in the first house. So, the mango eater can live in the second, third, or fourth house.

From Clue 4, we know the mango eater doesn't live in the third house. So, the mango eater can live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the apple eater lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the apple eater lives to the left of the water drinker, the order is 1, 2.

From Clue 6, we know the kiwi eater doesn't live in the third house. So, the kiwi eater can live in the first, second, or fourth house.

Now, let's think about it again...

If the mango eater lives in the second house, the kiwi eater can't live in the first house because the apple eater lives in the first house. So, the kiwi eater must live in the fourth house.

If the mango eater lives in the fourth house, the kiwi eater can live in the first house.

But we know the apple eater lives to the left of the tea drinker. So, the order is 1, 2, 3, 4.

The only way this works is if the apple eater lives in the first house, the kiwi eater lives in the second house, the mango eater lives in the third house, and the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

"Let's solve the puzzle.

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has a car, a favorite color, a favorite food, and a favorite sport. We need to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 10, we know the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. Since the cellist and the flutist live in the third and fourth houses, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person who likes red lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

The person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house.

There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house.

The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house, the person who has a phone must live in the first house.

So, the correct order of the houses is:
- House 1: person who likes white, eating apples, wearing sandals, has a phone
- House 2: person who likes red, wearing running shoes
- House 3: person who is eating grapes, wearing boots, has a gameboy

The person who has a phone lives in the first house, which is option (A) 1."

"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person has different shoes and flowers. We need to figure out where each person lives.

Clue 4: The person with daffodils lives in the first house.

We know the person with daffodils lives in the first house (Clue 4) and the person with boots lives in the first house (Clue 3). So, the person with daffodils and boots is in the same house!

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The person with lilies can't live in the second house. That means the person with lilies must live in either the first or third house. But we already know the person with daffodils (and boots) lives in the first house. So, the person with lilies must live in the third house.

The person with high heels can't live in the second house (Clue 2). That means the person with high heels must live in either the first or third house. But we already know the person with daffodils (and boots) and the person with lilies live in the first and third houses, respectively. So, the person with high heels must live in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person with boots (daffodils) and high heels
- House 2: Person with lilies
- House 3: Person with rose bouquet

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 1. The correct answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza. But we don't know who had pizza yet.

We do know that the tea drinker lives in the first house. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. So, the tea drinker is in the first house, and the person with a rose bouquet is in the second house.

The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, but we already know that the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house. This means the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the third house.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. There are two houses between them, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house, but we already know that the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the person who only drinks water.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fourth house.

The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow must be to the right of the person who likes red, and the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who likes green, the person who likes yellow must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the fourth house.

The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who likes white must be to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person who likes white must be in the third house.

The root beer lover does not live in the third house. Since the person who likes white lives in the third house, the root beer lover must be in the first or second house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, and the person who had stew lives in the third or fourth house. We already know that the person who likes white lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, so the person who had stew must be in the third house.

The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker must be in the first or second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the third house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes red lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

Since the person who likes red lives in the fourth house, the person who likes green must be in the third house. But we already know that the person who likes white lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must be in the second house.

So, the correct answer is (D) 2."

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 2 houses. We know some things about the people living in them:

- One person likes red, one person likes yellow.
- One person is eating oranges, one person is eating grapes.
- One person likes mystery books, one person likes fantasy books.
- One person drives a truck, one person drives a convertible.
- One person is wearing boots, one person is wearing running shoes.

We have some clues:

1. The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. The person wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's think about the clues:

- If the person eating grapes lives left of the truck driver, that means the truck driver lives in house 2.
- The person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader lives in house 1.
- The person who likes yellow lives left of the truck driver, so the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

Now, let's think about the people in house 1:
- We know the person in house 1 is eating grapes, wearing boots, and likes yellow.
- We also know the person in house 1 is the mystery book reader (because the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader).

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know there are 5 houses in a row. We need to figure out who lives in each house.

From clue 9, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

Clue 1 says the history book buff lives to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the first or second house.

Clue 2 says there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

Clue 3 says the history book buff lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the first house.

Clue 4 says the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

Clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first or second house. But the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Clue 6 says the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house.

Clue 7 says the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the fourth house.

Clue 8 says the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a truck must live in the fifth house.

Clue 10 says there is one house between the mystery book reader and the person who drives a convertible. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the fifth house.

Clue 12 says the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

Clue 13 says the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the romance book lover must live in the third house. But we already know the person who likes green lives in the third house, so the romance book lover must be the person who likes green.

Clue 14 says the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third or fourth house. But the person who likes green lives in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following order:

1. White (likes white, drives a minivan, ate spaghetti)
2. Blue (likes blue, drives a sedan, ate fried rice)
3. Green (likes green, drives a truck, ate grilled cheese)
4. Romance book lover (likes romance, drives a convertible, ate pizza)
5. Science fiction book fanatic (likes science fiction, drives a SUV)

The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. We also know that the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who likes white must be the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who likes blue lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the basketball player must live in the third house.

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who likes green must be the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who likes red must be the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. Since the person who likes red lives in the first house, the basketball player must live in the second house.

The person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who likes blue lives directly next to the violinist. Since the violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other, the violinist must live in the third house.

The person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

"Let's solve the problem.

We have 3 houses with 3 people. Each person plays a different musical instrument and a different sport. We have some clues to help us figure out who lives in each house.

Clue 1: The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Clue 2: The basketball player lives in the second house.

Clue 3: The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2 and 3, we know the basketball player and the violinist live in the second house. So, the second house is either the basketball player or the violinist. But Clue 3 says the violinist lives in the second house, so the basketball player must live in the first house.

Now, we know the basketball player lives in the first house. Clue 1 says the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must live in the third house, and the cellist must live in the third house.

The only person left is the percussionist, and the only sport left is soccer. So, the soccer player must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. From clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly next to the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the history book buff lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house.

From clue 9, we know the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first house (because the person who likes green lives in the first house), the tea drinker must live in the third or fourth house. However, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, so the tea drinker must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must also live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. However, the history book buff lives in the second house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second or fourth house. However, the history book buff lives in the second house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

1. White - Green - History - Daffodils
2. Red - Water - Fantasy - Mystery
3. - - - - Lilies
4. - - - - Carnations

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have 4 houses with 4 people. Each person has different characteristics: they play a different musical instrument, have different pets, drink different drinks, and play different sports.

Clue 4 says the tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other. This means the tennis player must live in the third house.

Clue 5 says the guitarist doesn't live in the third house. Clue 6 says the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

Clue 7 says the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. Clue 8 says the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. This means the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in the second house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

Now, let's summarize:

- The flutist (coffee drinker) lives in the fourth house.
- The tennis player lives in the third house.
- The guitarist lives in the fifth house.
- The dog owner and the root beer lover live in the second house.

"Let's solve the puzzle!

We know that the person eating oranges lives in the first house. We also know that the person eating a banana lives in the fourth house. And the person owning an SUV lives in the fourth house too!

So, the first and fourth houses are already taken by the person eating oranges and the person eating a banana, and the person owning an SUV. 

Now, let's look at the clues again. Clue 3 says the person eating apples lives directly left of the person eating a banana. That means the person eating apples lives in the third house.

Clue 1 says the person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. Clue 7 says the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person driving a minivan. So, the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house, and the person driving a minivan lives in the fifth house.

Clue 6 says there's one house between the person with a carnations arrangement and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Clue 5 says the person owning a sedan lives to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Person with a carnations arrangement
- House 3: Person eating apples, Person owning a sedan
- House 4: Person eating a banana, Person owning an SUV

- The soccer player lives in the second house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the first house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at the first house. We know the person who likes grilled cheese lives there, and the person who likes milk lives there too. But we also know the person who likes blue lives next to the person who likes root beer. Since the person who likes root beer lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

So, the first house has the person who likes grilled cheese, the person who likes milk, and the person who likes blue. The person who likes root beer lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

From clue 12, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house. So, the person who has a rose bouquet must be the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Now we have the following order: 
1. Yellow
2. Red (Daffodils)
3. Green (Lilies)
4. White (Tulips)
5. Red (Carnations)

The person who likes green lives in the third house, so the swimmer lives in the third house.

We know that the violinist lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

Now, let's think about the other people. We have a cat lover, a bird keeper, a person with a gameboy, and a guitarist left.

Since the person with a computer lives in house 1, house 1 is taken by the violinist and the person with a computer.

That leaves house 2 for the cat lover, the bird keeper, the person with a gameboy, and the guitarist.

The person with a computer lives in house 1, and the violinist lives in house 1. So, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that there are three houses with three people in each house. Each person has different shoes, cars, and pets.

Clue 1 says the person wearing boots lives in the second house. That's a good start!

Clue 2 says the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house. But we already know that from Clue 1. So, this clue doesn't tell us anything new.

Clue 3 says the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. This means the dog owner lives in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.

Clue 5 says the cat lover lives in the first house. This means the person who owns an SUV (from Clue 4) is the cat lover.

Now, let's summarize what we know so far:
- House 1: cat lover (owns an SUV)
- House 2: person wearing boots
- House 3: dog owner (owns a sedan)

The only person left is the person wearing high heels. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house. But we already know that the person wearing boots lives in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

The only person left is the person wearing running shoes. Since the person wearing high heels lives in the first house, the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem!

We have 3 houses with 3 people in each house. Each person likes something different: tea, milk, or coffee. They also wear different shoes: running shoes, boots, or high heels. They eat different fruits: apples, kiwis, or oranges. And they like different colors: green, white, or blue.

From the clues, we can start by finding out who lives in each house.

Clue 1 says the tea drinker lives in the third house. That's a good start!

Clue 2 says the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house, and the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Clue 3 says the person who likes milk and the person eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person eating apples must live in the first house.

Clue 4 says the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. That's the same as Clue 3, so we know the person eating apples lives in the first house.

Clue 5 says the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. That's okay, we can still figure it out.

Clue 6 says the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the third house. But we already know the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must be the tea drinker.

Clue 7 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. That's the same as Clue 3, so we know the person eating apples lives in the first house.

Clue 8 says the person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in either the first or second house. But we already know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

Now we have the arrangement:
- House 1: person eating oranges, person wearing running shoes, person who likes white, person eating apples
- House 2: person eating kiwis, person wearing boots, person who likes green
- House 3: person who likes blue, person wearing high heels, person who likes milk, person who is drinking tea

The person eating apples lives in the first house. The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve the problem.

We know that the mystery book reader lives in the first house. The history book buff lives directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

The person who has a television lives directly to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the person who has a television lives in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a computer. They live to the right of the person who has a phone. We know the history book buff lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house. So, the person who has a phone must live in the first house. But that's where the mystery book reader lives! So, the person who has a phone must be the science fiction book fanatic.

"Martin Luther was a man who lived a long time ago. He wrote many things, like the 95 Theses.

If he wrote one thesis a day, we need to know how many days are in half a year. There are 365 days in a year, and half a year is 182.5 days.

"We can fit a football field on Alcatraz Island. 

To figure this out, we need to know the size of the football field and the size of the island. A football field is 300 feet long and 160 feet wide. Alcatraz Island is 1.25 miles long and 0.25 miles wide. 

First, we need to convert the island's size into feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

1.25 miles = 1.25 x 5280 = 6600 feet
0.25 miles = 0.25 x 5280 = 1320 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the football field:
Area = Length x Width
= 300 feet x 160 feet
= 48,000 square feet

Next, we calculate the area of Alcatraz Island:
Area = Length x Width
= 6600 feet x 1320 feet
= 8,656,000 square feet

Since 8,656,000 is bigger than 48,000, we can fit a football field on Alcatraz Island.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."

"So, if a goblin shark had limbs, it would still be very hard for it to ride a bike. That's because goblin sharks live in the water and don't have bodies that are made for walking or standing on land. They have a special body shape that helps them swim, but it's not good for holding onto a bike.

Even if it had arms, its body would be too soft and squishy to hold onto the bike. And its skeleton is made of cartilage, which isn't strong enough to support the weight of the bike. Plus, goblin sharks are used to swimming, not walking or balancing on land.

So, the answer is:"

"Lactic acid is a natural thing that our body makes. It's like a helper that makes our muscles work. When we exercise, our muscles get tired and need more oxygen. But sometimes, we don't get enough oxygen, so our muscles make lactic acid instead. It's not bad for us. In fact, it helps our muscles feel better when we're tired.

But if we have too much lactic acid, it can make us feel icky. It can make our muscles hurt and feel sore. But that's not because the lactic acid is bad, it's just that our body is trying to get rid of it.

So, to answer your question: lactic acid is not bad for us. It's just a natural part of how our body works."

"To find out if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to know how long each show is.

Most TV shows are about 45-60 minutes long. Let's use 50 minutes as an average. 

10 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 600 minutes
600 minutes / 50 minutes per show = 12 shows

Now, let's calculate the total storage needed per day:

12 shows x 50 minutes per show = 600 minutes
600 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 10 hours

A 500GB USB device is not enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
