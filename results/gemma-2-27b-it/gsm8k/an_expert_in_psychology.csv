*  We know that g + s = 110 (total coins)
*  We also know that g = s + 30 (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

**3. Solve for 's' (number of silver coins):**

* Substitute the second equation into the first equation: (s + 30) + s = 110
* Combine like terms: 2s + 30 = 110
* Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *q* = the number of queen bees
*  *b* = the number of baby bees
*  *w* = the number of worker bees

**We know:**

* *q + b + w = 700* (The total number of bees)
* *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
* *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

**Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees (w):**

1. **Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the second equation:**  *w = 2 * (2q) = 4q*

2. **Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the first equation:** *q + 2q + 4q = 700*

3. **Combine like terms:** *7q = 700*

4. **Solve for 'q':** *q = 100*

5. **Substitute the value of 'q' back into the equation for 'b':** *b = 2 * 100 = 200*

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the Leak:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

* **The Difference:** The big pool lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). The small pool also lost 16 gallons.

* **Ratio Change:**  Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, and now has four times as much, the big pool lost a larger proportion of its water. This means the small pool must have started with less water.

* **Let's use variables:**

    * Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.
    * 4 minutes ago, the small pool had x + 16 gallons.
    * 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2(x + 16) gallons.
    * Now, the big pool has 4x gallons.

* **Set up an equation:** The big pool lost 16 gallons and now has 4 times the water of the small pool: 2(x + 16) - 16 = 4x

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 32 - 16 = 4x
    * 2x + 16 = 4x

1. **Calculate the total number of sections:** The redwood is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet long, so there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

* **Both defects:**  We need to find the overlap – candles that have both defects.  Since the problem doesn't give us information about the relationship between the two defects (are they independent?), we have to assume they are.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Oven Heating:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, and it's on for 3 hours, so the temperature increases by 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

2. **Temperature After Baking:** The initial temperature was 40 degrees, and it increased by 15 degrees, so the temperature is now 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. **Window Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  The temperature drops 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it drops 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

4. **Final Temperature:** The temperature was 55 degrees and dropped by 6 degrees, resulting in a final temperature of 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

* Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes

**2. Calculate James's swim time:**

* James's swim time = 40 minutes * 0.90 (10% faster) = 36 minutes

**3. Calculate James's bike time:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  D = B / 2  (David found half of what Bodhi found)
*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

**Now we can solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (D = B/2) into the second equation:
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the first equation (D = B/2) and the modified second equation (L = B/2 + 7) into the third equation:
   (B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Simplify and solve for B:**
   B + 7 + B = 43
   2B + 7 = 43
   2B = 36
   B = 18

4. **Now that you know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), substitute it back into the equation D = B/2 to find D:**
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9

5. **Finally, substitute the value of D (9) into the equation L = D + 7 to find L:**
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16

* Time: 30 * (Time remaining - 4)

**Emma's points:**

* Enemies: 10 * x

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let Peter's age be ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
*  Let John's age be ""J""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age is 100)
*  Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
*  P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

**Now we can solve for Peter's age (P):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** both the second equation (Pa = J + 10) and the modified third equation (P = 2J + 10) into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10 to find P:**
   P = 2(20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



**Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'X' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + X = 339  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  X = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4A - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe)

**Now we can solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ( (4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify** and solve for A:
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339
   9A - 21 = 339
   9A = 360
   A = 40

3. **Substitute** the value of A back into the equation S = 4A - 13:
   S = (4 * 40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

**5. Determine the initial charge:**

* Final charge: 28%
* Charge remaining after 8 hours: 34%
*  The difference represents the charge used by Maria's friends: 34% - 28% = 6%
*  This 6% represents the charge used by her friends, which was part of the 34% remaining after 8 hours.
* To find the initial charge, we need to figure out what percentage 34% represents of the original charge. Let 'x' be the initial charge:

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Scoops per potato:** 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Potatoes per scoop:**  That means each scoop requires 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

3. **Gomer's scoops:** Gomer ate 23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate daily earnings from sunflowers:** Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
* **Calculate daily earnings from sunflowers in bouquets:** He earns $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he earns $56 / 12 = $4.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.
* **Calculate total daily earnings per sunflower:** His total earnings per sunflower per day are $2 + $4.67 = $6.67.
* **Calculate total earnings from sunflowers over 3 days:** His total earnings from sunflowers over 3 days are $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01/sunflower.
* **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold:** He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.  Therefore, he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.
