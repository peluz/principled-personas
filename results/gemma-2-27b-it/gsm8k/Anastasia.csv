"Let's solve this problem!

Let 'w' be the number of games won and 'l' be the number of games lost.

We know:

* w + l = 22 (total games played)
* w = l + 8 (they won 8 more than they lost)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combine like terms:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2l = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 7

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won:

w = l + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

Let 'c' be the number of camels and 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

We know:

* **Equation 1 (Heads):** c + d = 180 
* **Equation 2 (Bumps):** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries).

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'c':**  c = 180 - d
2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:** 2(180 - d) + d = 304
3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':** 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56



Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.
* The second angle is twice the smallest, so it measures 2x.
* The third angle is three times the smallest, so it measures 3x.

Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The largest angle is three times the smallest:

3 * 30 = 90

"Let's solve this problem!

Let 's' be the number of sheep and 'g' be the number of geese.

Here's what we know:

* **Heads:** s + g = 20 
* **Legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)

Now we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve for 'g' in the first equation:**
   g = 20 - s

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into the second equation:**
   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 's':**
   4s + 40 - 2s = 70
   2s = 30
   s = 15


Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies.**
* **Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.**
* **Emma collects 'y' berries.**
* **Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.**

**Emma's score:**

* Enemy points: 10x
* Berry points: 5y
* Timer points: 30 * (time remaining for Emma)

**Ava's score:**

* Enemy points: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80
* Berry points: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15
* Timer points: 30 * (time remaining for Emma - 4)

**Difference in scores:**

To find the difference, we need to subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.  Since we don't know the exact time remaining for Emma, we can't calculate a numerical answer. 

**We need more information about the time remaining for Emma to determine the difference in their scores.**

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let Peter's age be ""P""
    *  Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
    *  Let John's age be ""J""

* **We know:**
    * P + Pa + J = 100 (Their combined age is 100)
    * Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
    * P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Now we can substitute:**

Since P = Pa + J, we can substitute that into the first equation:
 (Pa + J) + Pa + J = 100

* **Simplify and solve for Pa and J:**
 2Pa + 2J = 100
 Pa + J = 50

We also know Pa = J + 10, so substitute that in:
 (J + 10) + J = 50
 2J + 10 = 50
 2J = 40
 J = 20

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pa:
 Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

* **Finally, find Peter's age (P):**
 P = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'B' represent Bahati's points.
    *  Let 'A' represent Azibo's points.
    *  Let 'D' represent Dinar's points.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    * B + A + D = 45 (Their total score is 45)

* **Solve for Azibo's points (A):**

    1. Since we know B = A + 20, substitute that into the third equation: (A + 20) + A + D = 45
    2. Simplify: 2A + D + 20 = 45
    3.  Subtract 20 from both sides: 2A + D = 25
    4. Since B = D + 10, substitute that into the equation: 2A + (B - 10) = 25
    5. Simplify: 2A + B - 10 = 25
    6. Add 10 to both sides: 2A + B = 35
    7. Now we have two equations:
        * 2A + D = 25
        * 2A + B = 35
    8.  We can solve for A by subtracting the first equation from the second: (2A + B) - (2A + D) = 35 - 25
    9. Simplify: B - D = 10
    10. Since B = D + 10, substitute that in: (D + 10) - D = 10
    11. Simplify: 10 = 10 (This confirms our equations are consistent)
    12. Now, substitute B = D + 10 back into the equation 2A + B = 35: 2A + (D + 10) = 35
    13. Simplify: 2A + D = 25 
    14. We know from earlier that 2A + D = 25, so Azibo scored:

25 - D = A

Since we don't have a specific value for D, we can't get a numerical answer for Azibo's points without more information.

    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
    * Let 'Al' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  S = 4A - 13  (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    *  Al = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
    *  A + S + Al = 339 (Together they caught 339 Pokemon)

* **Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify and solve for A:**
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   9A - 21 = 339
   9A = 360
   A = 40

3. **Substitute the value of A back into the equation for S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge loss in the first 5 hours:**

   The power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours, so the total loss was 9% * 5 = 45%.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

   If it lost 45%, then 100% - 45% = 55% of the charge remained.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge loss in the next 3 hours:**

   The power bank lost 7% per hour for 3 hours, so the total loss was 7% * 3 = 21%.

* **Step 4: Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours:**

   The charge remaining after the first 5 hours was 55%, and it lost another 21%, leaving 55% - 21% = 34%.

* **Step 5: Determine the initial charge:**

   We know that 34% represents the final charge of 28%.  Let 'x' be the initial charge. We can set up a proportion: 34% / x = 28% / 100%

   Solving for x: x = (34% * 100%) / 28% = 121.43% (approximately)

Since a power bank can't be more than 100% charged, this means there's likely a rounding error in the problem.  

Assuming the final charge was slightly higher than 28%, the initial charge when Maria left for the park was approximately **121%**.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
    *  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
    *  r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters)

* **Solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the value of 'b' from the second equation into the first equation:

Here's what we know from the problem:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:** W = 5(C + 7)
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Solve the first equation for W:**

2. **Substitute this value of W into the second equation:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3
   (3/3)C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)C - (3/3)C

"Let's solve this problem!

Let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

* c + w = 20 (total number of animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (total number of legs)

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens).

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w':  w = 20 - c
2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5


Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
