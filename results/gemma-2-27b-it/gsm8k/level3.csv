"Let's solve this problem using a system of linear equations:

* Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins.
* Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.

We know the following:

*  g + s = 110  (The total number of coins is 110)
*  g = s + 30 (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

* (s + 30) + s = 110

Combine like terms:

* 2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

* 2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

* s = 40

Now that we know s = 40, we can substitute it back into the equation g = s + 30:

* g = 40 + 30
* g = 70

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'w' represent the number of games won.**
* **Let 'l' represent the number of games lost.**

We know the following:

* **w + l = 22** (The total number of wins and losses equals the total games played)
* **w = l + 8** (They won 8 more games than they lost)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w':

1. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:** (l + 8) + l = 22
2. **Combine like terms:** 2l + 8 = 22
3. **Subtract 8 from both sides:** 2l = 14

**1. Calculate Adrien's initial salary:**

* Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning Lylah's salary was 100% of her salary and Adrien's was 130%.
* If Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, this represents 130% of Lylah's salary.
* Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary increase:**

* Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his increase was $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000.

**3. Calculate Adrien's current salary:**

* Adrien's current salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

**4. Calculate Lylah's current salary:**

* Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, so her current salary is $30,769.23 * 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

**5. Calculate the total salary:**

* The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.
* Let 'p' represent the cost of a pepper.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of an orange.

**2. Set up Equations:**

*  We know w = 3p (A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs)
*  We know o = w - 5 (An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon)

**3. Calculate Costs:**

* Since a pepper costs $15, we know p = $15.
*  w = 3 * $15 = $45 (Watermelon cost)
*  o = $45 - $5 = $40 (Orange cost)

**4. Calculate Total Cost:**

* Cost of watermelons: 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
* Cost of peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
* Cost of oranges: 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Jan's current age be ""j""
* Let Mark's current age be ""m""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Jean is two years older than Mark"":  j = m + 2
*  ""Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age"": m - 2 = 5 + (j - 2)/2

**Now we can solve for our variables:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (j = m + 2) into the second equation:
   m - 2 = 5 + (m + 2 - 2)/2

2. **Simplify** and solve for ""m"":
   m - 2 = 5 + m/2
   m - m/2 = 7
   m/2 = 7
   m = 14

3. **Substitute** the value of ""m"" (14) back into the first equation to find ""j"":
   j = 14 + 2
   j = 16

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'r' be the number of rats in each cage.**

* **Rats:** Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 'r' rats per cage, so each cage uses 6r pieces of straw. With 3 cages, the total straw for rats is 3 * 6r = 18r.

* **Hamsters:** Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 hamsters, so they use 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

* **Rabbits:** They use 20 pieces of straw.

* **Total:** The total straw used is 18r + 50 + 20 = 18r + 70.

* **We know:** The total straw used is 160 pieces. So, 18r + 70 = 160

**Now, let's solve for 'r':**

1. Subtract 70 from both sides: 18r = 90
2. Divide both sides by 18: r = 5

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.
* Let 'y' be the amount of water in the big pool now.

**2. Set up Equations**

* We know the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago: y - 4(4) = 2(x - 4(4))
* We know the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now: y = 4x

**3. Solve the System of Equations**

* Substitute the second equation (y = 4x) into the first equation: 4x - 16 = 2(x - 16)
* Simplify and solve for x: 4x - 16 = 2x - 32
                                       2x = -16
                                         x = -8

**4. Interpret the Result**

Since we're dealing with a real-world problem, we can't have negative water. This means there's likely an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the big pool to have had twice the water 4 minutes ago and then four times the water now if both are losing water at the same rate.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of linear equations:

* Let 'c' represent the number of camels.
* Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

We can set up the following equations:

* **Equation 1 (Heads):** c + d = 180 
* **Equation 2 (Bumps):** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries).

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'c':**  c = 180 - d
2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:** 2(180 - d) + d = 304
3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':** 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56


Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Here's how to solve this problem using linear programming concepts:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'y' be the number of 2x8 pieces of wood.

**2. Objective Function:**

* We want to maximize the number of popsicle sticks: Maximize Z = 200x + 400y

**3. Constraints:**

* **Cost Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (He has $24 to spend)
* **Non-negativity Constraints:** x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (He can't buy negative wood)

**4. Solve Graphically:**

* Plot the cost constraint on a graph. To do this, find the intercepts:
    * When x = 0, y = 4 (24/6)
    * When y = 0, x = 6 (24/4)
* Shade the area below the line (since it's a ""less than or equal to"" constraint).
* Since x and y must be non-negative, focus on the first quadrant of the graph.

**5. Identify Corner Points:**

* The feasible region (the shaded area) will have corner points. Find the coordinates of these points.

**6. Evaluate the Objective Function:**

* Plug the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function (Z = 200x + 400y) to see which point gives the highest value.

**7. The Answer:**

The corner point that yields the highest value for Z will represent the optimal solution, telling you the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
* 'j' represent the number of chairs Jenna has.

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

* Ophelia: sofas = c - 2 
* Jenna: sofas = j - 2
* Jenna: j = 3c

**Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we know:**

* c - 2 = 20
* c = 22 (Ophelia has 22 chairs)

**Now we can find how many chairs Jenna has:**

* j = 3 * 22 = 66 (Jenna has 66 chairs)

**Calculate Jenna's sofas:**

* j - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 (Jenna has 64 sofas)

**Finally, find the total number of sofas and chairs:**

* Total sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
* Total chairs: 22 + 66 = 88
* Total sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let Jame's current age be ""j""**
* **Let his cousin's current age be ""c""**

Here's how we can set up the equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** Jame will be 27 in 5 years:  j + 5 = 27
* **Equation 2:** In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age: c + 8 = 2(j + 8) - 5

Now we can solve for j and c:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for j:**
   j + 5 = 27
   j = 22

2. **Substitute the value of j into Equation 2:**
   c + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**

* **Red jelly beans:** There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.

* **Green jelly beans:** There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:** The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

**Now we can solve for 'b':**

* Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.99: b ≈ 1501.67

Since we can't have fractions of jelly beans, we'll round 'b' to the nearest whole number: b ≈ 1502

**Calculate the difference between green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1502 ≈ 1517
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1502 ≈ 1487
* Difference: 1517 - 1487 = 30

"Let's solve this problem using a system of linear equations:

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

Here's our system of equations:

* **Equation 1 (Legs):** 4s + 2g = 70  (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2 (Heads):** s + g = 20

Now we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':** 
   g = 20 - s

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:**
   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 's':**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'w' be the number of white fish Bob bought.**
* **Let 'o' be the number of orange fish Bob bought.**

Here's what we know:

* **Initial:** Bob started with 3 orange and 4 white fish.
* **Purchase:** He bought 'w' white and 'o' orange fish.
* **Total:** He bought a total of 17 fish (w + o = 17).
* **Final:** He ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish (3 + o = 2(4 + w)).

Now we have two equations:

1.  w + o = 17
2.  3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w' (the number of white fish Bob bought):

1. **Simplify the second equation:** 3 + o = 8 + 2w
2. **Rearrange the second equation to solve for 'o':** o = 5 + 2w
3. **Substitute this value of 'o' into the first equation:** w + (5 + 2w) = 17
4. **Combine like terms:** 3w + 5 = 17
5. **Subtract 5 from both sides:** 3w = 12
6. **Divide both sides by 3:** w = 4

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* **z:** ounces of zest
* **f:** ounces of fragrance
* **s:** ounces of salt
* **o:** ounces of oil
* **su:** ounces of sugar

Here's what we know from the problem:

* **z = f** (same amount of zest as fragrance)
* **s = su** (same amount of salt as sugar)
* **o = 2s** (twice as much oil as salt)
* **s = 2z** (twice as much salt as zest)
* **z + f + s + o + su = 10** (total ounces in the jar)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the amount of oil (o):

1. **Since z = f and s = su, we can rewrite the total ounces equation:**
   z + z + s + o + s = 10

2. **Combine like terms:**
   2z + 2s + o = 10

3. **Substitute s = 2z:**
   2z + 2(2z) + o = 10

4. **Simplify:**
   2z + 4z + o = 10
   6z + o = 10

5. **Substitute o = 2s and s = 2z:**
   6z + 2(2z) = 10

6. **Simplify and solve for z:**
   6z + 4z = 10
   10z = 10
   z = 1

7. **Now that you know z = 1, you can find o:**
   o = 2s = 2(2z) = 2(2 * 1) = 4

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'B' represent the number of cards Becca has.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
    *  Let 'P' represent the number of cards PJ has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B + S + P = 341  (The total number of cards)
    * B = S + 12      (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)
    * S = 3P           (Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has)

* **Solve for the variables:**

   1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
      (S + 12) + S + 3P = 341

   2. **Simplify** and solve for S:
      2S + 3P + 12 = 341
      2S + 3P = 329

   3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 3P) into the simplified equation:
      2(3P) + 3P = 329

   4. **Solve** for P:
      6P + 3P = 329
      9P = 329
      P = 36.56 (Since we can't have fractions of cards, there must be an error in the problem setup) 

It seems there's an inconsistency in the problem. It's impossible to have a fraction of a card. Please double-check the numbers provided in the problem.

* **Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd' and Adam's current age by 'a'.**

* **Eight years ago, Duncan was d - 8 years old.**
* **Four years ago, Adam was a - 4 years old.**

* **The problem states:** d - 8 = 2(a - 4) 

* **We also know that Duncan is currently 60 years old, so d = 60.**

Now we can solve for Adam's current age ('a'):

2. **Simplify:** 52 = 2a - 8
3. **Add 8 to both sides:** 60 = 2a

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims before resting.**

* 60% of 20 miles = (60/100) * 20 miles = 12 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the time James spends swimming the first part.**

* Time = Distance / Rate = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.**

* Rest time = Swimming time / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 'B' represent the number of points Bahati scored.
* Let 'A' represent the number of points Azibo scored.
* Let 'D' represent the number of points Dinar scored.

We know the following:

* B + A + D = 45 (The total points scored)
* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)

Now we can use substitution to solve for A (Azibo's points):

1. **Substitute 'A + 20' for 'B' in the first and third equations:**
   * (A + 20) + A + D = 45
   * (A + 20) = D + 10

2. **Simplify the first equation:**
   * 2A + D = 25

3. **Solve the second equation for 'D':**
   * D = A + 10

4. **Substitute 'A + 10' for 'D' in the simplified first equation:**
   * 2A + (A + 10) = 25

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the age difference:** Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it when he was three times that age, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.
* **Find the age difference between sightings:** Since Comet Halley orbits every 75 years, the difference in age between Bill's dad and Bill when they saw the comet is 90 - 30 = 60 years.
* **Find the number of comet cycles:** This 60-year difference represents 60 / 75 = 0.8 comet cycles.

* **Find Bill's age at his first sighting:** Since Bill saw the comet 0.8 cycles after his dad, he was 30 years old * 0.8 = 24 years old when he first saw it.

**1. Find the total number of flights for the first plane:**

* The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
* The first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips per day.

**2. Find the number of flights the first plane takes to destinations other than Greece:**

* The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights.
* This means the first plane takes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany combined.

**3. Find the number of flights to France:**

* The flights to France and Germany are split equally, so the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

* Let 'Al' represent Alessandro's age (Al = 4)
* Let 'H' represent Helene's age
* Let 'W' represent Wilfred's age

**2. Formulate equations:**

*  We know the total age is 20: A + Al + H + W = 20
*  We know Helene's age is twice the average age: H = 2 * ((A + Al + H + W) / 4)

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, Madeline also painted 'A' eggs.**
* **Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.**

We know the following:

* **A + A + C + S = 56** (Total eggs painted)
* **C + S = 30** (Camden and Sarah's total)
* **C = S + 12** (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the variables:

2. **Simplify and solve for 'S':** 2S + 12 = 30 => 2S = 18 => S = 9

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**

* One person needs 100% energy, so 2300 people need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of daily energy.

**2. Calculate the energy provided by the current production:**

* Hortex produces enough juice to cover 20% per bottle * 4200 bottles = 84000% of daily energy.

**3. Calculate the energy deficit:**

* The deficit is 230000% - 84000% = 146000%.

**4. Calculate the additional bottles needed:**

* Each bottle covers 20%, so to cover 146000%, Hortex needs 146000% / 20% = 7300 bottles.

* 3/4 of the babies wear purple, and 1/3 of those wear bows: (3/4) * (1/3) = 1/4 of the babies wear purple and a bow.

**2. Blue Wearers with Bows:**

* 1/4 of the babies wear blue, and all of them wear bows: (1/4) * (1) = 1/4 of the babies wear blue and a bow.

**3. Total Bow Wearers:**

*  1/4 (purple with bows) + 1/4 (blue with bows) = 1/2 of the babies wear bows.

**4. Conditional Probability:**

* We want the probability of a baby wearing purple *given* that they are wearing a bow. This is a conditional probability.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.
*  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  r = 4b  (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)
*  b = y - 7 (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
*  r + b + y = 37 (The 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters)

**Now we can solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation into the first equation to eliminate 'b':
   r = 4(y - 7)
   r = 4y - 28

2. **Substitute** both the first and second equations into the third equation:
   (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

3. **Simplify and solve for 'y':**
   6y - 35 = 37
   6y = 72
   y = 12

4. **Substitute the value of 'y' back into the equation r = 4y - 28:**
   r = 4(12) - 28
   r = 48 - 28
   r = 20

We can set up the following system of equations:

*  p = 14 + 2 = 16 (Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested)
*  t + b + p = 29 (The total number of items on the bench)

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' represent Vanessa's speed (miles per minute).
* Aaron's speed is then '2x' (since he's twice as fast).

**2. Set up Equations:**

* **Vanessa's time:** Time = Distance / Speed. So, Vanessa's time is 4 miles / x miles per minute = 4/x minutes.
* **Aaron's time:** We know Aaron's time is 16 minutes. Let 'y' represent the distance Aaron ran.  His time is also y miles / 2x miles per minute = 16 minutes.

**3. Use the Information about Distance:**

* Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron: 4 miles = 2y

**4. Solve for Aaron's Distance:**

* From the equation above, we find that y = 2 miles.

**5. Solve for Vanessa's Speed:**

* Using Aaron's time equation: 2 miles / 2x = 16 minutes
* Simplify: 1/x = 8 minutes
* Therefore, x = 1/8 miles per minute (Vanessa's speed)
