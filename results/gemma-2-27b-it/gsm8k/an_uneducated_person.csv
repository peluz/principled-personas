"Okay, so Janet gets 16 eggs. She eats 3 and uses 4, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs gone.

That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18.


18 

"
"Okay, so it takes 2 bolts of blue and half of that is 1 bolt of white.

That's 2 + 1 = 3 bolts

"
"Okay, so Josh spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 on the house.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, so that's like adding 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000 to the original price.

That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

So, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


$70,000 

"
"Okay, so he runs 3 sprints times 60 meters each, that's 180 meters each time he runs.

Then he does that 3 times a week, so 180 times 3 is... 540 meters.


540 

"
"Let's think about this.

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups already.

Each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 cups total.

To find out how much she needs for the last meal, we subtract the first two meals from the total: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.


20 

"
"Okay, so Kylar gets a deal on every other glass.  That means half the glasses are full price and half are cheaper.

Let's see... 16 glasses divided by 2 is 8 glasses.

So 8 glasses cost $5 each, that's 8 times 5 which is $40.

The other 8 glasses cost 60% of $5, which is... hmm... 60 out of 100 is like 3 fifths, so that's $3.

So those 8 glasses cost 8 times $3, which is $24.

Now we add the two prices together: $40 plus $24 is $64.


64 

"
"Okay, so Charleston has 4 times Seattle's sheep, which is 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

All together they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

260 

"
"Here's how I'd figure that out:

* **First, figure out how much data was downloaded before the restart:** 200 GB * 40% = 80 GB
* **Then figure out how long it took to download that much:** 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes
* **Add the restart time:** 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes
* **Figure out how much data is left to download:** 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB
* **Calculate the time to download the rest:** 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes
* **Add up all the time:** 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

"
"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Then he's stuck for 2 hours, so he doesn't go anywhere.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, so that's 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

He has 1.5 hours left (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) to drive at 80 mph, so that's 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

So, in total, he's driven 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles away from home.

But then he turns around and drives back some of that distance.

He drives for 2 hours at 30 mph, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 miles back towards home.

Then he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph, so that's 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles back towards home.

In total, he drives back 60 + 120 = 180 miles.

So, he's 315 - 180 = 135 miles from home.

135 

"
"Okay, so Eliza gets $10 for every hour she works up to 40 hours. That's 40 times $10, which is $400.

She worked 5 extra hours, so that's overtime. Overtime is 1.2 times her regular pay, so that's $10 times 1.2, which is $12.

She gets $12 for each of those 5 overtime hours, so that's $12 times 5, which is $60.

Now we add her regular pay and her overtime pay: $400 plus $60 is $460.


460 

"
"Okay, so it had 60 downloads the first month.

Then it got three times that much the second month, so that's 60 times 3 which is 180 downloads.

The third month it went down by 30%, so we gotta figure out 30% of 180... that's like 180 divided by 10, which is 18, then times 3, so 54 less downloads.

So the third month had 180 minus 54, which is 126 downloads.

Now we add all three months together: 60 plus 180 plus 126.

That's 366 downloads total.

366 

"
"Okay, so Toula bought a lotta sweets!

* Donuts cost 3 times $68, so that's 3 * $68 = $204
* Cupcakes cost 2 times $80, so that's 2 * $80 = $160
* Cheesecakes cost 6 times $55, so that's 6 * $55 = $330

Now we add all that up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694


$694 

"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $90 at first. Then he makes $1.50 for each lemon, but it costs $3 to take care of the tree.

Let's see... he makes 7 lemons a year times $1.50 each, that's $10.50.

But he spends $3, so he only makes $7.50 each year.

Hmm, so how many times does $7.50 go into $90?

...

12



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

She has 5 left, so before the orange house she had 5 times 2, which is 10.

Before the red house she had 10 plus 2, so that's 12.

And before the green house, she had 12 times 3, which is 36.


36 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the students like that fancy dancin', that's 20 times 0.20 which is 4 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then 25% of them like jazz, so that's 16 times 0.25 which is 4 students.

So, 16 - 4 = 12 students like hip-hop.

That's 12 out of 20 students, so 12 divided by 20 times 100 is... 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so the jewelry goes up by 2.5% of $5,000... that's like 2.5 cents for every dollar, so 2.5 times 5,000 is 125 bucks.

The gadgets go up by 1.2% of $8,000... so that's 1.2 cents for every dollar, so 1.2 times 8,000 is 96 bucks.

The jewelry makes more money.

125 



"
"They went 80 miles one day and 150 miles the next.

230 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So she makes 20 bucks an hour teachin' and 30 bucks an hour coachin'.

She teaches 35 hours a week, so that's 20 times 35, which is 700 bucks a week teachin'.

And she coaches 15 hours a week, so that's 30 times 15, which is 450 bucks a week coachin'.

So every week she makes 700 plus 450, which is 1150 bucks.

Now she works 50 weeks a year, so that's 1150 times 50, which is...

57500 



"
"Okay, so she eats 3 eggs a day.

That's 3 times 7 days, which is 21 eggs a week.

Then 21 times 4 weeks is 84 eggs.

A dozen is 12 eggs, so 84 divided by 12 is 7.

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to walk 12 miles total. She already walked 6 miles (4 + 2).

That leaves 6 miles left to walk.

She wants to average 4 miles per hour, so she needs to finish the whole 12 miles in 3 hours (12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours).

She already walked for 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left (3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour).

So she needs to walk the last 6 miles in 1 hour.

That means she needs to walk at 6 miles per hour (6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour).


6 

"
"Okay, so I got 10 liters of orange stuff, but most of it's just water, right?  Two-thirds water means... hmm... that's like, 6 and a half liters of water in the orange.

Then I got this pineapple stuff, 15 liters, and three-fifths of that is water.  That's like... 9 liters of water.

So I got 6 and a half plus 9 liters of water, that's 15 and a half liters.

But wait, I spilled some orange! One whole liter gone.

So now I got 14 and a half liters of water.

14.5 

"
"Okay, so Raymond is older than Samantha. He was born 6 years before her, so he's 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.

That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

14 

"
"Okay, so Billy sold 3 DVDs to the first group, then 2 DVDs times 2 customers is 4 more DVDs.

That's a total of 7 DVDs.

"Well, that candle be burnin' for a right good while! Let's see...

From 1:00 to 5:00 is 4 hours.

If it melts 2 centimeters every hour, then in 4 hours it'll melt...

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (cause 100% - 25% = 75%), then I gotta figure out what 100% is.

So, I can do this: $19.50 divided by 0.75...

*scribbles on a piece of paper*

That's $26.00!


$26.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Chicken is $12, and milk is $3 each, so 5 milks is $15. Apples are $1.50 each, so 4 apples is $6. That's $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid $50, and we know she spent $33 already, so the pizza musta cost $50 - $33 = $17.

Each pizza box is $8.50, so she bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.


2 

"
"Okay, so Mishka bought a bunch of stuff.

* Shorts cost $16.50 each, and she got 3 pairs, so that's 16.50 times 3 = $49.50
* Pants cost $22.50 each, and she got 3 pairs, so that's 22.50 times 3 = $67.50
* Shoes cost $42 each, and she got 3 pairs, so that's 42 times 3 = $126.00

Now we gotta add up all that stuff: 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = $243.00


$243.00 

"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats one ice cream a day, and there are 15 in a box.  That means one box lasts her 15 days.

She needs a new box every 15 days, and she's eating ice cream for 60 days, so she'll buy 60 / 15 = 4 boxes.

Each box costs $4.00, and she needs 4 boxes, so that's 4 * $4.00 = $16.00


$16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry went 20 miles, then stopped.  He stops again 15 miles before the end, which is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

So he went 45 - 20 = 25 miles between stops.

25 

"
"Okay, so one pair of heels is $33, and the other is twice that, so it's $33 x 2 = $66.

Together the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The boots cost $5 more than that, so they are $99 + $5 = $104.


104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen are like, different ages, right?  Like, Darrell's age is 7 parts and Allen's is 11 parts.  And together they're 162 years old.

Hmm, gotta figure out how old each part is...

162 divided by 18 parts (7 + 11) is 9 years old per part.

So Allen is 11 parts times 9 years per part, which is 99 years old.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Okay, so the first friend says 80.

The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is 40, so that's 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend says 25% more than 80.  That's like a quarter of 80, which is 20, so 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we gotta find the average. That's like adding them all up and dividing by how many there are.

So, 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 divided by 3 is 80.



80 

"
"Okay, so he spends half an hour on each dog every day.  And he has 10 dogs. So that's 5 hours a day.

Then there's 7 days in a week.

So 5 times 7 is...

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

If Gretchen has more gold coins than silver coins, and there's 30 extra gold ones...

That means if we take away those extra gold ones, we'd have the same number of gold and silver.

So, let's split the rest of the coins in half: 110 coins - 30 extra gold coins = 80 coins.

80 coins split in half is 40 coins.

That means Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, add back those extra gold coins: 40 silver coins + 30 extra gold coins = 70 gold coins.


70 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more than half of that. So Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23 

"
"Okay, so Mike scores more points in the second part of the game.  That's 25% of 4 points, which is like a quarter of 4. A quarter of 4 is 1. So he scores 1 more point in the second part.

That means he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second part.

In total, he scores 4 + 5 = 9 points.

9 

"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and he gets 4 for $5.00.

That means he needs to buy 2/4 = 0.5 of a deal every day.

So each day he spends 0.5 * $5.00 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, that's $2.50 * 30 = $75.00


$75.00 

"
"John sold all his lego sets.

0 

"
"Okay, so John runs a lot!

He runs 3 hours the first day, and then half of that, which is 1.5 hours, the other two days.

That's a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running a week.

He runs 60 miles in 6 hours.

So, he runs 10 miles per hour.

10 

"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs. So she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.

She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

In 2 hours of running, she covers 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

In 4 hours of walking, she covers 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.



18 

"
"Okay, so Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, which is 1 year old. That means Ben's phone is 2 years old.

Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 4 times 2 years old.

4 * 2 = 8

"
"Okay, so I gotta figure out how many chips I can eat without goin' over my calories.

First, I gotta see how many calories I got left: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Then I gotta see how many servings that is: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, I gotta see how many grams that is: 0.8 servings * 300g / 5 servings = 48 grams.



48 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of stuff that costs $10.00.  He sells them for $2.00 each.  So if he makes 20 candles, that's two pounds of stuff.  Two pounds of stuff costs $20.00.  He makes $40.00 selling 20 candles.  So he makes $20.00 profit.


20 

"
"Okay, so Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more than Monday, so that's (2/5) * 5 = 2 more articles.

That means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Each article takes 4 hours, so she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.


104 

"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80, used 220, and had 23 left.

Let's see... 80 + 23 = 103.  

That means she used 220 - 103 = 117 Post-it notes.

117 



"
"Okay, so John bought some blue ties and red ties.  The blue ties cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them.  That means he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

He bought twice as many red ties, so he got 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 0.50) = $60 each.

He spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties.

In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.


$800 

"
"Okay, so Tracy has a big wire, right? And she cuts it into little pieces.  

Let's see... there are 12 inches in a foot, so her big wire is 4 times 12, which is 48 inches long.

Now she cuts it into pieces that are 6 inches each. So we gotta see how many times 6 goes into 48.

That's 48 divided by 6... hmm...

8



"
"Okay, so there's lotsa floors and each one has some places to live.  Some of them are empty though.

Let's see... 15 floors times 8 places on each floor is... hmm... that's a lot of countin'.

*counts on fingers*

120 places in the whole buildin'.

But only some are full, right? Three out of four are full... so one out of four is empty.

*scratches head*

That means... 120 divided by 4 is 30.

So there's 30 empty places.

"Okay, so Lloyd gets 252 eggs a day. That's a lotta eggs!  He sells them for 2 dollars every 12 eggs. So, gotta figure out how many dozens he gets a day, then times that by 2 bucks. Then times that by 7 for the whole week.

"
"Okay, so Tom sails for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).

He goes 30 miles (10 miles per hour times 3 hours).

Then he has to go 30 miles back, but slower.

30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour is 5 hours.


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

He takes out 30 comic books, and each one weighs a quarter pound, so that's 30 times 1/4... which is 7.5 pounds.

He needs to take out 15 pounds total, and he already took out 7.5, so he needs to take out 7.5 more pounds.

Each toy weighs half a pound, so he needs to take out 7.5 divided by 0.5... which is 15 toys.


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes more money fixin' truck tires, those big ol' things cost $60 a pop!

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 times $60, which is $360.

He also fixed 4 car tires, so that's 4 times $40, which is $160.

So on Thursday, he made $360 plus $160, which is $520.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of 'em. That's 12 times $40, which is $480.

Thursday was a better day for him, he made $520 then and only $480 on Friday.

So he made $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday.



$40 

"
"Okay, so Patchy had three times the 7 kittens they brought home, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Then they had 21 + 12 = 33 kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

Don't forget the 7 they already had!

So, 33 + 7 = 40 kittens!

"
"Okay, so the truck and driver are already pretty heavy.  We gotta see how much weight is left for the boxes.

5000 (bridge limit) - 3755 (truck and driver) = 1245 pounds left for boxes

Now we gotta see how many boxes fit in that weight.

1245 (weight left) / 15 (weight per box) = 83 boxes


83 

"
"Okay, so he had to pay extra stuff on top of the $40.

First, the fee is 25% of $40, which is like a quarter of it. A quarter of 40 is 10.

So now it's $40 + $10 + $3 + $4

That's $57

"Hmm, let me see...

* There's one bad orange, so that's gone.
* Twenty percent unripe... that's like, a fifth, right? So maybe 5 oranges are unripe?
* Two are sour, so those are out too.

That's 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that ain't good.

So, 25 total oranges minus 8 bad ones leaves...

17 



"
"Okay, so she spent $500 plus $800, that's $1300.

Then she paid 10% more, so that's... hmm... 10% of 1300 is...  

Let's see, 10% is like 10 out of 100, so that's 130.

So she paid $1300 plus $130, which is...

$1430 

"
"Okay, so Marcy works for a long time and gets money when she stops.

After 20 years she gets extra money, like a bonus.

She leaves after 30 years, so she gets the regular money plus some bonus money.

Let me see... 30 years is 10 years after she starts getting the bonus.

So she gets 10 years of bonus money.

Each year of bonus is 5% of $50,000.

That's $2,500 extra each year.

So after 10 years, that's $2,500 x 10 = $25,000 extra.

Her regular money is $50,000.

So her total is $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

$75,000 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month.

That's like $140 times 6 months for the first half of the year, which is $840.

Then they give her a discount, so she pays 10% less, which is $140 times 0.10, that's $14 less each month.

So, for the second half of the year, she pays $140 - $14 = $126 each month.

That's $126 times 6 months, which is $756.

Now, to find the total, we add the first half and the second half: $840 + $756 = $1596.


1596

"Hmm, so Sophia went 100 miles on 4 gallons...  If her tank holds 12 gallons, that's like having 3 times as much gas!

So she could probably go 3 times as far...

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for half that time, which is 1 hour.

So that's 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours each time he does this.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours x 3 = 9 hours a week.

Over 4 weeks, that's 9 hours x 4 = 36 hours.


36 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* Each school has 2 teams, and each team has 5 players, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 players per school.
* They also have 2 coaches per school.
* So each school sends 10 + 2 = 12 people.
* With 4 schools, that's 12 * 4 = 48 people total.


48 

"
"Okay, so there's diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

Diamonds: 175

Rubies: 175 - 35 = 140

Emeralds: 140 x 2 = 280

Now we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595


595 

"
"Okay, so there's twice as many boys as girls, which means there's 60 girls times 2, that's 120 boys.  

That's a total of 120 plus 60, so 180 kids.

Now, there's 5 kids for every teacher, so we gotta divide the total kids by 5.

180 divided by 5 is 36.

"Bailey got $5 a week for 8 weeks, so that's $5 * 8 = $40.

If she has $100 now, and $40 came from her allowance, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.

$60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lotta classes!

Let's see... 5 classes a day times 5 weekdays is 25 classes.

Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday, so that's 25 + 8 = 33 classes total.

Each class has 15 kids, so that's 33 times 15, which is 495 kids.

And she makes $15 from each kid, so she makes 495 times $15...

Hmm, that's a lot of multiplyin'.  

495 * 15 = 7425


7425 

"
"The second recipe has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

In total, Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.

60
"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for 3 dollars each and he sells 43 of them. That's 3 times 43... which is... um... 129 dollars.

Then he sells cheesecake for 4 dollars a slice and he sells 23 of them. So that's 4 times 23... which is... 92 dollars.

Now we gotta add those together. 129 plus 92...  

221



"
"Okay, so Shiela buys five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 times 150... which is 750.  

Then there's interest, 2% of each phone... so that's 150 times 0.02... which is 3.  

But she buys five phones, so the interest is 3 times 5... that's 15.

So the phones cost 750 plus the 15 interest, making it 765 total.

Now she pays over 3 months, so 765 divided by 3 is... 255.



255 

"
"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for $3 a pot now, petunias for $2 a pot, and begonias for $2 a pot.

He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 times $3, which is $36.

He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 times $2, which is $18.

He sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 times $2, which is $34.

Now we add all that up: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88


88 

"
"Okay, so the top is 16, and each one below is double that... so the one under it is 32, then 64, then 128.

If we add them all up, it's 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240

Then we divide by 4 because there are 4 levels.

240 / 4 = 60


60 

"
"Okay, so the puppy eats 1 cup a day for a while, then 2 cups a day after.  That's a lot of cups!

Let's see... 180 days times 1 cup is 180 cups.

Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year.  There are 365 days in a year, so that's 365 minus 180, which is 185 days.

185 days times 2 cups is 370 cups.

So in total, that's 180 plus 370, which is 550 cups.

Now we gotta see how many bags that is.  Each bag has 110 cups, so 550 divided by 110 is... 5 bags.



5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah does a whole lotta laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond's a bit lazier, he only does half of what Sarah does. That's 400 divided by 2, which is 200 pounds.

Now, David's the real slacker. Sarah does 4 times more than him, so he only does 400 divided by 4, which is 100 pounds.

To find the difference between Raymond and David, we take Raymond's laundry and subtract David's: 200 minus 100.

100 



"
"Okay, so Vincent needs 18 flowers.

If he buys the packs of 3, that's 18 / 3 = 6 packs.

That'd cost him 6 * $2.50 = $15.00

If he buys the packs of 2, that's 18 / 2 = 9 packs.

That'd cost him 9 * $1.00 = $9.00

He saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

$6.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 30% off of a hundred bucks... that's like, thirty dollars off, right?

So it costs 70 dollars.

70 

"
"Okay, so two girls got some water, then a boy got some.  Let's see...

Each girl got 24 divided by 6, which is 4 liters.

So both girls got 4 plus 4, which is 8 liters.

That leaves 24 minus 8, which is 16 liters.

Then the boy got 6 liters, so we take 16 minus 6...

"
"Charlie starts with 10 stickers.

He gets more stickers: 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

He gives some away: 54 - 9 = 45 stickers

He uses some stickers: 45 - 28 = 17 stickers


17 

"
"Okay, so Alex weighs less than Grace, but four times more than her.  That's tricky!

Let's see... four times Grace's weight is 125 times 4, which is 500.

Alex weighs 2 less than that, so he weighs 500 - 2, which is 498.

Now we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623


623 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 3 bushes times 25 roses... that's lotta roses!  And each one has 8 pokey things...

600



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they won more than they lost, so gotta add some to the lost ones...

22 games total...  

Let's say they lost 7 games... then they won 15... that's 8 more!

15 

"
"Okay, so Gene goes on four trips every year, and he's been doin' that since he was 23. Now he's 34, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of trips.

That's 11 years times 4 trips a year, so he's been on 11 * 4 = 44 trips.

That means he has 44 quilt blocks.


44 

"
"Okay, so Greg's alarm is real loud!

First time it rang 4 times.

Second time it rang 4 times times 3, so that's 12 times.

Third time it rang 12 times divided by 2, so that's 6 times.

Now we add them all up: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22


22 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise every year, right?

Let's see... 10% of 600 is 60 bucks. So after one year, she makes 660.

Then another 10% of that is... hmm... 66. So she makes 726 the next year.

And another 10%... that's 72.60, so she makes 798.60 the year after.

798.60



"
"Let's think about this. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, that means Harald sold 1 part and Marilyn sold 10 parts. That's a total of 11 parts.

If they sold 88,000 copies in total, and that's 11 parts, then one part is 88,000 / 11 = 8,000 copies.

Harald sold 1 part, so he sold 8,000 copies.

8000 

"
"Okay, so Christina needs less bags than friends cuz some don't come.

She needs .75 bags for each friend, so that's like 3/4 of a bag.

She invited 16 friends, so she needs 3/4 times 16 bags.

That's like 12 bags.

Each bag costs $2, so 12 bags cost 12 times 2 dollars.

That's $24.


24 

"
"Okay, so grown-up dinos eat 10 pounds each.  Little dinos eat 5 pounds cause that's half of 10.  There's 20 big dinos so that's 20 times 10 which is 200 pounds.  Then there's 5 little dinos and they eat 5 pounds each so that's 5 times 5 which is 25 pounds.  Now we add those together, 200 plus 25 is 225.


225 

"
"Okay, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.

That means they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets all together.

28 

"
"Corey is 11 years old because James is 10 and Corey is 1 year older.

Amy is 9 years old because she is 2 years younger than Corey.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 4 years old.


4 

"
"Okay, so Lee is faster than Gerald. Gerald got better, so now he's faster than before.  

Let's see... Lee runs it in 38 seconds, and he was 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald used to take 40 seconds.

If Gerald got 10% faster, that means he takes off 10% of 40 seconds. 

10% of 40 is 4.

So Gerald now runs it in 36 seconds.


36 

"
"Okay, so there's 60 dogs.

And for every dog there's 2 cats, so that's 60 times 2 which is 120 cats.

That means there's 120 plus 60 which is 180 cats and dogs.

There's 12 less rabbits than that, so there's 180 minus 12 which is 168 rabbits.

So in total there's 168 plus 180 which is 348 pets.

348 

"
"Okay, so there's 200 kids in total.

Two-fifths of them are boys, so that's 200 divided by 5, which is 40. Then we multiply that by 2, so there's 80 boys.

That means there's 200 minus 80, which is 120 girls.

Two-thirds of the girls are in the scouts, so that's 120 divided by 3, which is 40. Then we multiply that by 2, so 80 girls are in the scouts.

That means 120 minus 80 equals 40 girls are not in the scouts.


40 

"
"Okay, so Harry slept a whole bunch, right? James slept less, like, not even the whole thing Harry did.  Gotta figure out how much less...

James slept 2/3 of Harry's 9 hours, so that's like... 2 times 3 is 6, right?  So James slept 6 hours.

Harry slept 9 and James slept 6... that means Harry slept 3 more hours.


3 

"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce is half the size of the cans, so she used 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Each can has 16 ounces, so she used 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.

Each can has 3 tomatoes, so she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

So, 30 cars started, and 5 took a different way out. That leaves 25 cars. Then 20 cars went through in the last part.

So, 25 minus 20 is... 5 cars musta gone through first.


5 

"
"Mary starts with 2 plants per ledge and has 40 ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 plants.

She gets 18 more plants, so she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

She gives away 1 plant from each of her 40 ledges, so she gives away 40 plants.

That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.

58 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

* The second friend rang the doorbell more than the first friend, so we gotta add some to the first friend's number.
* The third friend rang it a bunch more than the fourth friend.

Let me see...

* Second friend: 20 + (20 * 1/4) = 25 times
* Third friend: 60 + 10 = 70 times

Now, let's add up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo needs to read a whole bunch of pages!

Let's see... 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages in total.

He already read 15, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

He has 4 days to read them, so he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.


6 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

He drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so that's 3 glasses a day.

And he does that 5 days a week, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 glasses.

But on the weekend he has soda with dinner, so he only drinks 2 glasses of water on Saturday and Sunday.

That's 2 times 2, which is 4 glasses.

So in total, he drinks 15 plus 4 glasses of water.

19 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

It takes 10 minutes for every 3 miles... and the city is 42 miles... so we gotta figure out how many 3s fit in 42.

That's like, 14 times, right?

So if it takes 10 minutes for each 3 miles, and there are 14 sets of 3 miles...

10 times 14 is... 140!

"Cody eats a lot more cookies than Amir!  If Amir eats 5, Cody eats 3 times that, so he eats 15.

15 + 5 = 20

"
"Hmm, boxes...inches...

Let's see...

* Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 on the outside, but the walls take up space.
* So, the inside is gonna be a bit smaller.

*  5 inches on the outside, take away 1 inch for each wall, that's 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches inside.
* Same for the other sides, 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches and 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches.

* So, each box inside is 3 by 4 by 2.

* To find the space inside, we gotta multiply: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

* John has 3 boxes, so we multiply that by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.



72 

"
"Okay, so Frankie watched a lot of TV!

Let's see...

* Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day is 2 hours total.
* Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 hours * 1 hour each = 2 hours
* That's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV so far.

* He watched 7 hours total, so 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
* 1.5 hours is the same as 3 half-hour episodes.



3 

"
"Hmm, lots of numbers! Let's see...

He has 110 now, but dropped 5, so that's 110 + 5 = 115.

Then he made 15 extra, so that's 115 - 15 = 100.

And that's twice the amount from last year, so he made 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50 

"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.

That means they save $0.20 x 10 gallons = $2.00 total.

So the gas costs $3.00 x 10 gallons = $30.00

Then take away the $2.00 they save: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00


$28.00 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice ate 2 times 24 which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell ate 3 times 14 which is 42 roll-ups.  That's 48 plus 42 which is 90 roll-ups all together.

90 / 2 = 45

"
"Okay, so Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.  That means she rows 1 foot every 0.8 seconds (16 seconds / 20 feet = 0.8 seconds per foot).

The shore is 64 seconds away, and she rows 1 foot every 0.8 seconds, so the shore is 80 feet away (64 seconds / 0.8 seconds per foot = 80 feet).

For every 10 feet she rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. She rowed 80 feet, so that's 16 sets of 10 feet (80 feet / 10 feet per set = 8 sets).

That means the boat took on 32 liters of water (16 sets * 2 liters per set = 32 liters).


32

"Hmm, lemme see...

4 teachers times 2 lessons each is 8 lessons.

And they clean it 3 times per lesson... so that's 8 times 3...

"Okay, so Ryan plants 2 flowers each day for 15 days. That's 2 times 15, which is 30 flowers. But 5 didn't grow, so we gotta take those away.

30 - 5 = 25

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Jamal's phone holds way more pictures than Brittany's.  Brittany's phone can hold a whole bunch more pictures than Jamal's duck picture has ducks.  Jamal's phone holds 1800 pictures, and that's 6 times more than Brittany's. So Brittany's phone holds 1800 divided by 6, which is 300 pictures.

Now, Brittany's phone holds 50 times more pictures than ducks in Jamal's picture. So there are 300 pictures divided by 50, which is 6 ducks.



6 

"
"Okay, so lumber is more expensive now, that's good for Sasha!

She has ten of the smaller boards, and they cost $10 each, so that's 10 times $10, which is $100.

The bigger boards cost $16 each, and she has five, so that's 5 times $16, which is $80.

So all together, her lumber cost her $100 + $80, which is $180.

Now, since prices went up 50%, she can sell each small board for $10 plus half of $10, which is $5, so each small board is now worth $15.

The big boards are now worth $16 plus half of $16, which is $8, so each big board is now worth $24.

Ten small boards at $15 each is 10 times $15, which is $150.

Five big boards at $24 each is 5 times $24, which is $120.

So she sells all the lumber for $150 + $120, which is $270.

To find her profit, we take what she sells it for and subtract what she paid for it: $270 - $180 = $90.



$90 

"
"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water, like 7 teaspoons sugar for every 13 cups of water.  

If she used 120 teaspoons and cups total, gotta figure out how many of those are teaspoons.

Hmm... 7 + 13 is 20.  

So, for every 20 parts, 7 are sugar.

120 divided by 20 is 6.

6 times 7 is 42.


42 

"
"Okay, so John buys shoes for his kids.  He gets 2 shoes for each kid, and he has 3 kids. So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 shoes.

Each shoe costs $60, so 6 shoes cost 6 times 60.

6 times 60 is 360.


360 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Two containers with five cars each is ten cars, right?

So they had 30 cars total and started with 10, that means they got 20 more cars.

If each container has five cars, then they got 20 divided by 5... which is 4 more containers.

"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40000 four years ago. That's his starting point.

His salary was 30% more than Lylah's, so Lylah made less.

Four years later, Adrien makes 40% more than his old salary. That means he got a raise!

To find out how much more he makes now, we gotta do some math.

...

*Adrien's salary four years later:*  $40000 + (40/100)*$40000 = $56000

*Lylah's salary four years ago:* $40000 / 1.30 = $30769.23 (approximately)

*Lylah's salary increase:* (40/100) * $30769.23 = $12307.69 (approximately)

*Lylah's salary four years later:* $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43076.92 (approximately)

*Total salary four years later:* $56000 + $43076.92 = $99076.92



$99076.92 

"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So that's 2 times 30, which is 60 sheets a week.

Now, a month has about 4 weeks. So he uses 60 sheets a week times 4 weeks, which is... 240 sheets a month.

240 

"
"Okay, so Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.

Kael has 5 apples * 2 = 10 apples and 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges.

That's 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits for Kael.

Together they have 13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits.


27 

"
"Okay, so Sadie slept less on Tuesday and Wednesday.

That's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

Then the rest of the week she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours.

So for the whole week it's 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Rosie runs fast at first, then slower.  

Let's see... 10 miles an hour for 3 hours is... 10 times 3... that's 30 miles!

Then she runs slower for the rest of the time. That's 7 hours total minus the 3 hours she already ran, so 4 more hours.

She runs 5 miles an hour then, so that's 5 times 4... which is 20 miles.

So, all together, she runs 30 miles plus 20 miles... that's 50 miles!

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Julia had 12 spoons total and used 3, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 spoons.
* Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so she had 9 - 5 = 4 spoons before he gave her more.

"Amy made lotsa friends!  More than Lily. Lily made 50, and Amy made 20 more than that... so Amy made 70 friends.

Now we gotta add them up. 50 plus 70... that's 120!

"
"Okay, so...

* Watermelons cost 3 times what peppers cost, and peppers cost $15, so watermelons cost 3 * $15 = $45 each.
* Oranges cost $5 less than watermelons, so they cost $45 - $5 = $40 each.

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons at $45 each, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers at $15 each, so that's 20 * $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges at $40 each, so that's 10 * $40 = $400.

* To find the total, we add up the cost of everything: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.



$880

"Okay, so they see lots of folks every day, and they charge more than the doctors get.  That means they make some extra money, right?

Let's see...

* 500 people times 24 minutes is a lotta minutes!

* Gotta figure out how many hours that is...

* Then we can see how much the doctors get paid and how much the hospital gets.

* Take the hospital's money and take away the doctor's money, and that's the profit!

$10,000 



"
"Okay, so Nissa starts with 60 elves.

A third quit, so that's 60 / 3 = 20 elves gone.

That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then 10 more quit, so 40 - 10 = 30 elves left.


30 

"
"Okay, so Joseph spent less in June.  That means we gotta take some away from his May spending.

He spent $60 less in June, so June was $500 - $60 = $440

$940 

"
"Okay, so Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times. That's 2 + 4 = 6 rides on the roller coaster.

They both rode the luge 2 times each, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they went on 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.


60 

"
"Okay, so Walt walked a bunch on Tuesday.

Let's see... 4 miles times 6 is 24 miles.

That means he walked 24 miles on Tuesday.

He walked 4 miles on Monday plus 24 miles on Tuesday, that's 28 miles.

So, he walked 41 miles total minus 28 miles, which is 13 miles on Wednesday.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

He gets 4 washes a month, and there's 12 months in a year, so that's 4 times 12... which is 48 washes.

"Okay, so Brian had 20 games but lost 5, so he has 15 now.

Bobby has 3 times that many, so 15 times 3 is 45.

40 

"
"Okay, so there's 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in Scotland, so that's 27 divided by 3, which is 9 unicorns in Scotland.

Now, two thirds of those are girls, so that's 9 divided by 3, which is 3.  Then we times that by 2, so 3 times 2 is 6.

"Okay, lemme see...

Two subs cost 2 times $7.50, so that's $15.00.

Two bags of chips cost 2 times $1.50, so that's $3.00.

Two cookies cost 2 times $1.00, so that's $2.00.

So far, that's $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Delivery is 20% of $20.00, which is... hmm...  that's like a fifth, so $4.00.

"Okay, so Mark can do 5 questions every hour.

Yesterday's test had 75 questions and he had 8 hours, so he coulda done 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

Today's test had 100 questions and he had 6 hours, so he coulda done 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

He left 100 - 30 = 70 questions from today's test.

In total, he left 35 + 70 = 105 questions incomplete.

"Okay, so there's some blue gumballs, and way more pink ones.  

Let's see... four times the blue ones is 12 times 4, which is 48.

Then we add 22 more to that, so 48 plus 22 is... 70.

"
"Hmm, let's see... 20 cars total, 12 automatic, 4 manual... that means there's 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

So, 4 out of 20 cars are semi-automatic.  That's like, a quarter, right?

"Hmm, lemme see...

If Jordan plays games for 2 hours a day, and there are 7 days in a week, that's 2 times 7, which is 14 hours of gaming.

If he worked those 14 hours instead, at $10 an hour, he'd make 14 times 10...

"Okay, so John buys some food and some stuff that ain't food.  

Food: Milk $2 + Eggs $3 = $5

Stuff: Light bulbs $3 + Cups $3 + Roach traps $4 = $10

Tax on stuff: $10 x 10% = $1

Total cost of stuff: $10 + $1 = $11

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Total clients:** 3 + 5 = 8 clients
* **Bleach needed:** 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
* **Bleach cost:** 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
* **Cloths needed:** 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

"Okay, so John has lots of pineapples!

He gets 100 from each part of his field, and he has 10 parts. So that's 100 times 10, which is 1000 pineapples each time he picks them.

A year has 4 of those 3-month times.

So he gets 1000 pineapples 4 times, which is... hmm... 1000 plus 1000 plus 1000 plus 1000... that's 4000 pineapples!

"
"Okay, so Johnny has a box with 500 pieces.

Another box has 3 times that, so that's 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces.

The last box has 1/4 the pieces of the first box, so that's 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total, we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Bees returning after the first 6 hours:** Debra saw 30 bees leave / 2 = 15 bees return.
* **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:** Debra saw 30 bees * 2 = 60 bees leave.
* **Total bees that left:** Debra saw 30 bees + 60 bees = 90 bees leave.
* **Bees returning in the last 6 hours:**  Since all 90 bees that left eventually returned, and 15 already returned, then 90 bees - 15 bees = 75 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out...

So Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries.

Then the pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so that's 9 fries.

The raccoon took two thirds of what was left, but we don't know how many were left yet.

Hmm, gotta think...

Let's see, there were 5 fries left at the end, and the ants took 1, so there were 6 fries before that.

Before the raccoon, there were 6 fries times 3, which is 18 fries.

So, before the pigeons, there were 18 fries plus 9 fries, which is 27 fries.

And before the seagull, there were 27 fries plus 7 fries, which is 34 fries.

Finally, before Dave ate any, there were 34 fries plus 14 fries, which is 48 fries.

"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three times a day on some days and two times on others.  

Let's see... three classes times one hour each is three hours. He does that three days a week, so that's nine hours.

Then he has two classes that are two hours each, so that's four hours a day. He does that two days a week, so that's eight hours.

So, nine plus eight is seventeen hours a week.

Now we gotta multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester...

Seventeen times sixteen is... 272

"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lotta stuff!

Let's see... rolls are 4 inches, and there's 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is 4/12 = 1/3 of a foot long.

He makes 300 rolls, so that's 300 * (1/3) = 100 feet of rolls.

Croissants are 6 inches, so that's 6/12 = 1/2 a foot each.

He makes 120 croissants, so that's 120 * (1/2) = 60 feet of croissants.

Baguettes are 2 feet long, and he makes 60, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 feet of baguettes.

Now we add it all up: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

"
"Okay, so the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100 yard field, so that's 15 times 100 yards, which is 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, so that's 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, so that's 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards.

So Kelly runs a total of 100 yards + 2720 yards, which is 2820 yards.

That means Kelly ran 2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

Them mutant things got 10 legs, and there's 3 of 'em, so that's 10 times 3... which is 30 legs!

"Okay, lemme see...

Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8.

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 8 times 2, which is 16.

Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 plus 3, which is 19.

Now, to find the total age, we add up all their ages: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

"Okay, so Zaid makes 6000 bucks a month.

Rent takes a quarter of that, so that's 6000 / 4 = 1500 bucks gone.

Then his car drinks up a third, which is 6000 / 3 = 2000 bucks.

That's 1500 + 2000 = 3500 bucks already spent.

He's got 6000 - 3500 = 2500 bucks left.

He gives half of that to charity, so that's 2500 / 2 = 1250 bucks gone.

Now he's got 2500 - 1250 = 1250 bucks left.

He gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, so that's 200 + 700 = 900 bucks gone.

That leaves him with 1250 - 900 = 350 bucks.

"Okay, so the winner got most of the votes, right?  That means the loser got the rest.

If 3/4 voted for the winner, then 1/4 must have voted for the loser.

* **Slower team's third runner:** 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
* **Slower team's fourth runner:** 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds
* **Slower team's total time:** 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

* **Difference:** 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds

"Okay, so Jerry can roll a 4, 5, or 6 to get a number bigger than 3. That's three numbers.

He can roll an even number, then another even number.  There are three even numbers on the die, so that's three chances for the first roll, and then three chances for the second roll. That's 3 times 3, which is 9 chances.

But there are 6 sides total on the die, so there are 6 chances for each roll.

So, it's more likely to roll a number bigger than 3.

Let's see... 3 chances out of 6 is half. 9 chances out of 6 times 6 is... hmm... that's 9 out of 36.

That's less than half.

So, it's gotta be more than 50% more likely to roll bigger than 3.

"Okay, so Russell gave the hamsters 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

He also gave the rabbits 20 pieces of straw.

That means the rats got 160 total pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are in 3 cages, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

Tickets cost $20.25, and food cost $4.50 less, so that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 for food.

Rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.00 for rides.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66.00 = $102.00

He plants 10 and chops down 2, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 more trees each year.

Over 10 years, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

So he has 50 starting trees + 80 new trees = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of them die, so that's 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

That means he loses 39 trees, leaving him with 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

Joe's whole bag weighs 1600g + 1000g = 2600g.

"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday.

Then on Tuesday she bought 4 times 3 which is 12 cakes.

On Wednesday she bought 12 times 5 which is 60 cakes.

So in total she bought 4 + 12 + 60 cakes.

That's 76 cakes!

76 

"
"Okay, so...

Plates cost a lot, six thousand each!

Half a dozen plates is like six plates, so that's six times six thousand... which is thirty-six thousand dollars!

But the cups are cheaper, twelve hundred dollars cheaper.

So the cups cost thirty-six thousand minus twelve hundred... that's thirty-four thousand eight hundred dollars.

Now we gotta figure out how much each cup costs.

Twenty dozen cups is like twenty times twelve, which is two hundred and forty cups.

So, we take the total cost of the cups and divide it by the number of cups... thirty-four thousand eight hundred divided by two hundred and forty...

Hmm, that's a lot of numbers.

Let me see...

145 



"
"Okay, so Sara needs to figure out how much money she needs.

The jacket is $30 and the shoes are $20 each, so that's $20 + $20 = $40 for the shoes.

In total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70.

She made $5 each time she babysat, and she did that 4 times, so she made $5 x 4 = $20 babysitting.

She already had $10, so now she has $20 + $10 = $30.

She needs $70 and has $30, so she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Her parents give her $4 each time she mows, so she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 times.


10 

"
"Hmmm... chickens and eggs... that's a lot of countin'!

Let's see... white chickens lay more eggs... so maybe he has more white ones...

*scratches head*

This is hard!

...

...

I dunno... maybe 6 red chickens?


6 

"
"Okay, so the park is like a big square thingy, right?  

One side is 1.5 miles, and the other is 6 miles.  To walk all the way around, you gotta do both sides twice, so that's like 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 6 plus 6.

That's 15 miles total!

And he walks 3 miles every hour, so it takes him 15 divided by 3 hours.

5 



"
"Okay, so she saw 100 people the first day, and then 50 more the next day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 people.

That means on the third day she saw 500 - 150 = 350 people.


350 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Two pools leakin', huh?  

So, the big one was full of water, then it started leakin' and now it's got four times the water as the little one.

And the little one's been leakin' too, but it had half as much to start with.

Gosh, this is tricky...

"
"Okay, so Lori needs to make $320 + $32 = $352.00

If she makes $8.00 each hour, she needs to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours.

"
"Okay, so Janeth owes more than just the $2000 'cause she gotta pay extra.

That extra is 10% of $2000, which is like... a tenth of it.

A tenth of 2000 is 200, so she owes 2000 plus 200, that's 2200 in total.

Now, she's payin' $165 every month for a whole year, that's 12 months.

So, she's payin' 165 times 12, which is 1980.

If she pays 1980 but owes 2200, she still owes 2200 minus 1980.

That's... 220.


220 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 4 roses... and 7 more of them fancy dahlias... that's a lotta flowers!

So, 4 plus 7 is... 11 dahlias.

Then you gotta add the roses... 11 plus 4 is... 15!


15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now.

Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.

In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45


45 

"
"Okay, so Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so that's (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so that's 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since all four students scored 251 points, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

54 

"
"Okay, so she does crosswords for 10 minutes each and she did 3 of them, so that's 10 times 3, which is 30 minutes.

Then she does sudokus for 5 minutes each and she did 8 of them, so that's 5 times 8, which is 40 minutes.

Now we gotta add the time for crosswords and sudokus together, so 30 plus 40 is 70.


70 

"
"Okay, so Celine had 120 liters, then used 90 liters. That leaves 30 liters.

Then she got twice that much rain, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60 liters.

So now she has 30 plus 60 liters.


90 

"
"Okay, so Andy plants less petunias than geraniums.  

He plants 90 geraniums minus 40 petunias, so that's 50 petunias.

Now we add the geraniums and petunias together: 90 plus 50 equals 140.


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent some money, then spent a third of that again.  

Let's see... a third of 15000 is 5000 (cause 15000 divided by 3 is 5000).

So that's 15000 plus 5000...

15000 + 5000 = 20000


20000
"
"Okay, so Carlos pays 30 bucks every hour, and he uses it for 3 hours, so that's 30 times 3, which is 90 bucks.

Benji pays 18 bucks every hour and uses it for 5 hours, so that's 18 times 5, which is 90 bucks too.

Now we gotta add up what they both pay, so 90 plus 90 is 180.


180 

"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Car travel time:** Bus travel takes 6 days, and car travel takes half that time, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days by car.
* **Total travel time:** Going by bus takes 6 days, and returning by car takes 3 days, for a total of 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"
"Okay, so James starts with 40 water cards, but loses 8, so he has 32 left.

Then he gets 14 more grass cards, but that don't matter for the water ones.

So he has 32 water cards out of... lemme see... 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards total.

That's 32 out of 82... hmm...  

39%

"Okay, lemme see...

Burrito: $6.50
Meat: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Meal Upgrade: $3.00

Total food cost: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Gift card: -$5.00

Final cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute. Her mom is slower, so she only does 2 pieces a minute. Together, they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces every minute.

That means to do 360 pieces, it'll take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.


1 

"
"Okay, so there were 120 watermelons.

Ashlyn took 30% of them, which is like 30 out of every 100.  So she took 120 * (30/100) = 36 watermelons.

That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then she took 3/4 of those, which is like 60 out of every 84. So she took 84 * (3/4) = 63 watermelons.

That means there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left.


21 

"
"Okay, so he buys 12 cars times $20,000 each, that's $240,000.

Then he pays 10% tax, so that's $240,000 times 0.10, which is $24,000.

Now he adds the tax to the price of the cars: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

And finally, he pays $1000 for each car registration, so that's 12 cars times $1000, which is $12,000.

So, all together, he pays $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

"
"Okay, so there's 36 penguins, and some go swimmin' and some go eat.  

Let's see... one-third swimmin' is like 36 divided by 3, which is 12 penguins.

And another one-third eatin' is also 12 penguins.

So that's 12 plus 12, which is 24 penguins gone.

That means 36 minus 24 leaves us with... 12 penguins still sunbathing.

12 

"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and that's twice as much as his girlfriend.  So his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes a day.

That means together they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.

In a week, they eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

If each vine makes 3 tomatoes a week, Steve needs 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

"Hmm, let me see...

He starts with 25 pens.

He can make a new pen from every 5 empty ones.

90 

"
"Okay, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

That means they are 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old together.

"
"Okay, so lots of students, right?

First, some went out door A. That's 30% of 1000... hmm...  30 outta every 100, so 300 students went out A.

That leaves 1000 - 300 = 700 students left.

Then, most of them went out door B. Three-fifths of 700... that's like 3 groups of 100 and another 100... so 3 times 100 is 300 students out door B.

That means 700 - 300 = 400 students went out door C.


400 

"
"Okay, so John has lotsa candies, twice as much as Robert.  If John has 54, that means Robert has 54 split in half, which is 27 candies.

James has 6 more than Robert, so he has 27 plus 6, which is 33 candies.

John has 54 and James has 33, so John has 54 minus 33, which is 21 more candies than James.

"Okay, so Mike don't write to 2 people no more. That leaves him with 3 pen pals.

They each send 2 letters a week, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 letters.

And he writes 2 letters back, so that's 6 + 6 = 12 letters total.

Each letter is 5 pages, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 pages.

He writes a page every 6 minutes, so that's 60 x 6 = 360 minutes.

There's 60 minutes in an hour, so he writes for 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Okay, so Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes a day, and there are 30 days in the month, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

He also used 300 extra minutes.

So in total, he used 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

He started with 1000 minutes and used 750, so he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.

"Okay, let's try to figure this out.

* Kyle took 5 fries, and Billy took twice that, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.
* That's 5 + 10 = 15 fries gone from Griffin.
* So Griffin had 24 - 15 = 9 fries left.
* Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
* That leaves Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
*  Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"Hmm, snails and fishies... lotsa countin'!

Okay, so we got 32 snails minus 4 snails, that's 28 snails different.

"Okay, so let's break this down:

* Makeup cost per day: $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500
* Makeup cost per week: $1500/day * 4 days = $6000
* Total makeup cost for the movie: $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000
* Discount amount: $30000 * 0.10 = $3000

* Total sister's cookies: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
* Sue's calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories

* There are 20 students in each class, and 3 classes, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 students in the whole school.

*  Half the school is boys, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys.

* The first class has 15 girls, so there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in that class.

* The second class has 12 girls, so there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in that class.

"
"Okay, so Mr. Sylas has 200 cows at first (10 stalls * 20 cows). Then he gets 40 more cows. That makes 240 cows total (200 + 40).

He puts the new cows in all the stalls, so each stall gets 12 cows (40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall).

Now each stall has 32 cows (20 cows + 12 cows).

Eight stalls have 256 cows (32 cows * 8 stalls).


256 

"
"Okay, so he's got a bunch of coins and dollar bills.

Let's see... pennies are worth one cent each, so 100 pennies is a dollar.

Nickels are worth five cents, so 40 nickels is like having 40 times 5 cents... that's 200 cents, which is two dollars.

Dimes are worth ten cents, so 20 dimes is 20 times 10 cents... that's 200 cents, which is two dollars too!

And he has 40 dollar bills, so that's 40 dollars.

Now we add it all up: 1 dollar + 2 dollars + 2 dollars + 40 dollars = 45 dollars


45 

"
"Okay, so the tree is 20 feet tall, and each 10 foot part weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 sections.

So 20 sections times 400 pounds each is 8000 pounds.

But the termites ate some, so we gotta take some away. 30% of 8000 is... hmm... that's a lot of math.

Let's see... 30 out of every 100, so 30 times 80 is... 2400 pounds.

So the tree lost 2400 pounds.

That means the tree now weighs 8000 minus 2400... which is 5600 pounds.


5600 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

Eight books at fifty cents each... that's like... eight times fifty... which is... four hundred cents?

"Okay, so Andrea has a lotta apples, way more than Jamal.  And she has less bananas, but Jamal has more bananas than apples.  Hmm...

Let's see... Andrea has 52 apples, and that's 8 more than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the apples and bananas: 52 + 44 + 48 + 24 = 168


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs two cups for every 12 cookies.

Today she's makin' 36, which is three times more than 12. So that's 2 cups times 3, which is 6 cups.

Tomorrow she's makin' 30 cookies. That's two and a half times 12 cookies, so she needs 2 cups times 2.5, which is 5 cups.

In total, she needs 6 cups plus 5 cups.

6 + 5 = 11


11 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup.

That's like splittin' the pennies into three piles and takin' two of 'em.

So, we do 9,300 divided by 3, which is 3,100 pennies in each pile.

Then we take two piles, so that's 3,100 times 2, which is 6,200 pennies.

Now, we gotta figure out how many dollars that is.

There's 100 pennies in a dollar, so we do 6,200 divided by 100, which is 62 dollars.

8 

"
"Okay, so Carmen has a hundred bucks. Samantha has more than Carmen, so she has a hundred plus twenty-five, which is a hundred and twenty-five. Daisy has even more, fifty more than Samantha, so she has a hundred and twenty-five plus fifty, which is a hundred and seventy-five.

To find out how much they have together, we gotta add up all their money: a hundred plus a hundred and twenty-five plus a hundred and seventy-five.

That's... a lot of numbers!

Let me see...

...

"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000.

The broker wants 5% of that, so that's $350,000 times 0.05, which is $17,500.

Then there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of $350,000. That's $350,000 times 0.12, which is $42,000.

So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

That's more than Mrs. Cruz's $400,000 budget.

Let's see how much more... $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500


$9,500 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for a lot of money!

First, we gotta figure out how much he paid in fees.  

* Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is (3/100) * $400,000 = $12,000
* Brokerage fees: 5% of $400,000 is (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's add up all the money he had to pay out:

* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
* Loan repayment: $250,000

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract his expenses from the selling price to find his net proceeds:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000



$118,000
"
"Okay, so it takes longer to get to 400 degrees...

* 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes (cause 20 times 0.4 is 8).
* So it takes 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees (20 + 8).
* Cooking takes 23 minutes (28 minus 5).
* All together it takes 51 minutes (28 + 23). 


51 

"
"Okay, so he spent 5 bucks on each newspaper ad and got 50 of them. That's 5 times 50, which is 250 bucks.

Then he spent 75 bucks on each TV ad and got 15 of them. So that's 75 times 15, which is 1125 bucks.

Now we gotta add those two together: 250 plus 1125.

250 + 1125 = 1375


1375 

"
"Okay, so he's got a bunch of balls, right?  Half are golf balls, so that's 16 divided by 2, which is 8 golf balls.  And half of those are blue, so that's 8 divided by 2...

"Okay, so Mary got 300 M&Ms in the first bag.

The second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

762 

"
"Okay, so John has two houses, and each house has three bedrooms...

...and each bedroom has two windows... so that's 2 times 3 which is 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.

But wait, there's more! Each house also has 4 extra windows...

So each house has 6 plus 4 which is 10 windows.

Since he has two houses, that's 10 times 2 which is 20 windows total.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

She spends four dollars and twenty cents, plus nine dollars and forty-five cents, plus one dollar and thirty-five cents. That's a lotta numbers!

Let's see... four plus nine is thirteen... and twenty plus forty-five plus thirty-five... that's a hundred cents!  Which is a dollar. So thirteen dollars and a dollar is fourteen dollars and...

Wait, she paid twenty dollars!

So twenty minus fourteen... that's six dollars!


6 

"
"Okay, so Terri's sweater is big!

Let's see... the collar takes 1/10 of the body, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, so that's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

The body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That means the two sleeves use 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Each sleeve uses 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hmm, lemme see... 20 packets of tomatoes at 40 dollars each... that's a lotta tomatoes!  And 80 packets of celery... that's a whole lotta celery sticks!

*counts on fingers*

Okay, so tomatoes cost 20 times 40... that's 800 dollars! And celery is 80 times 30... that's 2400 dollars!

Now we gotta add those together... 800 plus 2400...

3200

"
"Okay, lemme see...

* **Scene 1:** The song has 54 lines, and the first scene has twice that, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But Sean only says a third of those, so that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

* **Scene 2:** This scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. And he says four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

* **Total:**  Now we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

"Okay, so Carly has lots of cards. Some have A, some have B, some have C...

Let's see... 2/5 of 80 is like cutting the cards into 5 piles and taking 2. That's 32 cards with A.

That leaves 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Half of those have B, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 cards with B.

Now there are 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.

5/8 of those have C, so that's 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards with C.

That means 24 - 15 = 9 cards have D.

"
"Okay, so he digs small holes fast, big holes take longer.  Lots of holes to dig!

Let's see... 30 small holes times 3 minutes each... that's 90 minutes.

And 15 big holes times 10 minutes each... that's 150 minutes.

All together that's 240 minutes of digging.

Now, how many hours is that?  There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is... 4 hours!

"Hmm, this is a tough one. Let me see...

Ruby's older, right? And in 9 years she'll be way older than Sam.

Let's see...

...

Sam is 3 years old now. 
"
"Okay, so Peter got some popsicles and ice cream.

Popsicles cost 20 times 25 cents, which is like 20 quarters. That's 5 dollars!

Ice cream bars cost 4 times 50 cents, which is like 4 half dollars. That's 2 dollars!

So, all together, he spent 5 dollars plus 2 dollars.


7 

"
"Okay, so the mamba has half the spots of the cobra, so it has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

All the cobras have 70 * 40 = 2800 spots.

All the mambas have 35 * 60 = 2100 spots.

Together they have 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450


2450
"
"Okay, so Maddy needs pizza for the team and the coaches and their guests.

Let's see... 12 team members plus 3 coaches is 15 people.

Then there's 12 team members times 2 guests each, that's 24 guests.

So, in total, there are 15 plus 24, which is 39 people.

Now, each pizza feeds 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas.

Finally, each pizza costs $15, so 13 pizzas times $15 each is...

195 



"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 gemstones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the gemstones.

The necklace is 25 inches long, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so that leaves 17 inches for the silver beads.

Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so Katerina uses 17 / (1/4) = 68 silver beads.


68 

"
"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories times 2 is 40. Braylen wrote 40 times 2 is 80. Margot wrote 60 times 2 is 120.  Now we add them all up: 40 plus 80 plus 120 is 240.

"Ann's brother is 18 years old now.  In three years he will be 21.

"
"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 5 times 25, which is 125 cents.

Then she has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 cents.

So she has 125 plus 20, which is 145 cents in total.

Now she spends 55 cents on pop, so we gotta take that away from her total.

145 minus 55 is 90.


90 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Three rows of 8 stars is 3 times 8, which is 24 stars.

Two rows of 6 stars is 2 times 6, which is 12 stars.

That's 24 plus 12, which is 36 stars.

So, 76 minus 36 is 40 stars left.

That means there are 40 divided by 5, which is 8 rows of 5 stars.

"
"Okay, so they got lots of heavy rocks, and the truck can only carry so much.

Let's see... 80 rocks times 75 pounds each... that's a lotta pounds!

*scribbles on a napkin*

Hmm, 80 times 75 is 6000 pounds.  

That's way more than the truck can carry!

So, how many trucks?

*counts on fingers*

6000 pounds divided by 2000 pounds per truck... that's 3 trucks!

"
"Okay, so the slow car is going half as fast as the fast car, so it's going 30 miles per hour.

To figure out how long it took the slow car, we gotta see how many hours it takes to go 480 miles at 30 miles per hour.

Hmm... 480 divided by 30... that's 16.

"
"Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

10 times the number of medals they have together is 39 * 10 = 390 medals.

"
"Okay, so there's lots of chocolate!

Let's see... 8 packets times 5 bars in each packet is 40 bars total.

The grown-ups get 4 adults times 6 bars each, that's 24 bars gone.

That leaves 40 minus 24, which is 16 bars for the kids.

Now we split those 16 bars between 8 children... that's 16 divided by 8.

"
"Okay, so Susan works from 8 to 11, that's like 3 hours.

But she takes a break for 30 minutes, so that's 30 minutes less.

So, she really works for 2 and a half hours.

That's 2 hours times 60 minutes, plus 30 minutes, so 150 minutes.

She earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we gotta divide 150 by 10.

That's 15 times $5.

15 times 5 is 75.


75 

"
"Okay, so Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has twice as many as Mike, so he has 42 points.

That's 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points total.

But wait, Mike and Tony get an extra point each because they have over 20 points.

So now they have 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"Here's how to solve this:

* The youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.
* Together they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.
* That leaves 15 - 12 = 3 oranges unwashed.

"
"Okay, so Darren does lots of exercises.

First day he does 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.

Second day he does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.

He does 50 - 10 = 40 squats.

He does 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Second day total is 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

Both days total is 170 + 200 = 370 exercises.

370 

"
"Okay, so they eat rice twice a day, lunch and dinner.

That's 0.2 kg per person per meal times 2 meals a day, so 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg per person every day.

And there are 5 people eating, so that's 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg of rice gone every day.

Now, we gotta see how many days the 42 kg bag lasts.  It's 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.

Finally, there are 7 days in a week, so 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.


3 

"
"Okay, so Sam wants to sell 120 crates.

He didn't work Monday or Friday, so that's two days less.

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, plus 15, 12, and 18 more. That's 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

So he sold 65 crates, and wanted to sell 120.

120 - 65 = 55


55 

"
"Okay, so Carmen bids after three other folks, and each bid goes up by 50 bucks.

That means the other bids were:

* $200 + $50 = $250
* $250 + $50 = $300
* $300 + $50 = $350

Since Carmen wins after the last bid, she paid $350.


350 

"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles a day.

He drives 60 miles a day times 5 days a week, that's 300 miles a week.

Then he drives 300 miles a week times 50 weeks a year, that's 15,000 miles a year.

He pays $2 a mile, so that's 15,000 times $2, which is $30,000.

He also gives his driver $150 a month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $150 times 12, which is $1,800.

So in total, he pays $30,000 plus $1,800, which is $31,800.


31800 

"
"Okay, so Peter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 on Monday.  That's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total.

"
"Okay, so Elise sold 45 books this year, and she has 50 left, so she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years.

She sold twice as many in the first year as this year, so she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.

That means she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

She makes 20 dollars per book, so she earned 110 * 20 = 2200 dollars in the second year.


2200 

"
"Okay, so Watson works a lot!

He makes $10 times 10 hours, so that's $100 a day.

Then he works 5 days a week, so that's $100 times 5, which is $500 a week.

And he gets an extra $300 every week 'cause the company is doing good.

So that's $500 plus $300, which is $800 a week.

April has 4 weeks, so he made $800 times 4, which is $3200.



3200

"Okay, so they make 60 loaves.

Two-thirds of them go in the morning, so that's 60 / 3 * 2 = 40 loaves.

"Okay, so ice cream is cheaper now, that's good!  And milk is cheaper too. Let's see...

Two ice creams cost 11 dollars each, so that's 11 times 2 which is 22 dollars.

The milk is 50 cents cheaper, so each one costs... hmm...  

Let's say the milk was a dollar, and now it's 50 cents cheaper, so it's 50 cents.

Four milks cost 50 cents times 4, which is 2 dollars.

So, two ice creams cost 22 dollars and four milks cost 2 dollars. That's 22 plus 2, which is 24 dollars.

But wait, the ice cream was more expensive before! It was 13 dollars, so two would be 26 dollars.

So, I saved 26 minus 24 dollars, which is 2 dollars!

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Suits cost:** 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
* **Suitcases cost:** 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150
* **Flight ticket cost:** (5 * $100) + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total spent so far:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
* **Money left after spending:** $6000 - $1950 = $4050
* **Money for gifts:** $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"Okay, so three people eat three eggs, that's 3 times 3, which is 9 eggs.

The other two people eat two eggs each, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 eggs.

In a week, that's 13 times 7, which is 91 eggs.

"
"Okay, so Quinn is the oldest, then Jane, then Trent.

Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

32 

"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, and six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.

The population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

That was six years ago, so now the population is double that.

60000 * 2 = 120000


120000 

"
"Okay, so there's lots of folks on that team!

Let's see... twice the defense is offense, and half the defense is special teams.  That means defense is like the middle part, right?

Hmm... gotta think...

Let's say defense is ""x"". Offense is ""2x"" and special teams is ""x/2"".

All together that's x + 2x + x/2 = 105

That's like 3.5x = 105

So, x, which is the defense, is 105 divided by 3.5

"
"Okay, so Martha invited lots of folks.

Let's see... 2 families with 6 people is 2 times 6, which is 12 people.

Then 3 families with 4 people is 3 times 4, which is 12 people too.

So that's 12 plus 12, which is 24 people.

But 8 people got sick, so that's 24 minus 8, which is 16 people.

And 1/4 of the sick people had other things to do, so that's 8 divided by 4, which is 2 people.

So 16 minus 2 is...

"
"Okay, so Solomon got 20 marbles from Johanna and had 50 already, so that's 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

His dad gave him 2/5 times the 20 marbles, so that's (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so 78 marbles weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.


156 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much water fits in the pool, right?

It's like a big box, so we multiply the sides together: 6 feet times 4 feet times 5 feet.

That's 120 cubic feet of water.

Now, it costs 10 cents for every cubic foot, so we gotta multiply that by 120.

10 cents times 120 is... 1200 cents.

That's the same as $12.00


12.00 

"
"Okay, so there's 3 times more girls than boys, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 girls.

And there's 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so that's 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered kids.

Now we add 'em all up: 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered kids = 123 kids

"Okay, so there were 25 men + 15 women = 40 people at the party.

Then 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

That means 40 - 10 = 30 people stayed.

We know 22 men stayed, so 30 - 22 = 8 women stayed.


8 

"
"Okay, so the magazine costs half of $4, which is $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so it costs $1.


1 

"
"Hmm, lotsa pencils!

Let's see... Jam has 26 pencils and 2 are loose, so that means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

If each box has the same amount, she has 24 / 3 = 8 pencils in each box.

Now, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils together.

If each box holds 8 pencils, they need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

"
"Okay, so Shannon wants her coffee cold, right?  She uses ice to make it cold, but the ice makes it weaker.  

Each ice cube makes it 13 degrees colder but weaker by 12 milliliters.  She wants it 65 degrees colder, so that's a lot of ice cubes!

She also puts in cream, which makes it weaker too.

Let me see... 65 degrees colder divided by 13 degrees per ice cube... that's 5 ice cubes!

So, that's 5 ice cubes times 12 milliliters weaker per cube... that's 60 milliliters weaker from the ice.

And then she adds 15 milliliters of cream, so that's another 15 milliliters weaker.

60 milliliters weaker from the ice plus 15 milliliters weaker from the cream... that's 75 milliliters weaker in total!



75 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

They get 1 new record for every 2 old ones.

"Okay, so there's 100 people workin' there.

Two-fifths of them are the young'uns, makin' 2000 bucks each. That's 40 of 'em.

The big shots make 400 more, so they get 2400 a month.

There's 60 big shots then, 'cause 100 minus 40 is 60.

So, the young'uns cost 40 times 2000, which is 80,000 bucks.

The big shots cost 60 times 2400, which is 144,000 bucks.

Add those together, and that's 224,000 bucks the company pays every month.

"Hmm, lemme see...

They got on at the terminal, then more got on, then some got off, then more got on...

20 people are going to the third stop...

Let's see... 20 minus the 8 that got on at the second stop... that's 12.

Then add the 7 that got off... 12 plus 7 is 19.

So 19 people were on the bus before the second stop.

Now take away the 5 that got on at the first stop... 19 minus 5 is 14.

That means 14 people musta been on the bus at the start!

"Okay, lemme see...

He starts with 24, eats 2, so that's 24 - 2 = 22.

Then he gives away 14, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 left.

He buys twice what he gave away, so that's 14 x 2 = 28 more lollipops.

Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more, so that's 36 - 3 = 33.

Then he eats 2 more, so he has 33 - 2 = 31.


31 

"
"Okay, so it goes up 1% every 3 minutes.

It needs to go up 40% more (100% - 60% = 40%).

So that's 40 times 3 minutes... which is 120 minutes.

Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is 2 hours.

"Erin has lotsa lollipops now! She got more from her mama. Then she gave some to Ella.  

17 

"
"Okay, so they spent $80 last time, so they got $1 off for every $20 they spent, which is $80 / $20 = 4 times. So they got $4 off.

This time they spent $43 and got $4 off, so it's $43 - $4 = $39.

But then they used a coupon for twice the amount of rewards, so that's $4 x 2 = $8 off.

So they paid $39 - $8 = $31.



$31 

"
"Okay, so Job A pays less per hour but more hours.  Job B pays more upfront but has taxes taken out.  

Let's see... Job A is $15 times 2000 hours... that's $30,000.  But wait, there's that 20% tax... so 20% of $30,000 is $6,000.  So Job A is really $24,000.

Job B is $42,000, but then we gotta take out that $6,000 property tax. That leaves $36,000. Then 10% tax on that... 10% of $36,000 is $3,600. So Job B is $32,400.

Job B pays more!  It's $32,400 minus $24,000...

$8,400

"Okay, so Furniture United wants more money up front, but Cozy Homes wants more money over time.  Let's see...

Furniture United: $1350 + ($350 x 6) = $1350 + $2100 = $3450

Cozy Homes: $1100 + ($250 x 9) = $1100 + $2250 = $3350

Hmm, looks like Cozy Homes is cheaper.

$3450 - $3350 = $100

"Okay, so he needs sugar for suckers and fudge.

Suckers need 30 ounces each, and he's makin' 8 batches, so that's 30 times 8... which is 240 ounces.

So, all together, he needs 240 plus 70 ounces.

That's 310 ounces.

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares times $8 a share, that's $64.

Then it goes up 50%, so that's half of $64, which is $32, added to the original price: $64 + $32 = $96.

Now it goes down 25%, so that's a quarter of $96, which is $24, taken away: $96 - $24 = $72.

"Hmm, lemme see...

Two groups are the same size, and the other one is smaller by 10.  That means if we take away 10 from the big groups, they'd all be the same.

So, let's say each big group has ""x"" students.  

That's 2x (for the two big groups) plus the small group.

2x + (x - 10) = 200

3x - 10 = 200

3x = 210

x = 70

So the small group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Okay, so Farmer Brown has lots of chickens and cows. He has more chickens than cows, like double!

Let's see... if we split the animals in half, that's 60 / 2 = 30.

So he has 30 cows and 30 x 2 = 60 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs, so that's 30 x 4 = 120 legs from the cows.

Chickens have 2 legs, so that's 60 x 2 = 120 legs from the chickens.

Now we add them up: 120 + 120 = 240 legs!

"Okay, so the frog weighs 50 pounds.

The beetle and toad weigh the same as the frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds.

The snake weighs 10 pounds more than the frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The bird weighs 20 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weight of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

Then she got twice that at her shower, so that's 24 x 2 = 48 more outfits.

Now she has 24 + 48 = 72 outfits.

Then her mom gave her 15 more, so she has 72 + 15 = 87 outfits.


87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, so that's 5000 divided by 5, which is 1000 more meters.

So now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.

June has 30 days, so he runs 6000 meters a day times 30 days, which is 180,000 meters.


180000 

"
"Juice Box B costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Juice Box C is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

"
"Okay, so we got tables with four legs and tables with three legs.  We gotta count all the legs!

* Forty tables with four legs is like 40 times 4, which is 160 legs.
* Fifty tables with three legs is like 50 times 3, which is 150 legs.

Now we add those together: 160 plus 150 is 310.


310 

"
"Okay, so Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Together they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

That leaves 36 - 27 = 9 cookies for Jenny.


9 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Two shirts cost 30 times 2, so that's 60 bucks.

But there's a discount, right? 40% off means he saves 40 out of every 100.

So, he saves 60 times 40 divided by 100... that's 24 bucks!

That means he pays 60 minus 24, which is 36 bucks.


36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make 10 tractors times $100 each, so that's $1000 a day.

Now they make 5 silos times $220 each, so that's $1100 a day.

That's $100 more than before.

$100 is what percent of $1000?  Hmm, that's like 100 out of 1000, or 10 percent!

10 



"
"Okay, so food costs $25 a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 x 4 = $100 a month on food.

Then you add the treats, which are $20, and the medicine, which is $100.

So that's $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 a month.

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so she spends $220 x 12 = $2640 a year on her dog.


2640 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

Yoga is one hour.

Cooking is three times yoga, so that's 1 times 3, which is 3 hours.

Cheese tasting is half an hour.

The museum is half of cooking, so that's 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 hours.

Errands are 2 hours.

Now we add it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours


8 

"
"April needs 30 * 2 = 60 pots for the roses.

That's 30 + 60 = 90 pots in total.

She has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over.

10 

"
"Okay, so Andrea had $36 and spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother.  

That means she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15.

So she saved $36 - $15 = $21.


$21 

"
"Okay, so John swam for 3 hours (half of 6).

The shows took 6 hours (3 shows times 2 hours each).

That's 9 hours total for boating, swimming, and shows (6 + 3 + 6).

If that's 30% of his time, then he was on vacation for 30 hours (9 hours / 0.30).

Sightseeing was 40% of his time, so he spent 12 hours sightseeing (30 hours * 0.40).


12 

"
"Okay, so Annabelle needs $400. She has $80 already.

Her first job pays her $10 times 20 hours, so that's $200.

Her second job pays her $5 times 15 hours, so that's $75.

So, she makes $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

That means she has $80 + $275 = $355 in total.

She needs $400 - $355 = $45 more.


45 

"
"Okay, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Both little trees are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall together.

The big tree is 17 x 2 = 34 feet tall.

34 

"
"Okay, so Dean spent money on cars and bears.  Cars cost two dollars, and he got six, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 dollars.  Bears cost one dollar each, and he got five, so that's 1 times 5, which is 5 dollars.  

So he spent 12 plus 5, which is 17 dollars.

His momma gave him 28, and he spent 17, so he had 28 minus 17, which is 11 dollars left.

Then his momma gave him 10 more dollars, so he has 11 plus 10, which is 21 dollars.


21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90.

Mini-golf is $5, and she needs to pay for herself too, so that's $5 x 2 = $10 for mini-golf.

Go-karts are $10 a ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 x 2 = $20.

So far, she's spent $10 + $20 + $5 = $35.

That leaves her with $90 - $35 = $55 for friends.

Each friend needs $5 for tokens, so she can invite $55 / $5 = 11 friends.


11 

"
"Okay, so Marisa gets 5 dollars a day.

Lollipops cost 25 cents each, and she buys 4, so that's 25 times 4 which is 1 dollar.

That means she saves 5 dollars minus 1 dollar, which is 4 dollars each day.

Over 5 days, she saves 4 dollars times 5 days, which is 20 dollars.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Billy has ten dollars, and the candy costs a dollar fifty a pound.  That means he can buy a lot of candy!  He buys some candy, then gets change back. He spends half his change on gumballs.  He got a lot of gumballs, forty of 'em! Each gumball costs a nickel.

Let's see... forty gumballs times five cents each... that's two dollars worth of gumballs!

So, he spent two dollars on gumballs, which is half his change. That means he got four dollars in change from the candy.

If he got four dollars back, and he started with ten dollars, he spent six dollars on candy.

Now, the candy costs a dollar fifty a pound... so he bought six dollars divided by a dollar fifty a pound...

4 



"
"Okay, so Carver is 45. That's 5 less than double his son's age.  So if we add 5 to Carver's age, that's double his son's age.

45 + 5 = 50

Now we gotta split that in half to find the son's age.

50 / 2 = 25


25 

"
"Okay, so the train goes a long way!

First, we gotta figure out how far it goes from the third city back to the first. It's 75 + 100 = 175 miles between the first two cities, and then 50 less, so that's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

So, each full trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 x 3 = 900 miles a day.

Now, to figure out how many days until it needs service, we divide the total miles before service by the miles per day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.



20 

"
"Okay, so a collie bed needs stuffin' in the middle of a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. That's like 8 and 2, so it's 5 pounds.

Now, 4 chihuahua beds need 2 pounds each, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 pounds.

And 3 collie beds need 5 pounds each, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 pounds.

Altogether, that's 8 plus 15, which is 23 pounds.


23 

"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles plus 10 extra miles, that's 210 miles going there.

Then he drives 240 miles back home.

To find out how long it takes, we gotta divide the miles by his speed.

Going there: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Going back: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

So, the whole trip took 3 hours plus 3 hours, which is 6 hours.


6 

"
"Okay, so there's 96 kids total, and 43 are girls. That means there's 96 - 43 = 53 boys.

Then 4 boys were gone, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"Let's see... twice the girls means there's 6 times 2 boys, which is 12 boys.

So there's 12 boys plus 6 girls, that's 18 kids in total.

18 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jane needs 42 points total. She got 15 plus 18, that's 33 points already.

So she needs 42 minus 33...

9 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

3 folks got the boot for no mask, that's like, a bad thing, right?

Four times that is 3 times 4, which is 12.

But then we gotta take away 5, so 12 minus 5 is 7.

So 7 got kicked out for stealin', which is also bad.

Three times that is 7 times 3, which is 21.

So 21 got kicked out for fightin' over stuff, that's crazy!

That's 3 plus 7 plus 21, which is 31 people.

50 minus 31 is 19.


19 

"
"Hmm, Erin has lots more points than Sara.  She has 14 now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8.  So Erin musta had some points before to get to 14. Let's see...

If Sara has 8 and Erin has three times that, that's like 8 + 8 + 8, which is 24.  But Erin only has 14 now, so she musta had 14 - 8 = 6 points before.


6 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, 44 seniors times $20 a frame is... $880.

Then, 20% of $20 is $4, so each frame costs $24 now.

That's $24 times 44 frames, which is $1056.

Two pins at $5 each is $10.

A quarter of 44 seniors is 11 seniors, so 11 cords at $12 each is $132.

Now, add it all up: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198


$1198 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So the wallpaper costs $400, and makin' it yourself saves ya 20%. That means ya save 400 times 0.20, which is 80 bucks.

So, if he saves 80 dollars, he spends 400 minus 80.

400 - 80 = 320


320 

"
"Okay, so they sold 14 pairs on Friday.

Then on Saturday they sold double, so that's 14 times 2 which is 28 pairs.

Sunday they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 28 divided by 2 which is 14 pairs.

But then 6 people brought shoes back, so we gotta take those away from Sunday's sales. That's 14 minus 6 which is 8 pairs.

Now we add up all the pairs sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday. That's 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturday, she dances twice as long as Tuesday, so that's 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.

In total, she dances 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours a week.

5 

"
"Okay, so they bought a bunch of stuff, but some of it was broke. They sent the broke stuff back.  We gotta figure out how much the good stuff cost.

Let's see... 40% was broke, so 60% was good, right?

That means they kept 60% of $400,000.

Hmm... 60% of something is like 60 out of every 100.

So, we do (60/100) * $400,000

That's $240,000


$240,000 

"
"Hmm, let me see...

Half of Mary's sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

So, 15 sheep give 1 kg each, that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

In total, Mary gets 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk.

"She had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls.

She cut each of those 6 rolls into 8 pieces.

"Okay, so half the class likes blue, that's 40 / 2 = 20 kids.

That leaves 40 - 20 = 20 kids who don't like blue.

One-fourth of them like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 kids.

That means 20 - 5 = 15 kids like yellow.


15 

"
"Lucy sold $56 worth of apples on Monday, and each apple costs $4, so she sold $56 / $4 = 14 apples on Monday.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the amount she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

In total, Lucy picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

"Hmm, lemme see... 10 pairs of socks is 10 times 2, which is 20 socks.

"Okay, so Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold. Anna has twice Axel's silver, so that's 50 times 2 which is 100 silver pesos.  Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 plus 40 which is 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the silver: 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150 silver pesos.

And all the gold: 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200 gold pesos.

Finally, add the silver and gold together: 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.

"
"Okay, so Millie spends $18 on stuff.

She makes 3 pitchers times 12 cups each, so that's 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36.

She spends $18 and makes $36, so she makes $18 profit.

She sells 4 cups an hour, so she's open for 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

So her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"
"If he sold 3/5 and has 12.8 left, that means 12.8 is the other 2/5 of his land.

So, if 2/5 is 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 hectares.

That means he had 5/5, or a whole, of 6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Girls in the choir:** 52 members / 2 = 26 girls
* **Girls who can't make it:** 26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

"Okay, so James gives Ms. Thompson a whole bunch of messages, 66 of 'em!  Then he gives Mr. Yu way less, like a third of what he gave Ms. Thompson.

So, a third of 66 is like splitting those messages into three groups, and Mr. Yu gets one of those groups.

That's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 messages for Mr. Yu.

Now we gotta add 'em up: 66 for Ms. Thompson plus 22 for Mr. Yu.

66 + 22 = 88

"Hmm, ratios are tricky...  Let's see... 5 plus 6 is 11, and 165 divided by 11 is 15. So, Betty has 5 times 15, which is 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 times 15, which is 90 popsicles.

90 minus 75 is 15.

"Okay, so Tim saves money on Hulu and Disney Plus cuz he gets them together.

That's 20% off of 10 plus 10, which is 20 bucks.

20% of 20 is 4 dollars.

So Hulu and Disney Plus cost him 20 - 4 = 16 bucks a month.

All together, his streaming costs 16 + 10 = 26 bucks a month.

He saves 60 - 26 = 34 dollars a month!

"Okay, so Mark needs lotsa flour, four times the normal amount! That's 3 cups times 4, which is 12 cups of flour.  He needs 4 times the milk too, so that's 1 cup times 4, which is 4 cups of milk.

Flour comes in 2-cup bags, so he needs 12 cups divided by 2 cups per bag, which is 6 bags of flour.

Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 4 cups divided by 2 cups per bottle, which is 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, so he needs 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, so Mel saves 5 hours of AC each day.

That's 5 hours less he's usin' that 900-watt thing.

So he saves 5 hours * 900 watts = 4500 watts each day.

Now, there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so he saves 4500 watts / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts each day.

Over 30 days, that's 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

"Okay, so Jane sees some zebras with stripes.  Let's see... two zebras got 17 stripes each, so that's 2 times 17, which is 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes. And another one with half of 36, which is 18 stripes.

So, all together, that's 34 + 36 + 18 stripes.

34 + 36 + 18 = 88

Now, how many zebras did she see?  She saw 2 + 1 + 1, which is 4 zebras.

So, to find the average, we gotta divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes divided by 4 zebras.

88 / 4 = 22

"Okay, so Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so that's 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00 for the meat.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00 for the cheese.

In total, he'll spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Let's see...

* He starts with 40 cannolis.
* He gets 60 more, so that's 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
* He has twice as much corn as cannolis at first, so that's 40 x 2 = 80 corns.
* But then he gets 40 fewer corns, so he has 80 - 40 = 40 corns.
* Now we add up all the cannolis and corns: 100 + 40 = 140

He did half on his way to and from school, so that's 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also did 1,000 steps with his friend.

That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps already.

He had 2,000 left to go, so he must have done 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps already.

So he did 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps on his jog.

"Okay, so Toby's book is 45 pages times 200 words a page, that's 9000 words.

If he reads 300 words a minute, it'll take him 9000 words divided by 300 words per minute, which is 30 minutes to read the whole book.

He needs to leave in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so he has 60 minutes minus 10 minutes, which is 50 minutes to read.

He only needs 30 minutes to read, so he'll be 50 minutes minus 30 minutes, which is 20 minutes early.

"Okay, so Sally got 2 pounds of taffy.  That's one pound at full price and one pound half off.  So the taffy costs $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.00

So all together she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

She started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, so she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.


$3.00

"Okay, so Tim buys one pack for $400 and another for twice that, so that's $400 * 2 = $800.

That means he spent $400 + $800 = $1200 on the two packs.

He gets a discount of 20%, so he saves $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

So the packs cost him $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the finale firework, he spends a total of $960 + $150 = $1110.


$1110

"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and she wants them to last a whole month, which is 30 days.

That means she needs 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

A dozen has 12 cookies, so she needs 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens of cookies.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  

Let's see... 5% of the candles are bad smellin', so that's 50000 times 0.05, which is 2500 candles.

But only 1% explode, so that's 50000 times 0.01, which is 500 candles.

Now, we gotta figure out how many are BOTH bad smellin' AND explode...

That's a tough one. I don't know how to do that part.

 

"
"Okay, so the blouses are 30% off, which means they cost less than $20 each.

First, we gotta figure out how much the discount is.  30% of $20 is like 30 out of every 100, so we do (30/100) * $20 = $6 off each blouse.

That means each blouse costs $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha buys 4 blouses, the total cost is $14 * 4 = $56.

"Joanne gets 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.

Joanne's sister gets 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees and 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Together they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

That means they got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

Joanne got 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hmm, heads and bumps... that's tricky.

Let's see... 25% of 4 is... hmm... that's like a quarter of 4, which is 1. So the soup cost 4 + 1 = 5 dollars.

He sells each card for a dollar fifty, so he needs to sell a hundred and fifty divided by a dollar fifty... which is a hundred cards.

But he keeps a third of them, so he sold two thirds of his cards.

If two thirds of his cards is a hundred, then one third is a hundred divided by two... which is fifty cards.

So he started with a hundred cards plus fifty cards... which is one hundred and fifty cards!

Bruce killed one-fifth as many as Walter, so that's 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

"Hmm, lemme see...

George had 500 cents to start, right?

He spent 1% of that, so he spent 500 x 0.01 = 5 cents on nothin'.

That means he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents on chips and candy.

Chips cost 40 cents each, and he got 3 bags, so that's 40 x 3 = 120 cents on chips.

That leaves 495 - 120 = 375 cents for candy bars.

Candy bars cost 75 cents each, so he bought 375 / 75 = 5 candy bars.

"Okay, so Billie's room is like a big box, right?  We know how much space is inside the box, but we wanna know how long all the sides are if we put them end to end.

First, we gotta figure out how wide the room is.  We know the space inside is 360 square feet, and it's 3 yards long.  A yard is 3 feet, so that's 9 feet long.

To find the width, we divide the space inside by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet wide.

Now we know it's 9 feet long and 40 feet wide. To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

Elizabeth got 1 red + 2 clear = 3 packs of beads.

Margareth got 3 blue + 4 red = 7 packs of beads.

4 packs * 20 beads per pack = 80 more beads.

"Okay, so Marcus's house gets hotter from the oven and then colder from the window.

The oven makes it hotter by 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 degrees hotter.

Now the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is like 30 / 10 = 3 sets of 10 minutes.

Each set of 10 minutes makes it 2 degrees colder, so 3 sets make it 2 * 3 = 6 degrees colder.

So the house is now 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Jon's run is 50 minutes, and he won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes longer.

That means James' run was 60 minutes.

"Okay, so Movie C is 1.25 hours long.  That's like an hour and a quarter, right?  So that's 60 minutes plus 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 80 divided by 4.  That's 20 minutes.

Each bail costs $3, so 8 bails is 8 times 3, which is $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has 6 times 5, which is $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, he has $6 left over.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Eggs from cases:** 4 dozen eggs * 12 eggs/dozen = 48 eggs
* **Total eggs:** 48 eggs + 2 eggs = 50 eggs
* **Trays:** 50 eggs / 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses
* **Trays:** 10 glasses / 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 and gets 26 more... that's 214 plus 26... which is 240.

Marcy has 225 and gets 10 more... so she has 225 plus 10... which is 235.

Now we gotta see how much bigger 240 is than 235.  That's 240 minus 235...

"
"Okay, so he bought the shoes for $576.

He sold 17 shoes for $20 each, so that's 17 * $20 = $340.

He had 48 - 17 = 31 shoes left.

He sold those for $25 each, so that's 31 * $25 = $775.

In total, he made $340 + $775 = $1115.

His profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"
"Okay, so Beatrice got some crayons. Six packs had eight crayons, so that's 6 times 8... which is 48 crayons.

Then she got four packs with sixteen crayons, so that's 4 times 16... which is 64 crayons.

Now we gotta add them together, 48 plus 64... that's 112 crayons!


112 

"
"Okay, so I saved $2 by not gettin' that fancy ticket. That means I spent $2 less than the $20 super ticket, so I spent $18.

I know the soda cost $3, so the popcorn musta cost $18 - $3 = $15.


15 

"
"Okay, so the price went up, and we gotta figure out how much Bentley paid.

Hmm... lemme see...

* The price went up by $20 per balloon.

* He bought a whole bunch of balloons, 170 to be exact.

* So, the extra cost for all those balloons is 170 times $20...

* That's 170 * 20 = 3400

* But we gotta add that to the original price, which was $900 for 20 balloons.

*  So, the total cost for Bentley is 3400 + 900 = 4300



4300 

"
"Okay, so it went fast for a while, then slower.  To find the average, you gotta add up the whole distance and divide by the whole time, right?

Let's see... 60 miles per hour for 2 hours is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Then 30 miles per hour for 1 hour is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

So, it went 120 + 30 = 150 miles total.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

150 miles divided by 3 hours is 50 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, so Jenna has less sapphires now, but more rubies.  

Let's see... 8 sapphires minus 3 sapphires is 5 sapphires.

She got 2 rubies.

5 sapphires times $800 each is $4000.

2 rubies times $1200 each is $2400.

$4000 plus $2400 is $6400.


$6400 

"
"Okay, so Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day. That's 8 apples together each day.

If they eat 8 apples a day for 30 days, that's 8 times 30.

240 

"
"Okay, so Bob has a lotta boxes for his plants.  Each one is like a big ol' rectangle, right?  

We gotta figure out how much dirt each box needs.  That's like figuring out how much space is inside.

It's 2 feet wide times 8 feet long times 2 feet tall... that's a lot of multiplyin'!

So each box needs 32 cubic feet of dirt.

And he has 10 boxes, so that's 32 times 10...  

That's 320 cubic feet of dirt total!

Now, each bag has 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 divided by 2...

That's 160 bags of dirt!

Each bag costs $12, so 160 times 12...

That's a lotta money!

1920



"
"Okay, so there's more green cards than red cards.  

Let's see... 60% of 15 red cards is like... a little less than half of 15, so maybe around 9 more green cards?

That means there's about 24 green cards.

Now, we add the red and green cards together, that's 15 + 24 = 39 cards.

So there's 39 yellow cards too.

In total, there's 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find out how many fairies joined.** Katelyn saw 50 fairies, and her friend saw half that amount, so 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined.

* **Step 2: Find the total number of fairies.**  There were 50 fairies to start, and 25 more joined, so there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

* **Step 3: Find out how many fairies are left.** 30 fairies flew away, so 75 - 30 = 45 fairies are remaining.

"
"Let's see... 8 puppies plus 12 puppies is 20 puppies.  And 3 plus 4 is 7 puppies with spots.

So, 7 out of 20 puppies have spots.

35% 



"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

* **Total weight:** 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

* **Trips:** 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

"
"Okay, so Grayson gets 2 cents for each can and she drinks 3 cans, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 cents from cans.

She gets 3 cents for each bottle and drinks 5 bottles, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 cents from bottles.

Together that's 6 + 15 = 21 cents each week.

In a month, she earns 21 x 4 = 84 cents.

"Hmm, lemme see...

So Ashley's pizza was 15 bucks, and she wants to give a tip that's like, one-fifth of that.  

That means we gotta divide 15 by 5, right?

15 / 5 = 3

So she should give the delivery guy 3 extra bucks.

That means the total she gives him is 15 + 3.

15 + 3 = 18

"Okay, so Miss Maria has lotsa basketball cards and baseball cards.

She has 6 decks times 25 cards in each deck, so that's 6 times 25 which is 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes times 40 cards in each box, so that's 5 times 40 which is 200 baseball cards.

That means she has 150 plus 200 which is 350 cards total.

She keeps 50 for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50 which is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 divided by 10 which is 30 students.

"Becky's apples cost 20 * $0.45 = $9.00.

After the discount, Becky paid $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Kelly's apples cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.

Kelly's discount is $10.00 * 0.10 = $1.00.

After the discount, Kelly paid $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Kelly paid $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00 more than Becky.

"Okay, so each room has two sheets, and then two times that many pillowcases, so that's four pillowcases. Then there's twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's eight towels.

"Okay, lemme see...

Frank starts with 200 shoes.

He gets 5 pairs on Monday, that's 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

Then he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, that's 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

And 30 pairs on Friday, that's 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So far, he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 200 shoes.

But then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Hmm, let me see...

If 9 are allergic to dairy and 6 to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both, that means some kids are counted twice.

So, we gotta take the 3 who are allergic to both outta the dairy group and the peanut group.

That leaves us with 6 dairy-only and 3 peanut-only.

Add those together with the double-allergy kids, and that's 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 kids with allergies.

Now, take that number away from the total kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

"Let's see... 3 groups times 200 people in each group is 600 people. Then we gotta add the tour guides, 3 groups times 7 guides is 21 guides.

"Okay, so the hotel is more expensive this weekend.  That means it costs $1500 plus 20% of $1500, which is $300 more. So the hotel costs $1800 a night.

For three nights, that's $1800 times 3, which is $5400.

Now we add the plane tickets, which are $5000 each, so that's $5000 times 2, which is $10000.

"Okay, so James runs a lot!  He runs 12 miles each day, and he does that 5 days a week.  That's a lot of miles!

To figure out how long he runs each day, we gotta divide the miles by his speed.  So 12 miles divided by 10 miles per hour is 1.2 hours.

Now, to find out how long he runs in a whole week, we multiply that by the number of days he runs. So 1.2 hours a day times 5 days a week is 6 hours.

"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse eats five pounds of oats at each meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 pounds times 2 meals, which is 10 pounds per horse per day.

Then, all four horses eat 10 pounds times 4 horses, which is 40 pounds a day.

Over five days, that's 40 pounds times 5 days, which is 200 pounds of oats.

Since each bag has 50 pounds, he needs 200 pounds divided by 50 pounds per bag, which is 4 bags.

The green apple gum was half the price of the grape gum, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.

"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours, which is 2 times 60 minutes, so that's 120 minutes.

Royce takes double Rob's time plus 40 minutes, so that's 120 times 2 plus 40 minutes.

120 times 2 is 240, and 240 plus 40 is 280.

"
"Okay, so Martha's makin' stuff for three little ones, right?  And each one needs a whole bunch of stuff.

Let's see...

* Hat: 2 skeins
* Scarf: 4 skeins
* Sweater: 12 skeins
* Mittens: 1 skein
* Socks: 2 skeins

That's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins for each kid.

And she's got three kids, so that's 21 x 3 = 63 skeins.


63 

"
"Okay, so Chris did 12 problems on Monday.

Then on Tuesday he did 12 x 3 = 36 problems.

That's 12 + 36 = 48 problems done in total.

He had 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday he did 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That means he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

"
"Hmm, let's see...

He got 36 red ones and can fit 6 in a row, so that's 36 divided by 6... which is 6 rows of red.

He got 24 blue ones and can fit 8 in a row, so that's 24 divided by 8... which is 3 rows of blue.

"
"Hmm, let's see... 27 cups of raisins... and cookies need 3/4 of a cup...  

If she splits the raisins evenly, that means each thing gets 27 divided by 3, which is 9 cups.

So, she can make 9 cups of raisins / 3/4 cup per batch = 12 batches of cookies.

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 watts a day, and the new thing uses 2 watts a day. That's 12 + 2 = 14 watts a day.

A week has 7 days, so she uses 14 watts a day times 7 days = 98 watts a week.

Each watt costs $1.50, so 98 watts times $1.50 = $147.00 a week.

Before the new thing, she used 12 watts a day times 7 days = 84 watts a week.

That's 84 watts times $1.50 = $126.00 a week.

So the difference is $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00


$21.00 

"
"Well, if one person takes 5 days to do half a house, that means it takes them 10 days to do a whole house.

If you got 5 people, they could probably do it faster, right?  

Let's see... 10 days divided by 5 people is 2 days.

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 less chairs than sofas, so she has 20 - 2 = 18 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 18 * 3 = 54 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 less sofas than chairs, so she has 54 - 2 = 52 sofas.

Together they have 20 + 52 = 72 sofas.

Together they have 18 + 54 = 72 chairs.

In total, they have 72 + 72 = 144 sofas and chairs.

144 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Tom spent $48 and the CD was $4.  That means the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.

If he didn't buy the headphones, he'd have $44 more.

Since each CD costs $4, he could buy $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs.


11 

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out 4 hours a week most of the time. That's like 4 times 6 weeks, which is 24 hours.

Then he did 5 hours for two weeks, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 hours.

And one week he did 6 hours.

So, all together, it's 24 + 10 + 6.


30 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

* First, 8 people leave, so there's 48 - 8 = 40 left.
* Then 8 times 5 is 40, so 40 people get on.
* Now there's 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.
* Then 21 people leave, so there's 80 - 21 = 59 left.
* 21 divided by 3 is 7, so 7 people get on.
* That means there's 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus.

"
"Okay, so Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years, so right now he's 22.

In 8 years, Jame will be 30 (22 + 8).

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 60 (30 x 2).

His cousin will be 55 in 8 years (60 - 5).

That means his cousin is 47 now (55 - 8).

So the cousin is 25 years older than Jame (47 - 22).

"
"Okay, so Errol's computer cost $1100.

The printer cost $1100 - $400 = $700.

That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.

He spent $2400 total, so the monitors cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.

Since he bought two monitors, one monitor cost $600 / 2 = $300.

"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Boys' shells:** Each boy brought 60 shells.
* **Girls' extra shells:** The girls brought 4 times the boys' amount, so 60 * 4 = 240 extra shells.
* **Girls' total shells:** The girls brought the boys' amount plus extra, so 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

**Answer:** 300

"Okay, so...

* Book 2 is 50 mm.
* Book 3 is 5 mm less than Book 2, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm.
* Book 4 is twice as thick as Book 1, so it's 31 x 2 = 62 mm.

Now let's add up all the books: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out the tip first. 20% of 50 bucks is like... hmm... 20 outta every 100, so that's 10 bucks.

Then we split the bill in half, so that's 50 bucks divided by 2, which is 25 bucks each.

But I gotta add that extra tip, so it's 25 plus 10...

"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, first, each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy has $6 + $5 = $11.

Then he gets $11 + $10 = $21.

He spends $21 - $8 = $13.

And then he triples that, so he has $13 x 3 = $39.

"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month.

That's a lot of money!

He wants to save double in the second half of the month.

Hmm, let's see...

There are 30 days in April, so half the month is 15 days.

So he needs to save $1125 divided by 30 days, which is $37.50 per day.

But he wants to save double that in the second half, so that's $37.50 times 2, which is $75.

"Okay, so Verna buys some apples, oranges, and peaches.  

Let's see... three apples cost 3 times $1.50, which is $4.50.

Five oranges cost 5 times $0.80, which is $4.00.

Six peaches cost 6 times $0.75, which is $4.50.

Now we add up all the fruit: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

She gave $20.00 and the fruit cost $13.00

So, $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

"Jairus earns more money per task, so he'll make more overall.

Let's see how much Jairus makes: 20 tasks * $0.8 per task = $16

To find the difference, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings: $16 - $10 = $6

"Hmm, let me see...

If Jeff gets 4 times more than Brad, that means we gotta split the money into 5 parts.

One part for Brad, and four parts for Jeff.

So, each part is worth 100 dollars divided by 5 parts, which is 20 dollars.

Jeff gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 times 20 dollars.

"Okay, so Elise writes the alphabet twice, that's 26 letters times 2, which is 52 letters.

Then she writes half the alphabet, so that's 26 letters divided by 2, which is 13 letters.

So Elise wrote a total of 65 letters.

He also wants two pens, so that's 2 times $0.25, which is $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

So, all together, before the discount, it's $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

But wait, there's a discount! 10% of $30.00 is $3.00.

* 10 packs of fries at $0.30 each, so that's 10 * $0.30 = $3
* 5 cans of drinks at $2 each, so that's 5 * $2 = $10

Three miles on a hot day would take 3 times that, so 3 times 34 is 102 minutes.

"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals.

Mark scored 20 less than Richie, so he scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

He buys wooden figures for 4 days, and each one costs $5, so he buys $10 / $5 = 2 wooden figures each day.

That's 2 figures a day times 4 days, so he gets 2 * 4 = 8 wooden figures.

He has 7 days - 4 days = 3 days left to buy plastic figures.

Each plastic figure costs $2, so he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic figures each day.

That's 5 figures a day times 3 days, so he gets 5 * 3 = 15 plastic figures.

In total, he has 8 wooden figures + 15 plastic figures = 23 figures.

Taking up the old carpet costs $4 per square foot, so that's 216 times $4, which is $864.

Putting down the new carpet costs $34 per square foot, so that's 216 times $34, which is $7344.

Her friend had 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 plus 20 which is 44 dishes.

Now we add up all the cups: 12 plus 40 is 52.

"Okay, so Pete needs to figure out how much each contact costs.

First, he gets a discount on the boxes, so each box costs $100 - ($100 * 0.10) = $90.

He buys two boxes, so that's $90 * 2 = $180.

Each box has 90 contacts, and he bought two boxes, so he has 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

That means each contact costs $180 / 180 = $1.00. 


$1.00

"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday plus 1 hour on Sunday, that's 3 hours total.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.

That means John worked a total of 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

Let's see... it starts at 4 feet and needs to be taller than 20 feet.

Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

"Okay, so John eats double the cup of mushrooms every day, so that's 200 grams.

If 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams has double the protein.

So that's 3 grams times 2, which is 6 grams of protein a day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so he gets 6 grams a day times 7 days, which is 42 grams of protein.

"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let me see...

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he's gotten 5 years older. So, if he's twice as old now, he must be 10 years old now.

In 3 years, he'll be 13.

"
"Okay, so George needs two implants at $2000 each, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000.

Then he wants a fancy crown for one, which is another $500.

So the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He's already paid $600, so he still owes $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the money he owes by how much he makes per hour: $3900 / $15 = 260.


260 

"
"Hmm, angles in a triangle... that's like a slice of pie, right?  

If one slice is small, and another is twice as big, and the last one is three times the small one... that's a lot of pie!

Let's see...

* Small slice:  Let's call it ""x""
* Medium slice: 2x
* Big slice: 3x

All the slices together make a whole pie, which is 180 degrees. So:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

That's 6x = 180

So, x must be 30 degrees (180 divided by 6).

The biggest slice is 3x, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

90 



"
"Okay, so Colby's got a bunch of coins, right?  Let's see... quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters is 8 times 25, which is 200 cents. Dimes are 10 cents, so 6 dimes is 6 times 10, which is 60 cents. Nickels are 5 cents, so 14 nickels is 14 times 5, which is 70 cents. And pennies are just 1 cent, so 15 pennies is 15 cents.

Now we gotta add all that up: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

But gumballs cost 5 cents each, so we gotta see how many times 5 goes into 345.  That's 345 divided by 5, which is...

69 



"
"Okay, so... dogs got four legs, cats got four legs, and birds got two.

Let's see... 5 dogs times 4 legs is 20.

Then 2 cats times 4 legs is 8.

And 10 birds times 2 legs is 20.

Now we add it all up: 20 plus 8 plus 20 is... 48!


48 

"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.

He goes up by 50%, which is like half of 8, so that's 4 more pounds.

That makes it 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

But then he goes down 2 pounds, so it's 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"
"Okay, lemme see...

* Year 1: He gets 5 games + 1 game a month for 12 months = 17 games
* Year 2: He gets 17 games + 2 games a month for 12 months = 37 games
* Year 3: He gets 37 games + 4 games a month for 12 months = 85 games
* Christmas games: 5 games a year for 3 years = 15 games

Now, let's add all the games together: 17 + 37 + 85 + 15 = 154

"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That means it goes fast!  To go another 2000 miles, it's gotta go a lot further.

Let's see... 2000 miles is more than 1200 miles, so it'll take more than 3 hours.

Hmm...

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lotta chocolate, right? Marissa makes less, but still a good amount.  They work a long time, so that's a lot of chocolate!

Let's see...

* Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in one hour he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.
* Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in two hours, so she makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds in an hour.
* Together in an hour they make 60 + 90 = 150 pounds.
* In 12 hours they make 150 * 12 = 1800 pounds.

"
"Okay, so Howard spends $8 on Monday.

Then on Tuesday, he spends twice that, so that's $8 x 2 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends four times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 x 4 = $64.

In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100 and spent $88, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Patrick sold a lotta lemonade!

First, he sold 15 cups an hour for 4 hours, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 cups.

Then he sold 10 cups an hour for 2 hours, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 cups.

In total, he sold 60 plus 20, which is 80 cups.

Now, for the first 4 hours, he made 15 cups times $0.50, which is $7.50 each hour.  So for 4 hours, he made $7.50 times 4, which is $30.

For the next 2 hours, he made 10 cups times $0.60, which is $6.00 each hour. So for 2 hours, he made $6.00 times 2, which is $12.

Altogether, he made $30 plus $12, which is $42.

"Okay, so Jeremy drives a lot!

Let's see... 400 miles a month times 12 months is 4800 miles a year.

Then we gotta figure out how many times the tires spin in a year. 4800 miles a year times 725 rotations per 2 miles is... hmm...  carry the one...  that's a lot of rotations!

Now we divide the total rotations a tire can handle by the rotations per year. 10,440,000 divided by...  

*counts on fingers*

...that's a lot of years!

"
"Okay, so Jackie gets half as many washes, right?

That's 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes.

So each wash costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40

Now we gotta figure out how much one pump costs.

Since she's only using one pump, it's just $0.40.

But the question wants the answer in cents, so we gotta multiply by 100.

$0.40 x 100 = 40 cents

"
"Okay, so Joe wants to buy a shirt and shorts.

The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35, so that's $25 + $35 = $60.

But wait, there's a sale! 30% off means he saves some money.

Hmm, 30% of $60 is...  I dunno, that's a tricky one.

Let's just say he saves a good chunk of change.

So, $60 minus the discount... and then he has to pay tax too.

This is hard! I'm not good at math.

...

I give up. 



"
"Okay, so he needs butter for 4 dozen croissants a day, and he's makin' them for a whole week. That's like 4 times 7, which is 28 dozen croissants.

And each dozen needs 1/4 pound of butter, so that's 28 times 1/4...

Let me see... 28 divided by 4 is 7.

"
"Okay, so Monica's street is shorter.  Lewis' street is way longer.  Gotta figure out how much longer, then times that by the price.

490 - 150 = 340 meters longer

340 meters * $194 per meter =  $65960


$65960 

"
"Okay, so John had money for 5 months, then needed 10 times longer, so that's 5 months * 10 = 50 more months.

That's a total of 5 + 50 = 55 months.

The extra months cost 50% more, so each month cost $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000.

Those extra months cost $150,000 * 50 = $7,500,000.

In total, his research cost $100,000 * 5 + $7,500,000 = $7,650,000.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Player 1:** 6 ounces

"
"Okay, so Gary washes clothes two times a week, and each time he uses a whole bunch of water, like 20 gallons!  And each gallon costs some money, 15 cents I think?  

So, he uses 20 gallons times 2 washes, that's 40 gallons a week.

There are, like, 52 weeks in a year, right? So that's 40 gallons times 52 weeks, which is a lot of gallons!

Then you gotta multiply that by the price, 15 cents.

...

40 * 52 * 0.15 = 312 


312 

"
"Okay, so she spent $10 on the tank. Then $2.50 times 2 is $5 for rocks. Coral is $2 times 3, so that's $6. Fish are $0.50 times 20, which is $10. And the food is $2.

Now we add it all up: $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.

"
"Okay, so Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works for 10 hours a day. That means he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat every day.

The bull weighs 750kg, so it will take him 750 / 150 = 5 days to sell all the meat.


5 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

So there's 4 rows times 18 seats each, that's a lotta seats! 4 times 18 is 72 seats.

The bosses took a quarter of them, so that's 72 divided by 4, which is 18 seats.

That leaves 72 minus 18, which is 54 seats left.

The parents took a third of those, so that's 54 divided by 3, which is 18 seats.

That means there were 54 minus 18, which is 36 students.



36 

"
"Okay, so we got lotsa poles with lights on 'em.

Let's see... 6 poles at each corner, and 4 corners, that's 6 times 4, which is 24 poles.

Each pole has 4 lights, so that's 24 times 4, which is 96 lights.

But 20 lights are busted, so we take away 20 from 96.

96 minus 20 is 76.

"
"Let's see...

One DVD can be played a whole bunch of times, 1000!  The first one's been played a lot, 356 times. The other one not so much, only 135 times.

So, the first one can be played 1000 - 356 more times. That's 644 times.

The second one can be played 1000 - 135 more times. That's 865 times.

Now we gotta add those together... 644 + 865...

That's a lot of playin'!

"
"Okay, so John went to therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. That's 2 times 6 which is 12 times he went.

Each time he went it was for 2 hours, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 hours total.

Each hour costs $125, so 24 times 125 is...

3000 

"
"Okay, so Jim chews gum at school for 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum.

Then he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces chewed.

He started with 20 pieces and chewed 6, leaving him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

He gives half to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

That leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.


7 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... if she's gonna be 16 in 12 years, that means she's 16 - 12 = 4 years old now.

So in 4 more years, she'll be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.

"Hmm, lemme see...

Baseball coach spent 9 times 3 dollars, that's 27 dollars.

"Okay, so Arianna has a lot of flowers!

Let's see... 10 rows times 20 flowers is 200 flowers.

Then, 4 out of every 5 bloomed, so... hmm... that's like cutting the 200 in half and then some.

200 divided by 5 is 40, and then times 4 is 160.

Let's see... 20 kb per second... that's like, tiny little bits of information flying around every second.

But she wants to know how much stuff she can download in a whole hour, right?

Hmm... there's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour... so that's a lot of seconds!

And remember, 1 Mb is like a big bunch of those kb things... 1000 of them, to be exact.

So, gotta do some math...  

...

20 kb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

"
"Okay, so they towed ten cars a day for three days, that's 10 x 3 = 30 cars.

Then they towed four less each day for the rest of the week, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 cars a day.

There are seven days in a week, so they towed cars for 7 - 3 = 4 more days.

So that's 6 x 4 = 24 cars.

Now we add the two amounts together: 30 + 24 = 54 cars.

"Hmm, lemme see...

Adam needs to grow 4 feet, which is 48 inches. He's 40 inches now, so he needs to grow 8 more inches.

"
"Okay, so James sold some cars.

He sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so that's 10 times 25,000... which is 250,000 dollars.

The company paid 30% for the cars, so that's 30 out of every 100 dollars.  

30% of 25,000 is... hmm... that's tricky.  

Let's see... 30% is like 30 out of 100, so it's like 30 dollars for every 100 dollars.

So 30% of 25,000 is...  

(I'm gonna need a pencil and paper for this one...)

Okay, I got it! 30% of 25,000 is 7,500 dollars.

So the company spent 7,500 dollars on each car.

Since he sold them for 25,000, he made a profit of 25,000 minus 7,500... which is 17,500 dollars on each car.

He sold 10 cars, so his total profit is 17,500 times 10... which is 175,000 dollars.

He gets 10% commission, so that's 10 out of every 100 dollars.

10% of 175,000 is...

(Back to the pencil and paper...)

10% of 175,000 is 17,500 dollars.

"
"Okay, so there's a big wave, and some surfers are tryin' to ride it.

Only a quarter of them can stay up, so that's 100 divided by 4, which is 25 surfers.

Then, 60% of those are women, so that's 25 times 0.6, which is 15 women.

That means 25 minus 15 is 10 men can stay up.

"Okay, so the gold one is like, most of the price of the diamond one, right?  And the silver one is cheaper than the gold one.

Let's see... the gold one is 4/5 times $2000, so that's... hmm... 

*counts on fingers*

That's $1600 for the gold one.

And the silver one is $400 less than that, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Now we add them all up: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800


$4800 

"
"Okay, so Max got 16 snowflake stamps.

He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so that's 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add up all the stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let me see...

Tom's going faster, so he's gonna catch up.  

Gotta figure out how much faster he's going... 70 minus 55 is 15 miles per hour faster.

So, for every hour, Tom gains 15 miles on Bob.

Bob's got a 75 mile head start...

So, it'll take Tom... 75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour...

"
"Okay, so Manny's classes cost $60 total and he can't spend more than $10 per class.  If he goes to all 10 classes, that's $100.  That's more than his parents want to spend.

Let's see... if he misses one class, that's $10 less, so it would be $90. Still too much.

Hmm, if he misses two classes, that's $20 less, so it would be $80.  Still too much.

If he misses three classes, that's $30 less, so it would be $70. Still too much.

If he misses four classes, that's $40 less, so it would be $60. That's just right!

So Manny can miss 4 classes.

"
"Okay, so Tim gets more money now.  

First, we gotta figure out how much extra he gets from the raise. That's 5% of $20000, which is like 5 out of every 100 dollars.

So, 5/100 * $20000 = $1000 more each month!

His bonus is half his salary, so that's $20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, his new monthly pay is $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000

In a year, he makes $31000 * 12 = $372000


$372000 

"
"Okay, so James buys lots of fancy clothes!

Let's see... the pants cost way less than the suits, they're only 1/5 the price, so that's $750 / 5 = $150 per pair of pants.

He buys 10 suits, so that's 10 * $750 = $7500 for the suits.

The pants cost $150 each and he gets 10 of those, so that's 10 * $150 = $1500 for the pants.

Now for the shirts, he gets 3 for each suit, and he has 10 suits, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 shirts.

Those shirts cost $60 each, so 30 * $60 = $1800 for all the shirts.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

That means he'll finish 10 days before the deadline (30 - 20 = 10).

"
"Okay, so he buys the plane for a whole lotta money, right?  Then he pays some more money every month to keep it in a big shed. And then he pays even more for the plane to fly!

Let's see... he pays double the shed money for fuel, so that's 5000 times 2, which is 10,000.

So every month he spends 5000 + 10000, which is 15,000.

There are 12 months in a year, so that's 15,000 times 12, which is 180,000.

Don't forget the plane cost 150,000 to start with!

So all together, it cost him 150,000 + 180,000.

That's a lot of money!

330,000

"Pork took 50 minutes to cook (30 minutes + 20 minutes).

Beans took 40 minutes to cook (50 minutes + 30 minutes) / 2.

All together it took 120 minutes (30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes).

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much the different nut mixes cost.

First mix:

* Almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
* Walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
* Total: $5 + $5 = $10

Second mix:

* Almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
* Walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
* Total: $2 + $5 = $7

Now we gotta see how much more the first mix costs than the second:

* $10 - $7 = $3

"Okay, so the fancy coffee is $5 plus 20% of $5, which is like... a dollar more? So the fancy coffee is $6 a pound.

He needs 7 pounds for the week, so that's 7 times $6, which is... hmm... 42 dollars.

And then the donut is 2 dollars.

So it's 42 plus 2...


44 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Chips cost $2 x 2 = $4.00

Chicken is $8.00

Soda is $1.00

So that's $4 + $8 + $1 = $13.00

That means the apple pie cost $20 - $13 = $7.00


$7.00 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

He delivers 600 in total, and we know 198 go to District A and 209 to District C.  

So, 198 plus 209 is... 407.

That means he delivers 600 minus 407 to District B.

600 minus 407 is... 193.


193 

"
"Okay, so he goes to class 4 times a week times 2 hours each time, so that's 8 hours a week.

Then he does that for 6 weeks, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 hours total.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so we gotta divide 48 by 1.5.

That's 32 recipes!

"
"Okay, so there's a bunch of teachers playin' basketball, right?

Most of 'em teach history, but some teach math.  

Those history teachers, they sleep a lot, like everyone else.

Let's see... 60% of 150 teachers is a lotta history teachers.

That leaves the rest for math teachers.

And they sleep for 6 hours, just like the history folks.

Hmm, gotta add up all those sleepin' hours for the math teachers...

"
"Okay, so Kassidy has 3/4 times Aurelia's money, which is $120. So Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

Now, let's add up all their money: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360

Finally, they share the money equally, so each person gets $360 / 3 = $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so the game is normally 4 times 12 minutes, which is 48 minutes. Then they played 5 more minutes.

"Hmm, lemme see...

Adam bought 7 of the first candy and they cost 50 cents each, so that's 7 times 50 cents... which is 350 cents.  That's like $3.50.

Then he got 10 of the other candy, and those are 75 cents each, so that's 10 times 75 cents... which is 750 cents. That's $7.50.

So all together, the candy cost $3.50 plus $7.50, which is $11.

He gave the man $15, so he should get $15 minus $11... which is $4.

"
"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.

That means she had 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days.

She had 8 good days at the start, so after those 8 good days, she had 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.

Then she had 3 more good days, so now she has 4 + 3 = 7 good days left.


7 

"
"Okay, so Janey has a bunch of books, way more than Sally.  

Let's see... Janey has 21 books, and that's 3 more than double what Sally has.  

So if we take away those extra 3 books Janey has, that leaves us with 18.

That 18 must be double what Sally has.

So Sally has 18 split in half, which is 9 books.

20 feet is a lot of bamboo!  

If it grows 30 inches a day, gotta figure out how many inches it needs to grow more...

600 inches minus 20 feet...

20 feet is 240 inches, right?

So, 600 minus 240 is 360 inches.

Now, 360 inches divided by 30 inches a day...

* He starts with 4 dogs and 4 toys.
* Then there are 8 more dogs, so that's 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
* He buys toys for those 12 dogs.
* Then there are twice as many more dogs, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 dogs!
* He buys toys for those too.
* But then 3 dogs leave, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

So he needs toys for 21 dogs.

"
"Okay, so Dylan put in a bunch of money first. Then Frances put in most of what was left. That means Skyler only had a little bit left to put in.

Let's see... Dylan put in 2/5 of $1200...  

*counts on fingers*

That's $480.

So then there was $1200 - $480 = $720 left.

Frances put in 2/3 of that, so she put in...

*counts on fingers again*

$480.

That means Skyler only had to put in $720 - $480 = $240.

"Okay, so Jack and 8 other adults is 9 people in total.

Each person weighs 80 kg, so 9 people weigh 9 * 80 = 720 kg.

"Okay, so Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now let's add them all up: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298


298 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

So she made it longer by half, and then added some lace.

If it's 140cm now, and she added 20cm of lace, that means it was 140 - 20 = 120cm before the lace.

That 120cm is 150% of the original length, 'cause she added 50%.

So, to find the original length, we gotta figure out what 100% is.

If 150% is 120cm, then 100% is 120 / 1.5 = 80cm.



80 

"
"Okay, so he takes 60 minutes in slow mode and 40 minutes in fast mode.

He does half in each, so that's 60 / 2 = 30 minutes in slow mode and 40 / 2 = 20 minutes in fast mode.

Bananas cost $2 each kilo, and she gets 2 kilos, so that's $2 x 2 = $4.

"Okay, so John has lots of homework!

Let's see... 20 minutes plus 40 minutes plus 20 minutes is 80 minutes of homework.

Three hours is a long time, that's 3 times 60 minutes, so 180 minutes.

John has 180 minutes before dinner and takes 80 minutes for homework.

That means he has 180 minus 80 minutes to nap.

100 



"
"Okay, so Manolo buys five lollipops at 40 cents each, that's 5 times 40 cents, which is 2 dollars.  

That means the candies cost 3 dollars and 20 cents minus 2 dollars, which is 1 dollar and 20 cents.

So, 10 lollipops would cost 10 times 40 cents, which is 4 dollars.

And 10 candies would cost 10 times the price of one candy, which is 1 dollar and 20 cents times 10, which is 12 dollars.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost 4 dollars plus 12 dollars, which is 16 dollars.

"Okay, so the vaccines cost 20 dollars each, so that's 20 times 2 which is 40 dollars.

The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, and we know the vaccines are 40 dollars, so the whole bill is gonna be bigger than that.

Let's see... 60% of something is like 60 out of 100, so we gotta figure out what number 60 is 60% of.

Hmm, this is tricky. I don't know how to do percentages real good.

Maybe someone else can help me with this one.



"
"Okay, so bananas cost twice as much as apples, which are $0.50. So bananas cost $0.50 x 2 = $1.00 each.

Oranges cost three times as much as bananas, so they cost $1.00 x 3 = $3.00 each.

Now, let's figure out the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, add up the cost of all the fruit: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

* Green: 18 + 6 = 24
* White: 24 - 12 = 12

Now we add all the squares together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hmm, lemme see...

They got 8 high chairs, and that's for the babies.

The grown-ups need regular chairs, and there's 5 times more of them than high chairs.

So that's 8 times 5, which is 40 regular chairs.

Now, all together they got 40 plus 8, which is 48 chairs.

They need chairs for 42 grown-ups and 15 babies, so that's 57 people.

They need 57 minus 48, which is 9 more chairs.

"
"Okay, so half the deer are bucks, that's 50 divided by 2, which is 25 bucks.

Then 20 percent of those bucks are 8 pointers, so that's 25 times 0.20...

25 times 0.20 is 5.


5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Betty got 30% more points than Adam, who has 50. That means Betty got 50 + (30/100)*50 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta got 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"
"Let's see...

Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids.

Each of them has 3 kids, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 grandkids.

"
"Okay, so Greta puts half her money away for later, that's $2400 / 2 = $1200.

Then she spends some on her car, which is $2400 * 0.20 = $480.

So, she spent a total of $1200 + $480 = $1680.

That means she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left.


$720 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 20 pencils and 4 are gone... that leaves 16 pencils.

Pairs means two pencils together, right?

"
"Okay, so they got lots of fireworks, and Hannah sees some from her house and some from her backyard.

Let's see... 15 boxes times 20 fireworks is 300 fireworks in the city.

Hannah sees 40% of them, so that's like 300 times 0.4, which is 120 fireworks.

Then she sets off 3 boxes times 5 fireworks, that's 15 fireworks in her backyard.

So, all together, she sees 120 plus 15 fireworks.

"
"Okay, so there's Aiden plus 12 friends, that's 13. Then 7 more friends join, so that's 13 + 7 = 20 friends total.

Each friend gets two drinks and three snacks, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 things per friend.

They all get drinks and snacks, so that's 20 friends times 5 things each, which is 20 * 5 = 100 things.

Each thing costs $2, so 100 things cost 100 * $2 = $200.

"Hmm, lemme see...

If the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, that means the turtle is 5 times slower. So the turtle crawls 15 feet / 5 = 3 feet per second.

* **Mini Quiches:** 3 quiches * $4.00/quiche = $12.00
* **Blueberry Muffins:** 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

* **Subtotal:** $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

"Okay, so Erin wants ice cream.  She gets one free for every two she buys.  That means she's really only payin' for two scoops at a time.

"Okay, so Ginger eats 4 candies a day, and Amy eats 3. That means Ginger eats 4 x 14 = 56 candies in two weeks. Amy eats 3 x 14 = 42 candies in two weeks.

So Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 candies left. Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 candies left.

That means Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more candies than Ginger.

"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches. That's a whole lotta shoe!  

First, we gotta figure out how many inches that is. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 times 12, which is 96 inches.  

So Topher's shoe is 96 inches plus 4 inches, which is 100 inches long.

Now, let's say Bobby's shoe is ""x"" inches long.

The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe. So we can write that as an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Let's solve for x:

1. Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x
2. Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

Let's see... she breaks a quarter of the student cars, so that's 64 / 4 = 16 student cars.

Each student car has 4 windows, so that's 16 * 4 = 64 windows.

Now for the teachers' cars. She breaks 3/4ths of them, so that's 32 * (3/4) = 24 teacher cars.

Each teacher car has 2 windows, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 windows.

In total, she breaks 64 + 48 = 112 windows.

"Okay, so Candy has a bunch of blue thread and some other colors.  We gotta figure out what part of all her thread is blue.

Let's see... 15 light blue plus 45 dark blue is 60 blue spools.

That's a lot of blue!

Now we gotta see what part 60 is out of all her spools.  

She has 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools in total.

So, 60 blue spools out of 150 total spools... hmm...

I dunno percentages real good, but I know 60 is less than half of 150.

So it's gotta be less than 50%.

40% 



"
"Okay, so lots of folks showed up to vote.  

First, half of them voted by midday, that's 5000 / 2 = 2500 people.

That means 5000 - 2500 = 2500 people were left.

Then, two-thirds of those left voted by 4 o'clock, so that's 2500 x (2/3) = 1666.66 people.

Since we can't have parts of people, let's say 1666 people voted.

That leaves 2500 - 1666 = 834 people who hadn't voted.


834 

"
"Okay, so Parker chews 4 gums a day, and he needs them for 30 days. That's 4 times 30, which is 120 gums.

Each pack has 15 gums, so we gotta see how many times 15 goes into 120.

120 divided by 15 is 8.


8 

"
"Okay, so we got kids wantin' smores and grownups wantin' smores too.

Let's see... 9 kids times 2 smores each is 18 smores for the kids.

And the grownups want 6 smores.

That's a total of 18 plus 6, which is 24 smores.

Each box makes enough for 8 smores times 3 sleeves, so that's 24 smores per box.

We need 24 smores and each box makes 24 smores, so we need 1 box.


1 

"
"Okay, so Dora is 15. Her daddy is twice her age plus eight more, so that's 15 times 2 plus 8, which is 38. Her mommy is four years younger than daddy, so she's 38 minus 4, which is 34.

Now we add them all up: 15 plus 38 plus 34 equals 87.


87 

"
"Greg has 3 siblings, so there are 4 people in total.

20 dollars split by 4 people is 5 dollars each.

5 

"
"Okay, so Cindy's math and science books are 2 pounds each, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

Her history book is twice her English book, which is 3 pounds, so her history book is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.

Now let's add up all the books: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds


17 

"
"Okay, so A got 20 votes. B got 50% more than that, so that's like half of 20, which is 10, plus 20, so B got 30 votes.

That means A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes together.

If there were 100 voters, then C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"
"Boris has lotsa apples, way more than Beck. Beck needs more apples. Boris gives some to Beck, that's nice of him.

"
"Okay, so Peter uses a lotta water for those big cubes, 3 cubes times 4 ounces each is 12 ounces. Then he uses 7 medium cubes times 2 ounces each, that's 14 ounces. And the little cubes use 8 cubes times half an ounce, so that's 4 ounces.

Let's add all that up: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces used.

Now we take the water he started with and take away what he used: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"
"Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 16 books.

Clara has 10 more books than Alice.

"
"Okay, so a half-gallon jar costs $3 cuz a gallon is $5 and that's $2 more.

Ten gallon jars cost 10 times $5, so that's $50.

Sixteen half-gallon jars cost 16 times $3, so that's $48.

Now we add those together: $50 + $48 = $98


98 

"
"Okay, so...

* 10 like to bake.
* 5 like basketball.
* Music lovers are double the basketball players, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 music lovers.

That's 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 students who like baking, basketball, or music.

That leaves 50 - 25 = 25 students who like video games.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy scared away some birds, then more came.  Let's see...

He scared away 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

That means 12 - 4 = 8 birds were left.

Then 20 more came, so 8 + 20 = 28 birds.


28 

"
"Okay, so there's 80 kids total, and they're split into two groups, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 kids in each class.

If 40% are girls, then 100% - 40% = 60% are boys.

So, 40 kids times 60% is... hmm...  60% of 40 is like 60 out of every 100, so that's (60/100) * 40 = 24 boys.



24 

"
"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Start:** Mara begins with 2 slices.
* **Add more:** She adds 3 slices, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
* **Triple it:** She triples the amount, giving her 5 x 3 = 15 slices.
* **Eat some:** She eats 2 slices, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
* **Friend steals:** Her friend takes 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

"
"Let's see... 8 dogs plus 5 cats plus 3 birdies plus 12 horsies... that's a lotta animals!

That's 28 animals in total.  And there are 7 days in a week.

"
"Okay, so Mark spent 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400

He made $4000 + $1000 = $5000 from the good cards.

The other cards are worth 30 cards * $50/card = $1500

So he made a total of $5000 + $1500 = $6500

His profit is $6500 - $5400 = $1100


$1100 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

First park: 2 grownups times $26 is $52. Then 2 kids times $12 is $24.  So that's $52 plus $24, which is $76 for the first park.

Second park: 2 grownups times $14 is $28. Then 2 kids times $10 is $20. So that's $28 plus $20, which is $48 for the second park.

Now, to see how much they save, we gotta subtract the cheaper park from the more expensive one: $76 minus $48 is $28.


$28 

"
"Okay, so he saves $.10 on each tomato.

That's 500 tomatoes times $.10, which is $50 a day.

In a week, that's $50 a day times 7 days, so $350.


350 

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles.

Cal has twice as many as Sean, so Cal has 56 x 2 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many as Sean, so Carl has 56 x 4 = 224 marbles.

Altogether, Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

336 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

We need 12 groups but only have 6.

That means we need more groups.

12 - 6 = 6

"
"Okay, so Candy rents chairs on weekdays and weekends.

Let's see... weekdays are like Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days.

She rents 60 chairs each weekday, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 chairs.

Weekends are Saturday and Sunday, so that's 2 days.

She rents 100 chairs each weekend day, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 chairs.

So, in a whole week, she rents 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs.

Now, a month has 4 weeks, so in a month she rents 500 times 4, which is 2000 chairs.

Two months is double that, so she rents 2000 times 2, which is 4000 chairs.

"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Arnold's first theft:** Arnold took half of Gunther's 48 bananas, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
* **Bananas left after the first theft:** Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
* **After Gunther adds more:** Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
* **Arnold's second theft:** Arnold took 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
* **Gunther's final addition:** Gunther added 6 more bananas, giving him a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So they split the $100 bill 5 ways, right? That's Jenna plus her 4 roommates.

So each person pays $20 a month.

"
"Okay, so Jeff had lots of glasses and plates. Some broke, that's bad.

* Glasses: 8 dozen is like 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses.  He lost 10, so he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left.

* Plates: 4 dozen plates is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates. He lost 6, so he has 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"
"Okay, so Lorraine has lots of stickers, and she's gonna trade 'em for buttons.

First, she trades most of her small stickers for big buttons. That's 90% of 30, which is... hmm... 27 small stickers.

Each small sticker gets her one small button, so that's 27 buttons.

She also trades half of her big stickers for big buttons. Half of 40 is 20 big stickers.

Each big sticker is worth a big button, so that's another 20 big buttons.

Now she has some big stickers left. She trades those for small buttons. She had 40 big stickers and traded 20, so she has 20 left.

Each big sticker is worth three small buttons, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 small buttons.

So, she has 27 small buttons + 20 big buttons + 60 small buttons...

Let's see... 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

* **Small shirts:** Twice as many students need small as extra-small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.
* **Medium shirts:** Four less than the number of small shirts need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.
* **Large shirts:** Half as many students need large as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.
* **Extra-large shirts:** Six more students need extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

* **Total shirts:**  11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

"Hmm, lemme see... 5% off of 140... that's like takin' a little bit off the top.

"
"Okay, so 20 people think horse #2 will win.

That leaves 50 - 20 = 30 people.

Then 60% of those 30 people like horse #7, so that's 30 * 0.60 = 18 people.

That means 30 - 18 = 12 people think horse #12 will win.

"Hmm, lemme see...

If 6 Pomeranian girls is one third, that means there are 6 x 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.

"
"Okay, so the second house needs twice as much as the first.  That means the first house needs half of 250, which is 125.

The third house needs double the first, so it needs 125 x 2 = 250 cases.

"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* Leila's cucumbers cost 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

"Okay, so Sam needs lots of oranges to make juice!

He needs 5 big bags of oranges for just 1 jug of juice.  Each bag costs $3, so that's like $3 x 5 = $15 for one jug.

Now he wants to make 4 jugs, so that's like $15 x 4 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Ezra read a lot of books!  Twice as many as Ahmed... hmm...

Let's see, Ezra read 300 and wants to read 150 more, so that's 300 + 150 = 450 books for Ezra.

Now we gotta figure out how many Ahmed read. Ezra read twice as many, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Altogether, they read 450 + 150 = 600 books!


600 

"
"Okay, so Tanya makes $15 each hour.

On Monday she taught 4 classes for 5 hours, so that's 4 times 5, which is 20 hours.

She makes 20 times $15, which is $300.

On Wednesday she taught 2 classes for 2 hours, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 hours.

She makes 4 times $15, which is $60.

She taught more than 3 classes on Monday, so she gets an extra $5.

So on Monday she made $300 plus $5, which is $305.

In total she made $305 plus $60, which is $365.



365 

"
"Okay, so they sold 5 of each vanilla, and there's 4 vanilla scents, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 vanilla scents sold.

Then they sold 2 of each fruity scent, and there's 8 fruity scents, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16 fruity scents sold.

To find out how many more vanilla scents sold, we gotta subtract the fruity scents sold from the vanilla scents sold. So 20 minus 16 is...

"Hmm, lemme see...

Bennet makes 20 eggs plants times $3 each, that's 60 dollars.

He needs to make 135 dollars total, so he needs 135 - 60 = 75 dollars more.

He has 25 ears of corn, so each ear needs to be 75 dollars / 25 ears = $3 per ear.

"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 + 5 = 12 hours total.

She reads for 3 hours, so that leaves 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

Video games take up 1/3 of the rest, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

That means she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage, we do (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

"Anthony gave Brandon 50 / 2 = 25 pencils.

That left him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

"
"Okay, so Jack drives to the museum and back, which is 150 miles each way, so that's 300 miles total.

He drives 75 miles per hour, so the drive takes 4 hours (300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours).

He also spends 6 hours at the museum.

So, in total, he's gone for 10 hours (4 hours driving + 6 hours at the museum).

"Okay, so Henry's got lots of toys to put together.

He needs 4 wheels for each car, and he's got 57 cars, so that's 4 * 57 = 228 wheels.

Then he needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he's got 73 motorcycles, so that's 2 * 73 = 146 wheels.

In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

"Okay, so Mike has a lot of movies!

Let's see... a third of his movies are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

Those series movies are cheaper, only $6 each, so that's 200 * $6 = $1200.

That leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies left.

40% of those are old movies, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 old movies.

Those cost $5 each, so that's 160 * $5 = $800.

That means there are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies left.

Those cost $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now we add up all the costs: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400


$4400

"Okay, so Winston got lots of fruit!

Peaches cost $2 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 2 x 6 = $12.

Plums are $1 a pound and he got 8 pounds, so that's 1 x 8 = $8.

Apricots are $3 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 3 x 6 = $18.

Now we add up all the fruit: $12 + $8 + $18 = $38


$38 

"
"Okay, so they drove for a while, then hiked for a bit.  

Let's see... they drove for 6 hours total minus the 1.5 hours hiking, so that's 4.5 hours driving.

They drove 50 miles per hour, so in 4.5 hours they went 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Hiking is tricky. Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour.

And they hiked 5 miles per hour slower than that, so 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so that's 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hmm, lemme see...

They spent 64 dollars on all the pizzas, and two of them cost 30 dollars. So that leaves 64 - 30 = 34 dollars for the other two pizzas.

"Hmm, lemme see...

They ride three times a day for five days, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 times.

Then they ride twice as much on two days, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 times each day.

So those two days are 6 times 2, which is 12 times.

Altogether, they ride 15 plus 12 times, which is 27 times.

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles a day.

He drives 5 days a week, so that's 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles a week.

His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons a week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 a week on gas.


15 

"
"Okay, so Carrie got ten twenties, that's like ten times twenty dollars, which is two hundred dollars.

And she got one hundred and forty quarters, which is like, a lot of quarters!  Each quarter is twenty-five cents, so that's one hundred and forty times twenty-five cents... hmm, that's thirty-five dollars.

She spent three-fifths of the twenties, so that's three out of five twenties, which is six twenties. Six times twenty dollars is one hundred and twenty dollars.

So she spent one hundred and twenty dollars from the twenties and thirty-five dollars from the quarters.

That's one hundred and fifty-five dollars in total.

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold some smart TVs, some old-fashioned TVs, and some fancy OLED TVs.  We know he sold 40 TVs in total.

Let's see... one-fourth is like cutting the TVs into four equal groups, and taking one of them. That's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 smart TVs.

Then one-eighth is like cutting the TVs into eight equal groups and taking one. That's 40 divided by 8, which is 5 analog TVs.

So, to find out how many OLED TVs he sold, we take the total number of TVs and subtract the smart TVs and the analog TVs: 40 - 10 - 5 = 25

"
"Okay, so John needs $300 and the school is payin' half, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.

"Okay, so it's warm during the day, but gets way colder at night.  

Gotta keep those pipes from freezin'!

Let's see... it's 33 degrees colder at night, so that means it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

Uh oh, that's below 32!  

He needs to warm it up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log adds 5 degrees, so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs.


4 

"
"Okay, so there were 90 people and they made groups of 9. That means there were 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Then 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, so that's 10 * (3/5) = 6 groups.

Each of those groups brought back 2 seashells per person, and there are 9 people in each group, so that's 2 * 9 = 18 seashells per group.

So, 6 groups * 18 seashells/group = 108 seashells.


108 

"
"Okay, so there's 172 people on the train. Then 47 get off, so that's 172 - 47 = 125.

Now, in a month with 30 days, he makes $2.50 times 30 days, which is $75.

"Jamie makes $20 times 8 hours, that's $160.

She worked 3 extra hours.

Those extra hours are paid at $20 times 1.5, which is $30 per hour.

In total, she made $160 plus $90, which is $250.

250

"
"Okay, so the jeans are cheaper now, that's good!

Let's see... 25% off of 40 dollars... hmm...  

That means the jeans cost 40 - (25/100 * 40) dollars.

That's 40 - 10 dollars, so the jeans cost 30 dollars.

If Mike pays with a 50 dollar bill, he'll get 50 - 30 dollars back.

So the answer is: 20 

"
"Okay, so they start with 200 folks, and add 20 more each month.

That's 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 new folks after three months.

So now they got 200 + 60 = 260 workers.

"Okay, so Billy starts at $10 an hour, then gets a raise to $10.50, then another raise to $11.50.  Sally starts at $10.50.

They both work 20 hours.

Billy makes $11.50 x 20 = $230

Sally makes $10.50 x 20 = $210

Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"Okay, so bread is $2 each and I need 3 of them. That's 2 times 3 which is 6 dollars.

Bagels are $1 each and I need 2. That's 1 times 2 which is 2 dollars.

Now I gotta see how much more the bread is. So I take the bread price, 6 dollars, and take away the bagel price, 2 dollars.

6 - 2 = 4

"Okay, so there's lots of kids and teachers plantin' trees.

Let's see... 40 classes times 25 kids is a whole lotta kids... that's 1000 kids!

And each kid plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees already.

Then there's 3 teachers per class, so that's 40 classes times 3 teachers, which is 120 teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 120 teachers times 2 trees each, makin' 240 trees.

Now we gotta add the kids' trees and the teachers' trees... 1000 plus 240 is... 1240 trees!

"Okay, so Kris plays for 30 minutes a day for 14 days, that's 30 * 14 = 420 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 420 / 60 = 7 hours.

Then she plays for 2 hours a day for 7 days, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

In total, she plays 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 more hours.

"Okay, so the diamond and gold cost 600 + 300 = 900 bucks.

The premium is 30% of 900, which is (30/100) * 900 = 270 bucks.

* Third grade: 340 passed outta 500 kids.
* Fourth grade: 40 passed outta 100 kids.
* Fifth grade: Twice as many passed as fourth grade, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80 kids.

Now we gotta add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Then we add up all the kids: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, we divide the number who passed by the total number of kids: 460 divided by 1000...

460 / 1000 = 0.46

"Okay, so Milo needs lots of chips for his shiny picture.

He needs 12 chips for every inch, and his picture is 3 inches tall. That's 12 times 3, which is 36 chips just for the height.

He has two bags, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has 72 times 2, which is 144 chips total.

Now, he can make a picture 144 chips long divided by 12 chips per inch, which is 12 inches long.

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

Them four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 times 1.5, which is 6 quarts.

Then them 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 times 2, which is 32 quarts.

Altogether, they drank 6 plus 32, which is 38 quarts.

Since there's 10 quarts left, they musta started with 38 plus 10, which is 48 quarts.

Now, there's 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 quarts is 48 divided by 4, which is 12 gallons.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate petals from the first set of flowers:** 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
* **Step 2: Calculate petals from the second set of flowers:** 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* **Step 3: Calculate petals from the third set of flowers:** 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* **Step 4: Calculate petals from the fourth set of flowers:** 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals
* **Step 5: Calculate the total petals before dropping any:** 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

"Okay, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their s'mores.

Then they lost 3 more, so that's 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows gone.

Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 s'mores.

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who are bad play for half as long, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter. His good friend plays for 1.5 times as long, so he plays for 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Let's figure out how many quarters each person needs:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
* Bad friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
* Good friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now let's add up the total quarters:

* Jack: 12 quarters
* Bad friends: 24 quarters each * 2 friends = 48 quarters
* Good friend: 8 quarters
* Total: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is:

* 68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00

"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is (20/100) * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives his mom twice the number he sold, so he gives her 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

In total, he gets rid of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.

The second day she walked half that time, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Then she got 6 packs of dog food with 6 tins each, so that's 6 times 6 tins, which is... 36 tins!

Now we gotta see how many more cat tins she got than dog tins.  That's 88 minus 36... which is 52!

"
"Hmm, lotsa numbers!  Let's see...

* PJ has some cards, let's call it ""x"".
* Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards, so that's 3 * x.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so that's 3 * x + 12.

All together they have 341 cards, so:

x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341

Let's add up the x's:

7x + 12 = 341

Now take away 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.

Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

* **Total for Weeks 1-3:** Boris makes a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Let's see... 18 videos times 4 minutes each is 72 minutes on videos.

Writing songs takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Makeup is 15 minutes a day, so that's 15 times 6 days, which is 90 minutes.

So that's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes a week.

Now, there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's 282 times 4, which is... 1128 minutes.

She has 2 chandeliers and they only do 1, so that's 1 extra chandelier.

And she has 20 pictures and they only do 10, so that's 10 extra pictures.

"Hmm, kangaroos are fast, turtles are slow...

Let's see... if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, right? So 1 kangaroo takes 54 hours.

Now, turtles are half as fast, so they'd take twice as long. That means one turtle takes 108 hours.

With four turtles, they'd be slower, so it'll take them 4 times longer than one turtle.

So, 108 hours times 4 is... 432 hours.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

* Sofie has more books than Anne, and Anne has less than Fawn. So Fawn must have the most books.

* If we take away Sofie's extra books, maybe we can figure out how many Anne has.

* Then we can add Anne's books to Fawn's to see how many they have together.

*  That should help us know how many Fawn has!

"Okay, so Daisy got some potatoes, then some sweet potatoes that were twice as heavy, and then carrots that were lighter than the sweet potatoes.

Let's see... potatoes are 5 pounds. Sweet potatoes are 5 times 2, which is 10 pounds. Carrots are 10 minus 3, which is 7 pounds.

"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids times 4 cups each, that's 120 cups.  

One box makes 10 cups, so he needs 120 cups divided by 10 cups per box, which is 12 boxes.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 times $1.25.

12 * $1.25 = $15.00


$15.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 5 phones times $700 each... that's a lotta money!

So, 5 times 700 is 3500.

That means the seller paid 4000 and the phones cost 3500...

So the change is 4000 minus 3500...

4000 - 3500 = 500


500 

"
"Okay, so Madeline pays 60% of the $400, which is a lot. That leaves 40% for Keenan.

Let's see... 40% of $400 is... hmm...  

*counts on fingers*

That's $160 for Keenan for the whole month.

Now, there are four weeks in a month, so we gotta split that $160 by 4.

*counts on fingers again*

That's $40 per week for Keenan.

"
"Okay, so Tobias ate a bunch of pizza.

First day he ate 60 pieces times 2/5, which is like cutting the pizza into 5 slices and taking 2. That's 24 pieces!

Second day he ate 10 pieces.

Third day is tricky.  First gotta figure out how many pieces were left after the first two days. That's 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

Then he ate 7/13 of those, so 26 times 7/13... hmm, that's about 14 pieces.

So in total, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.


48 

"
"Okay, so...

Soda costs $3 a bottle cuz 21 divided by 7 is 3.

Water costs $2 a bottle cuz 8 divided by 4 is 2.

Three sodas cost 9 bucks cuz 3 times 3 is 9.

Two waters cost 4 bucks cuz 2 times 2 is 4.

So, 9 plus 4 is 13.

"
"Okay, so David has some money and wants to buy a bunch of bolts.  Each bolt is real cheap, only a few cents.  Let's see...

* He needs 16 bolts and each one costs 3 cents, so that's 16 times 3... which is 48 cents.

* Now we gotta take that 48 cents away from his $12.48.

*  Hmm, that's like taking away 48 pennies from 1248 pennies...

*  That leaves him with... 12 dollars even!


12 

"
"Hmm, so Ella makes money for walkin' dogs. She gets 33 dollars for 3 hours.  That's like... 11 dollars each hour, right?

So if she walks for 12 hours, she'd make 11 times 12...

132 

"
"Paul got more marbles, then he lost some.  

Let's see... 52 plus 28 is 80 marbles.

Then he lost some... a quarter of 80 is 20 marbles.

So he has 80 minus 20 marbles left.

60 

"
"Okay, so Amy's good at history!

Let's see... she gets 8 outta 10 on the multiple choice, that's 8 points.

Then she gets 18 outta 20 on the true/false, so that's another 18 points.

On the long answer, she gets 3 outta 5 right, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 points.

Now we add it all up: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000. He sells each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

Let's see... 3/5 of 300 chickens is 180 chickens.

He needs to make $2000 from selling 180 chickens at $50 each.

Hmm... 180 times $50 is $9000.

That means he made $9000 from selling the chickens.

To figure out how much he paid for them, we gotta subtract his profit from the total he made.

$9000 - $2000 = $7000


$7000 

"
"Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses together.

They each sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

"Okay, so Iris spent way less on her nails than her hair.

Her manicure cost $400 / 4 = $100.

Her pedicure cost $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find the total, we add up all the prices: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

"
"Okay, so Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 dollars.

Then she buys a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter, and it's also 20 meters long, so that's 20 times 1.50, which is 30 dollars.

She started with 40 dollars and spent 30 dollars, so she has 40 minus 30 dollars left.

10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

If she's gonna be 18 in 10 years, that means she's 8 now.

Thrice her age is 8 times 3, which is 24.

So we gotta figure out how many years it'll take for her to go from 8 to 24...

That's 16 years!


16 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, so one pack costs $2.

Chicken costs twice as much as bacon, so each pack is $4.

Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so that's $4 x 6 = $24.

Strawberries are $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 x 3 = $12.

Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each.

She has 7 packs of apples, so that's $2 x 7 = $14.

In total, her groceries cost $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If her budget is $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.


$5 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

The concert is twice as long as usual, plus an extra 15 minutes.

So, take away the extra 15 minutes first: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is twice the length of a normal concert.

So, divide that by 2: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

Let's see... 125 plus 125 is 250. And then Friday is double Tuesday, so that's another 250.

So all together, it's 250 plus 250.

250 + 250 = 500

"Hmm, lemme see... 

He has 50 microphones, and 20% can't fit. That means 80% can fit, right?

So, 80% of 50 is...

That's 40 microphones that can fit.

And since they go in pairs, that's 40 divided by 2...

*counts again*

20 pairs!

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Six birds in the bushes...

Two-thirds of six is like cutting the six birds into three groups and taking two of them... so that's four birds flying.

Three groups of eight birds eating is like 8 plus 8 plus 8, which is 24 birds.

Now we gotta add 'em all up: six plus four plus 24...

"Okay, so Joelle has some flowers.  Orchids have less petals than daisies.  

Let's see... 4 daisies times 10 petals is 40 petals.  And 5 orchids times 5 petals is 25 petals.

40 take away 25 is 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has a lotta plants!

First, we gotta figure out how many are inside plants. One-fourth of 100 is like splittin' it into four equal groups, so that's 100 / 4 = 25 inside plants.

That leaves 100 - 25 = 75 plants left.

Now, two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 75 * (2/3) = 50 outside plants.

That means there's 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To get the percentage, we gotta divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. So, (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"
"Hmm, let's see...

A whatchamacallit goes super fast, 121 meters per second. And it goes eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So the thingamabob is slower, right?

The whirligig is five times faster than the thingamabob...

*scratches head*

So if the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second and that's eleven times faster than the thingamabob, then the thingamabob is... 121 divided by 11... which is 11 meters per second.

And the whirligig is five times faster than that... so 11 times 5 is... 55!


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen's yogurt costs $3 because it's half the price of the salad.

That means the carrots and salad cost $8 together ($11 total - $3 yogurt).

So the two carrots cost $2 ($8 - $6 salad).

That means one carrot costs $1 ($2 / 2 carrots).

"Okay, so Mark works a lot! He makes more money now, that's good.

Let's see... he makes $12 an hour now, right?  'Cause they gave him $2 more.

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Martin weighs 55 kg, and Carl is 16 kg heavier, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John makes $25 for every hour he rents his car. He rents it for 3 hours each time, so that's 25 x 3 = $75 each time.

He rents it out 10 times a month, so he makes $75 x 10 = $750 a month.

His car payment is $500, so he makes $750 - $500 = $250 profit.

"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for 4 big bowls or 8 little bowls.

He and his wife are big bowls, so that's 2 bowls gone.

His kids are little bowls, so that's 2 more bowls gone.

Each kid gets 1 bowl, so they can have 4 bowls / 2 kids = 2 bowls each.

"Okay, so Jo needs more material for the small masks 'cause she makes less of them with the same amount as the big ones.  

Let's see... 20 small masks is like 20 / 4 = 5 sets of the small masks.

That means she needs 5 * 2 = 10 yards for the small masks.

For the big masks, she needs 8 / 3 = 2.66 sets... round that up to 3 sets 'cause you can't have part of a set.

So that's 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards for the big masks.

Now add them together: 10 + 6.75 = 16.75 yards

* **Total spent:** They spent a total of $11.00 (cake) + $3.00 (balloons) + $14.00 (ice cream) = $28.00
* **Allowance each:** Since they combined their allowance, they each got $28.00 / 2 = $14.00

"Hmm, lemme see...

They sold 30 students times 10 lollipops each, so that's 300 lollipops.

Each lollipop cost them 50 cents, so 300 lollipops cost 300 times 50 cents, which is 150 dollars.

They sold them for 80 cents each, so 300 lollipops times 80 cents is 240 dollars.

So they made 240 dollars minus 150 dollars, which is 90 dollars.

He spent $8 on 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.

He spent $2 on 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

In total, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That leaves him with $150 - $130 = $20.

He needs $10 for a ticket tonight, plus $8 for popcorn and $2 for candy, for a total of $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

That means he can see 1 more movie tonight.

"
"Okay, so Maria gave 4 friends 2 balloons each, that's 4 times 2 which is 8 balloons.

Then she had 1 balloon, so that's 8 plus 1, which is 9 balloons.

Then her mom gave everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people times 3 balloons, which is 15 balloons.

So 9 plus 15 is 24 balloons.


24 

"
"Okay, so they got 10 people times 5 boxes is 50 boxes.

Then they add the 10 they already had, so that's 60 boxes.

Each table holds 2 boxes, so they need 60 boxes divided by 2 boxes per table, which is 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 minus 15, which is 15 more tables.

WidgetMaster makes 45 widgets an hour times 24 hours, that's 1080 widgets a day.

Times that by 30 days, that's 32,400 widgets a month.

Widgeteer makes 43,200 - 32,400 = 10,800 more widgets.

10,800 widgets times $6 each is... $64,800

"Okay, so Cameron stays for 17 hours.

He'd pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.

That leaves 5 extra hours.

5 hours times 70 pesos per hour is 350 pesos.

Let's see... twice the goats amount is 5 times 2 which is 10. Then we take away 3, so sheep eat 7 pounds.

Now, 15 goats times 5 pounds each is 75 pounds.

And 12 sheep times 7 pounds each is 84 pounds.

Altogether, that's 75 plus 84 pounds.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

John makes 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he made 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He wants to save 100 dollars, leaving him with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

The pencils cost 10 dollars each, and he buys 5, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 dollars spent on pencils.

He has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"Okay, so the teacher has lots of juice, enough for everyone!

She has 9 coupons times 100 bottles each, that's a whole lotta juice!

Then she gives each of the 29 kids 2 bottles, so that's... hmm... lots of bottles.

Let me see... 

...

9 times 100 is 900 bottles.

29 kids times 2 bottles each is 58 bottles.

900 minus 58 is... 842!


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come over. Then she charges $35 for each hour, and it took her 2 hours and a bit more.  She also used $60 in parts.

Let's see... 2 hours times $35 is $70.  

So that's $40 + $70 + $60...

$170


170
"
"Okay, so James buys some CDs, gets a deal on them, then sells some.  Let's see...

He buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150.

But he gets 40% off, so we gotta figure out what 40% of 150 is.  That's like 40 out of every 100, so it's 60 bucks off.

So the CDs cost him 150 minus 60, which is 90 bucks.

Then he sells 5 of them for 40 bucks total.

So he spent 90 and made 40 back, so he's out... 90 minus 40.

50



"
"Okay, so she got them yams, them sweet potatoes, and them carrots.

Let's see... 6 yams times $1.50... that's $9.

Then 10 sweet potatoes times $2... that's $20.

And 4 carrots times $1.25... that's $5.

Now we add it all up: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34


34 

"
"Okay, so James swims 20 miles times 60% which is 12 miles.

That takes him 12 miles divided by 2 miles per hour which is 6 hours.

He rests for half that time, so 6 hours divided by 2 is 3 hours.

He has 8 miles left to swim, and now he's going 1 mile per hour.

So that takes him 8 miles divided by 1 mile per hour which is 8 hours.

In total, it took him 6 hours plus 3 hours plus 8 hours.


17 

"
"Okay, so Sam had 70 loaves.

Seven times that is 7 times 70, which is 490.

The bakery has 40 less than that, so we gotta subtract 40 from 490.

490 minus 40 is 450.


450 

"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers, loses 7, so that's 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

Then she gets 5 more, so 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.


13 

"
"Okay, so Cayley sells some newspapers and gets money for each one he sells.

New York Times cost $5 and he gets 10% of that, so he makes $0.50 for each one.

Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets 8%, so he makes $1.20 for each one.

He sells 6 New York Times, so that's 6 times $0.50, which is $3.

He sells 10 Wall Street Journals, so that's 10 times $1.20, which is $12.

In total, he makes $3 + $12, which is $15.



15 

"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so Marcus is 21.  That means Leo is twice as old as Marcus, so Leo is 42.


42 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Bahati scored the most, so let's say he got 20 points.

Azibo got 20 less than Bahati, so that's 20 - 20 = 0 points.

Dinar got 10 less than Bahati, so that's 20 - 10 = 10 points.

Now, 20 + 0 + 10 = 30 points.

That's not 45 points... lemme try again.

If Bahati got 25 points, then Azibo got 25 - 20 = 5 points.

Dinar got 25 - 10 = 15 points.

That's 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 points!

So Azibo scored 5 points.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

So it's 100 pages per inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick...

That's like... 100 times 1.5...

"
"Okay, so Vince staples real fast, like 30 papers in just 15 minutes.  That's a lot of staplin'!

He starts at 8 in the mornin' and goes till 11 at night. That's a long time, like 15 hours!

Hmm, gotta figure out how many 15 minute chunks are in 15 hours...

*scratches head*

...

15 hours times 4 'cause there's 4 fifteen minute chunks in an hour... that's 60 chunks!

So he staples 30 papers per chunk, and he did 60 chunks...

30 times 60...

...

1800

"
"Okay, so Kim usually sleeps from 10pm to 6am. That's like 8 hours.

But she woke up early to pee, so she slept less than 8 hours.

And she was sleepwalking for a bit, so that's not real sleep either.

Let's see... 6am is when she usually wakes up, but she woke up 5 minutes early, so that's 5:55am.

From 10pm to 5:55am is a long time... lemme count...

...

Okay, I think she slept for 475 minutes that day.

"Okay, so Jonathan has lots of cups, way more than spoons. He gives some spoons away, so he has less stuff now.

"
"Okay, so the hospital has a lotta beds, a thousand! And only a fifth of them are full, so that's like, 200 beds, right?

Then they get 50 more people every day. That's a lot of sick folks!

Two weeks is like 14 days, so that's 14 times 50, which is 700 more people.

So now there's 200 plus 700, that's 900 people in the hospital.

That leaves 100 beds empty.

100 



"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.

Seven are work emails, so that leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails left.

Two-thirds of those are to family, so that's (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family.

That means 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left for her boyfriend.



3 

"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.


45 

"
"Hmm, Courtney said 48 people were there, but Kelly said she was wrong by 20%.  That means Courtney counted 20% too many people.

Let's see... 20% of 48... that's like a fifth of 48... which is... 9.6.

So Courtney counted 9.6 too many people.

If we take 9.6 away from 48, we get... 38.4.

But you can't have part of a person, so there must have been 38 people at the concert.


38 

"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Jeffrey:** Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
* **Jordan:** Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.
* **Total:** Together they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.


7 

"
"Okay, so they dug a bunch of holes, then filled some in, then found treasure.  

Let's see... ten plus thirteen plus eight is thirty-one holes.

They filled in two, so that's twenty-nine holes.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the first day, so that's ten times four, which is forty holes.

They needed to dig eleven more holes to get to forty.


11 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

If Amora and Lainey got 70 each, that's 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.

Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Altogether, they had 140 + 85 = 225 corn chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.

The tickets cost 50% more, so that's like half of the supply cost again.

Half of $400 is $200.

So the tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600.


$600

"Okay, so let's try to figure this out.

Adelwolfe has some Pokemon, right? And Stan has less than four times what Adelwolfe has.  Alex has a few more than Stan.

I give up. 



"
"Okay, so the show has 20 minute episodes, and there's half as many episodes as minutes in an episode... so that's 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Then you multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200

200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for a while, then north, then south again.  We gotta figure out how far she flew in total.

* First, she flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles.
* Then she flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 2 * 18 = 36 miles.
* Finally, she flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

Now, to find the total distance, we gotta add up the south distances and subtract the north distance: 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.



374 

"
"Okay, so Greta had 12 brownies from her own batch. Then she got 6 more from work (half a dozen). Her friends brought 48 brownies (4 dozen). That's 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

They ate 18 brownies (1 and a half dozen).

So she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.


48 

"
"Okay, so Nani is 8. His brother is twice that, so he's 8 times 2 which is 16. Nani's sister is younger than him by 25%, so we gotta figure out what 25% of 8 is.  That's 2! So she's 8 minus 2, which is 6 years old.

Now we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30


30 

"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Synthetic gut:** 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
* **Polyester:** 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
* **Hybrid:** 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

**Total time:** 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, that's $600 x 2 = $1200.

Then he buys two more phones at half price, so that's $600 / 2 = $300 per phone.

Those two phones cost $300 x 2 = $600.

All together, he spent $1200 + $600 = $1800.


1800 

"
"Okay, so Zeke's team has more players.  Carlton's team has 13, and Zeke's has 7 more than that... so Zeke's team has 20 players (13 + 7 = 20).

Now we gotta add them together. 13 + 20 = 33


33 

"
"Okay, so he's got a fence that's like a big square, right?  

He needs two sticks for every foot all the way around.

Gotta add up all the sides first. 15 feet plus 10 feet, that's 25 feet. Then the other side is 10 feet plus 15 feet, that's another 25 feet.

So it's 25 feet plus 25 feet, which is 50 feet all the way around.

Now, he needs two sticks for every foot, so 50 times 2 is...

100 



"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington starts with 12 boxes.

She gives away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She keeps 8 / 4 = 2 boxes.

She sells 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

She sells 6 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 120 oranges.

"Okay, lemme see...

Half the number of states in the USA... that's like splittin' 'em in two.  

Then India has 4 more than that... so it's like addin' a few more.

*counts on fingers*

50 states in the USA, half is 25.

Add 4 more for India, that's 29.

Now we gotta add the USA states and India states together... 25 + 29...

"Okay, so Tyler needs to know how much all the books cost together.

Then we gotta see how much more money he needs.

Then we can figure out how many hours he needs to work to get that extra money.

Let's add up the book prices: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now let's see how much more money he needs: $39 - $14 = $25

He needs to earn $25 more.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the money he needs by how much he earns per hour: $25 / $5 = 5

"Okay, lemme see...

So Sunny sold less apple pie on Saturday than Sunday, right?

* Saturday: 10 gingerbread, some apple pie
* Sunday: More gingerbread, 15 apple pie

Gingerbread costs 6 bucks, apple pie costs 15 bucks...

Hmm, this is tricky.  I'm not good with numbers.

...

I dunno, maybe someone who's better at math can figure it out. 



"
"Okay, so she uses 1 ounce per hour and she's outside 4 hours a day, so that's 1 times 4 equals 4 ounces a day.

She's on vacation for 8 days, so that's 4 times 8 equals 32 ounces total.

Each bottle has 8 ounces, so she'll need 32 divided by 8 equals 4 bottles.


4 

"
"Okay, so the red car is cheaper, right?  

That means the red car costs less than $100.

If the red car is 40% cheaper, it's like taking 40 out of every 100 dollars.

So, the red car costs 60 dollars (100 - 40 = 60).

Now, to find the total cost, we add the price of the blue car and the red car: 100 + 60 = 160


160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is gonna be 24 soon. That's 5 years from now.

When he's 24, his dad will be twice his age, so his dad will be 48.

And his brother will be half his age, so his brother will be 12.

Now, to find out how old they are now, we gotta take away those 5 years.

So the dad is 43 now (48 - 5) and the brother is 7 (12 - 5).

If we add those together, 43 + 7 = 50

"Okay, so Joe got 3 pounds on Thursday.

Then on Friday, he got 3 times 4, which is 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he got 12 divided by 2, which is 6 pounds.

So in total, he has 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.

He can make 21 divided by 3 = 7 servings.

"Okay, so 20% of 30 is 6 football players.

That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

25% of 24 is 6 students.

So, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early.

"Charlie's boots are big! Five times bigger than Sophie's size five.  That means Charlie wears a size twenty-five!

"
"Okay, so she needs 3 flowers and 2 vines for each basket, that's 5 things in total.

She has 5 baskets, so that's 5 times 5 things, which is 25 things.

The flowers cost $3 each, so 25 things times $3 is $75.

The vines cost $2.50 each, so 25 things times $2.50 is $62.50.

Now we add the cost of the flowers and vines: $75 + $62.50 = $137.50



$137.50 

"
"Okay, so they got 30 pounds of dirt. Sunflowers take up 3 pounds each, and they're planting 4, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.

Carnations take 1.5 pounds each, and they're planting 10, so that's 1.5 * 10 = 15 pounds.

That's 12 + 15 = 27 pounds used up already.

They started with 30 pounds and used 27, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Each rose needs 1 pound, so they can plant 3 roses.


3 

"
"Okay, so Jessica saves up some money from her paycheck for shoes.  She wants to buy some fancy shoes that cost a lot.

Let's see... 25% of her paycheck is for shoes, so that's 2000 divided by 4, which is 500 dollars.

She can buy one pair of shoes with that, right?

So, in a year, she can buy 500 times 12, which is 6000 dollars worth of shoes.

That means she can buy 6 pairs of shoes.


6 

"
"Okay, so Emily peels 6 shrimp every minute. That means to peel 90 shrimp, it'll take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Now, she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it'll take her 3 times as long, which is 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

So, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes.  That means the whole thing will take 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.


45 

"
"Okay, so it got colder by 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees colder.

Then it got colder by 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees colder.

That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees colder.

But then it warmed up by 2 degrees each hour for 2 hours, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees warmer.

So it ended up 18 - 4 = 14 degrees colder.

"Let's see...

Electric bill is once a month, so that's 12 checks a year.

Gas bill is also once a month, so another 12 checks.

Church gets two checks a month, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 checks.

Pest and lawn is every three months, so that's 4 times a year.

So, 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks!

"
"Okay, so the first plane goes to Greece a lot, and the other plane only goes to Poland.  The Poland plane takes way less trips.  Let's see...

The Poland plane takes half the trips of the first plane, and it takes 44 trips. So the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Greece gets three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips.

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 trips for France and Germany.

France and Germany split those trips evenly, so France gets 22 / 2 = 11 trips.

"Hmm, lemme see...

So there's 2 big slices for the grown-ups and 4 smaller slices for the little ones. That's 6 slices total.

Each grown-up gets 2 slices, so that's 2 out of 6.

Now, 2 out of 6 is the same as 1 out of 3, right?

So each grown-up gets a third of the watermelon.

"
"Okay, so let's see...

He spends 20 minutes per sick person and he has 9 sick people, so that's 20 times 9... which is 180 minutes.

Then he has 10 appointments at 30 minutes each, so that's 10 times 30... which is 300 minutes.

That's a total of 180 plus 300 minutes, which is 480 minutes.

Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 480 minutes is 480 divided by 60... which is 8 hours.

He works 9 hours total and spends 8 hours on patients, so he has 9 minus 8 hours left... which is 1 hour.

"Okay, so she needs 20 minutes to mix, 30 to bake, 2 hours to cool, and 10 to frost. That's a lot of time!

Let's see... 2 hours is 120 minutes.  So all together that's 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

180 minutes is 3 hours.

If she wants it ready at 5:00, she needs to start 3 hours before.

3 hours before 5:00 is 2:00.

"Hmm, let's see... they sold a lotta chocolate!

Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half, so that's 8 boxes all together.

"Okay, so they make $25 each time they have class, and then $1.50 for each of the 10 students.  So that's $15 extra each time.  

So each class makes $25 + $15 = $40.

They have class 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 a week.

A month has about 4 weeks, so they make $120 x 4 = $480 a month.


$480

"Hmm, let's see... Peter has 64 chocolates and they're in 4 boxes, so that's 64 divided by 4... which is 16 chocolates per box.

Martha has 56 chocolates in 7 boxes, so that's 56 divided by 7... which is 8 chocolates per box.

Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolates in each box than Martha.

"Hmm, let's see...

So there's 50 porcupines in total, and 3/5 of them are girls. That's like... 30 girl porcupines.

Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month. That's a lot of babies!

In a year, there are 12 months. So each girl porcupine has 4 babies times 12 months, which is 48 babies!

But there are 30 girl porcupines, so that's 30 times 48 babies, which is... a whole lotta babies!

Let me count... 30 times 48 is 1440 babies!

So, we add the babies to the original porcupines: 1440 plus 50 is... 1490!

"Okay, so they got 9 red sticks.

Then they got 5 more blue sticks than red, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

The yellow sticks are 3 less than the blue sticks, so that's 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add up all the sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

"Hmm, let me see...

Matteo drove 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so he drove 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 450 - 220 = 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"Okay, so half of 3000 is 1500.  That's how many are over 16.

One-fourth of 1500 is 375. That's the boys over 16.

So there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the school is 1500 students under 16.

Half of them are girls, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 girls under 16.

"Okay, so Wanda filled a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

On the first day, they filled a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her first day amount, which is 4500 * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her first day amount, which is 3375 * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On the second day, they filled 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In total, they filled 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank needs 18000 - 12000 = 6000 more gallons.

"
"This is a tricky one!  Let's see...

* It lost 9% each hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.
* Then it lost 7% each hour for 3 hours, so that's 7 * 3 = 21% gone.
* In total, it lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.
* If 28% is left, it means it started with 28% + 66% = 94% charge.

"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 + $15 = $25 an hour.

She needs to save 20% of $10000 which is $10000 * 0.20 = $2000.

She makes $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

So she needs to work $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

"
"Okay, so Jamaar has some money and wants to buy some fruit. Let's see...

He bought 3 peaches at $.50 each, so that's 3 x $.50 = $1.50

He got 4 pears at $.50 each, so that's 4 x $.50 = $2.00

He got 2 kiwis at $1.00 each, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

And he got 5 apples at $.75 each, so that's 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Let's add up how much he spent: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

He started with $10.00 and spent $9.25, so he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $.25 each, so he can buy $0.75 / $.25 = 3 plums.

"
"Okay, so Anne has lotsa candy! She keeps some for herself, and then shares the rest with her friends.  

Let's see... she starts with 15 packs and keeps 2, so that leaves 15 - 2 = 13 packs to share.

Each pack has 60 candies, so she has 13 * 60 = 780 candies to give away.

She has 10 friends, so each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 candies.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So the carrots go up by 5% each year, right?

First year, they go up by 5% of 120, that's like... 6 bucks more, so they'd be 126.

Then the next year, they go up by 5% of 126, which is a little more than 6 bucks... lemme see...

And then the third year, they go up again...

*scratches head*

This is harder than I thought!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 72 pictures split into 8 albums... that's 9 pictures per album.

She got 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, so that's 3 times 9 plus 2 times 9 pictures.

3 times 9 is 27, and 2 times 9 is 18.

27 plus 18 is 45.


45 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

He reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, so that's like... 3 groups of 10 minutes for every 3 pages.

He reads 18 pages, which is like 6 groups of 3 pages.

So, that's 6 groups of 10 minutes...

6 times 10 is... 60!

"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, 100 guests were there at first. Then 24 left early, so that's 100 - 24 = 76 left.

Then 15 stayed late, so that's still 76 guests.

Twice as many checked in as the late checkout folks, so that's 15 x 2 = 30 more guests.

Now we got 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

And 7 more came after dinner, so that's 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

"
"Okay, so John gets lotsa bananas!

He gets 4 on Wednesday, then 6 more on Thursday. That's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.

On Friday, he gets three times the Wednesday bananas, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 bananas.

Now he has 10 + 12 = 22 bananas!


22 

"
"Okay, so there's 60 questions total.

40% of them are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.

Aries gets 75% of those right, so she gets 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions right.

The rest of the questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions.

Those are split evenly between average and difficult, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

She gets half of those right, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 average questions right and 18 / 2 = 9 difficult questions right.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Okay, so they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches a day.

In a week, that's 11 x 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"
"Okay, so Suzanne made money from cookies and cupcakes.

Cookies: 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

Cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total money: $80 + $240 = $320

She gave her sisters: $10/sister * 2 sisters = $20

Money left: $320 - $20 = $300

"
"The twins found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

That leaves 100 - 60 = 40 eggs.

"Okay, so the dwarf mines double with the iron pickaxe, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.

Then with the steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than the 24 pounds, which is 24 * 0.50 = 12 more pounds.

So with the steel pickaxe, he mines 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, 40 dwarves mine 36 pounds each, so that's 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds a day.

In a month of 30 days, they mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.


43200 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

If 2 sandwiches cost $3, then 4 sandwiches cost $6.  That means each sandwich costs $1.50.

So 8 sandwiches would cost 8 times $1.50...

$12



"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bed for 3000 bucks, but he sells his old one for 1000 bucks. That means he still owes 2000 bucks.

Now, he has to pay 10% of that every month.

"
"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Red balloons that burst:** 25 red balloons * 40% = 10 red balloons
* **Red balloons remaining:** 25 red balloons - 10 red balloons = 15 red balloons
* **Yellow balloons released:** 12 yellow balloons / 2 = 6 yellow balloons
* **Yellow balloons remaining:** 12 yellow balloons - 6 yellow balloons = 6 yellow balloons
* **Blue balloons added:** 8 blue balloons * 75% = 6 blue balloons
* **Total balloons carried into school:** 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons

"
"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Chance of NO substitute:** 100% - 50% = 50%
* **Chance of NO extension (with normal teacher):** 100% - 40% = 60%
* **Chance of NO extension AND no dog-eating excuse:** 60% * (100% - 20%) = 60% * 80% = 48%

* **Total chance of having to turn in homework:** 50% (no substitute) * 48% (no extension/excuse) = 24%

"
"Let's see...

We gotta take the total seats and take away the seats for the graduates and the teachers.

That's 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left.

Now we gotta split those seats between all the graduates.

So, 4750 seats / number of graduates = tickets per graduate.

Hmmm... I don't know how many graduates there are.  

 

"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Medium beans:** Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.
* **Small beans:** Since 3 small beans equal 1 medium bean, Grandpa can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

She works 6 hours a day times 3 days, so that's 18 hours total.

She gets $15 a day for 3 days, so that's $45.

But she spends $3 a day for parking for 3 days, so that's $9.

So she makes $45 - $9 = $36.

Now we gotta divide that by the 18 hours... $36 divided by 18 is... $2.

$2 



"
"Okay, so Ted buys some books and pencils.

Books cost 16 dollars each, and he gets 3, so that's 16 times 3, which is 48 dollars.

Pencils are 6 dollars each, and he gets 3, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 dollars.

Now we add the cost of the books and pencils: 48 plus 18 is 66 dollars.

"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Soda bottles:** 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles
* **Trips between bottles:** 8 bottles - 1 (since he starts at the first) = 7 trips

"
"Okay, so Parmesan is $11 a pound and she gets 2 pounds, so that's 11 times 2 which is 22 dollars.

Mozzarella is $6 a pound and she gets 3 pounds, so that's 6 times 3 which is 18 dollars.

All together the cheese costs 22 plus 18 which is 40 dollars.

If she started with 50 dollars and the cheese costs 40 dollars, she has 50 minus 40 which is 10 dollars left.

"
"Okay, so Jim gets 50,000 dollars each year for 4 years, that's 200,000 dollars in loans.

He makes 25,000 a year before college, and his new job pays three times that, so that's 75,000 a year.

He didn't work for 4 years, so he lost out on 25,000 a year times 4 years, which is 100,000 dollars.

So, he needs to make back 200,000 plus 100,000, which is 300,000 dollars.

He makes 75,000 a year, so it will take him 300,000 divided by 75,000 which is 4 years.

"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider, so that means...

* Long side: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
* Wide side: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now we gotta figure out how much fabric that is all together.

* 8 feet times 10 feet = 80 feet

"Okay, lemme see...

* **Tuesday's letters:** One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 / 5 = 85.  They delivered 17 more than that, so 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

* **Wednesday's letters:** Twice the amount on Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204.  They delivered 5 more than that, so 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

* **Total letters:**  425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters

"Okay, so lemme see...

Dad lost 5 bucks first. Then he won more than double that, so that's like 5 times 2 plus 1 more... that's 11 bucks!

Then he lost a lot more than that, like 1.5 times more... so that's 11 times 1.5... that's 16.5 bucks gone!

"Okay, so the car loses 21% of its value every year.

That means in 2008, it's worth 20000 - (21/100)*20000 = 15800 dollars.

Then in 2009, it's worth 15800 - (21/100)*15800 = 12472 dollars.

And finally, in 2010, it's worth 12472 - (21/100)*12472 = 9861.52 dollars.


9861.52

"Okay, lemme see...

So, he starts with 120 folks. Then 20 more get on, so that's 120 + 20 = 140.

Then 50 get off, so that's 140 - 50 = 90.

But then twice the number who got off get on, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 more people.

Now there's 90 + 100 = 190 people.

Finally, 80 get off, so that's 190 - 80 = 110.

"Okay, so James' insurance is more expensive now.

It's 60% more than $120, so that's like adding 60 cents for every dollar.

That means his insurance is $120 + (60/100 * $120) = $192 a month.

Now, to find out how much he pays a year, we multiply that by 12 months: $192 * 12 = $2304

"
"Okay, so he washes 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet every week.

His washer can do 2 twin sheets at once, so that's 4 twin sheets / 2 sheets per load = 2 loads for the twin sheets.

He washes the king sheet in one load.

So that's 2 loads + 1 load = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads a year.

156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday.

On Sunday, they watch half that, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

"Okay, so Betsy took longer than Donovan.  They did it in 98 minutes total.

Let's say Donovan took ""x"" minutes.

Betsy took ""x + 18"" minutes.

Together that's x + (x + 18) = 98

That's 2x + 18 = 98

Take away 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

So Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out a lot of coupons!

He sends out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

Now, the small coupons cost 5 cents each, so that's 700 * $0.05 = $35.00

The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small and big coupons: $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00

"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter per dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

Since the store has a deal where you get one half off when you buy one pound, he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and half price for the other 3.

Three pounds at $4.00 each is $12.00.

Three pounds at half price is $2.00 each, so that's $6.00.

* **Train 2 stay:** Train 2 stays for a quarter of Train 1's time, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
* **Train 3 arrival:** Train 2 leaves at 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes. Train 3 arrives an hour (60 minutes) after Train 2 leaves, so it arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
* **Train 4 arrival:** Train 4 arrives 20 minutes after Train 3 leaves, so it arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

* **Paul's wait:** Paul waits for 145 minutes.

"Okay, so Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is... hmm... lemme see... 75 outta 100 times 2000... that's $1500.

Then he sold it for 120% of that, so 120 outta 100 times $1500... that's $1800.

Now, to figure out the discount his friend got, we gotta see how much less $1800 is than the original $2000. That's $200.

So, the discount is $200 outta $2000... which is... 10%.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **To the halfway point:** James walks 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
* **Time to halfway:** 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.
* **Back home:** He walks another 2 miles.
* **Time back home:** 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.
* **Total time:** 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.
* **To the store (finally!):** He walks 2 miles.
* **Time to the store:** 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

* **Total time for the whole trip:** 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

"Okay, so Jenny buys a lotta bananas!

She gets 10 bunches times 4 bananas per bunch, that's 40 bananas.

If she bought them single, it'd be 40 bananas times $0.80 each, so that's $32.00

But she got 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so that's 10 times $3.00, which is $30.00

So she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

"Hmmm... lemme see... Harry gets more fence, so Sam gets less.  

If they split it even, they'd each get 50 feet. But Harry gets extra, so Sam gets less than 50.

So Sam gets 50 - 60... which is...

* He sold 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

* He sold 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

* That means he sold 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

* Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500

* Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250

* Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

* Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"Okay, so John has 6 + 2 = 8 classes a day.

That's 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes a day.

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes a week.

On the weekend, he spends 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes each day.

That's another 100 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 200 minutes.

In total, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes a week.

Let's see... the big walls are 10 times 8, so that's 80 feet each.  He's got two of those, so that's 80 times 2, which is 160 feet.

The little walls are 5 times 8, so that's 40 feet each. He's got two of those, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80 feet.

Now we add those together: 160 plus 80 is 240 feet.

Each gallon covers 20 feet, so he needs 240 divided by 20, which is 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so 12 gallons will cost 12 times 12, which is $144.

* **Step 2: Calculate the output of the next two workers.**
   They produce 4 toys/hour * 2 workers = 8 toys/hour

* **Step 5: Calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce.**
   The manufacturer needs 400 toys - 200 toys - 20 toys = 180 toys

"Okay, so Sid went 110 miles then another 140 miles. That's a total of 250 miles.

He drove for 2 hours then 3 more hours, so that's 5 hours total.

To find the average speed, you gotta divide the total miles by the total time.

250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

"
"Okay, so Mark's second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one, which has a 20% chance. That means the second ticket has a 20% * 3 = 60% chance of winning.

To get the chance of both tickets winning, we gotta multiply the chances of each one winning together.

So, 20% * 60% = 12%

"
"Okay, so Jim has 27 seashells. Carlos has 5 less than Jim, so he has 22 seashells. Carrey has half of what Carlos has, so he has 11 seashells.

Together they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

They split the seashells equally, so each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Let's see... he eats carrots every day.

He eats 4 carrots on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. That's 4 times 5, which is 20 carrots.

Then he eats 5 carrots on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, so that's 5 plus 5, which is 10 carrots.

So in total, he eats 20 plus 10 carrots, which is 30 carrots.

"
"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than 5 minutes. That means it's like adding 60% of 5 minutes to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 is (60/100) * 5 = 3 minutes.

So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

"Okay, so Linus buys phones for $20 each. He sells them for double, so that's $20 x 2 = $40 each.

He bought 2 phones on Monday and 4 on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 phones.

He makes a profit of $40 - $20 = $20 on each phone.

"Hmm, let's see...

So they make 4200 bottles a day, and each one gives you a bit of energy, like 20% of what you need.  We gotta figure out how many bottles it takes to give everyone all their energy.

2300 people need all their energy, and each bottle only gives 20%, so... that's like...  

*scratches head*

... a lot more bottles!

*counts on fingers*

Okay, so if one bottle is 20%, then we need 5 bottles for each person, right?

*more counting*

So that's 5 bottles times 2300 people...

*struggles with multiplication*

... that's a whole bunch!

11500 bottles!

But they only make 4200 now...

*subtracts on fingers*

"Okay, so Carla has eight babies, right?

Three-quarters wear purple, so that's six babies.

One-quarter wear blue, so that's two babies.

One-third of the purple babies wear bows, so that's two babies.

That means four babies wear bows total.

And two of them are purple.

So, half of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Stacy's eggs:** Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, who found 5, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
* **Charlie's eggs:** Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, who found 10, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* **Mei's eggs:** Mei finds half as many as Charlie, who found 8, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
* **Total found:** In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
* **Eggs remaining:** Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.  So there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden.

"Okay, so John goes to two places with 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last place is 60% bigger than 400, so we gotta figure out 60% of 400.  That's like 60/100 times 400, which is 240.

So the last place has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

That means he collects from a total of 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

He goes to each place 3 times a week, so he collects from 1040 x 3 = 3120 apartments each week.

He makes $.40 for each apartment, so he makes 3120 x $.40 = $1248.00 each week.

* **8-year-old tree:** 1000 fruits - 200 fruits = 800 fruits

* **Step 4: Bills remaining:** He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.
* **Step 5: Tripling his money:** He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills worth $20 each.

* **Days left:** He can use the chalk until it's 2 inches long.  He has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches to use up.

* **Days of use:** Since he uses 20% of the chalk each day, he can use it for 0.75 / (0.20 * 5) = 0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

The third day they got 2 packs of 50, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

So, they used 25 bandages the third day and had 78 left, meaning they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages before using any.

"Okay, so John buys lots of fancy drinks. He gets 10 bottles of scotch, which cost him $600. That means each bottle of scotch costs $600 divided by 10, which is $60.

Now, he wants cognac too. He gets twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 bottles of cognac.

Cognac is fancier, so it costs more. It costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle of cognac costs $60 plus half of $60, which is $30. That means each bottle of cognac costs $90.

So, the cognac costs 20 bottles times $90 per bottle, which is $1800.

To find out how much he spends in total, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 plus $1800, which is $2400.

He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, so that's 40 divided by 4 which is 10 more.

So he planted 40 plus 10, which is 50 Lodgepole Pine on the second day.

Blue ones are trickier, 5 out of 11 of those left. So, 44 divided by 11 is 4, and then times that by 5 is 20 blue fish.

So the whole house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches... that means the second floor is 420 minus 180... which is 240 inches.

Now, the roof is the rest of the second floor, so it's 240 inches minus Mattison's height, which is 60 inches.

John's two classes hold 15 * 2 = 30 students.

Together, both schools can hold 120 + 30 = 150 students.

150 

"
"Okay, so Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2%, which is like a little extra.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $25 times 11, which is $275.

That means he still owes $300 minus $275, which is $25.

But remember, he also owes that extra 2%!  

Let me see... 2% of $300 is $6.

So, in the twelfth month, he needs to pay the $25 he still owes plus the $6 interest, which is $31.

"
"Okay, so Jordan's kids need lots of diaper changes.  

He changes half of them, so let's see... 2 kids times 5 diapers each is 10 diapers total. Half of that is... 5 diapers.


5 

"
"Okay, so the jar is like a box, right?  

It's 6 by 6 on the bottom, so that's 6 times 6, which is 36. Then it's 15 inches tall, so we gotta multiply that by 36. That's 36 times 15, which is 540.

So the jar holds 540 jelly beans if they fit perfect. But they don't, right? They're all bumpy. So we gotta do 540 times 80%, which is like 80 outta every 100. That's 432 jelly beans.

Now, only some are red, like 30%. So we do 432 times 30%, which is like 30 outta every 100. That's 129.6 jelly beans.

He guessed 129.6, but there's really 900.

So he was off by 900 minus 129.6, which is...

770.4 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, 40 people got on at the first stop, and then 3/4 of them got on at the second stop. That's 40 times 3/4, which is 30 people.

So now there's 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

Then they doubled at the third stop, so that's 90 times 2, which is 180 people.

The bus can hold 200, so there's 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.


20 

"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and it costs $2 each time. That's 3 times 2, which is $6 a year.

She does that for 5 years, so that's 6 times 5, which is $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is a lot!  That means it's now 2 plus (2 times 1.5), which is $5 per visit.

She keeps going for 3 more years, so that's 5 times 3, which is $15 a year.

Over those 3 years, she spends 15 times 3, which is $45.

In total, she spent 30 plus 45, which is $75.



75 

"
"Okay, so there's 4 grades, and 10 kids in each grade get to try. That's 40 kids total.

But only 8 can go at once, so we gotta split them into groups.

40 kids / 8 kids per group = 5 groups

Each group gets 45 minutes, so...

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes


225 

"
"Okay, so John made tables and roof frames for his friend.

Let's see... 4 tables times $20 each... that's 4 times 20... hmm... 80 dollars.

And then 2 roof frames times $10 each... so 2 times 10... that's 20 dollars.

Now we gotta add those together... 80 plus 20...

80 + 20 = 100


100 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

If one piece is four times bigger than the other, that means they gotta add up to four plus one, which is five parts total.

So, the board is cut into five equal parts, right?

Forty feet divided by five parts is eight feet per part.

The longer piece is four parts, so it's four times eight feet.

That's thirty-two feet!


32 

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs and gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. That means he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of meat.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so he'll need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


10 

"
"Okay, so Luke has five windows and each one is 35 inches wide.  That means all the windows together are 5 times 35 inches, which is 175 inches. He needs twice that much fabric, so we gotta do 175 times 2.

350 

"
"Okay, so you gotta pay more at first, then less.

First 16 minutes cost 16 times 25 cents, which is 4 bucks.

The rest of the call is 36 minus 16, so 20 minutes.

Those 20 minutes cost 20 times 20 cents, which is 4 bucks.

So the whole call costs 4 plus 4, which is 8 bucks.

8 

"
"Twice the rain on Monday was 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

One more inch than that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.


5 

"
"Okay, so Carly makes brownies and cupcakes.  She makes way more brownies than cupcakes.  She needs enough for everyone in her class to get two treats.

Hmm...

Let's see...

...

5 people times 2 treats each is 10 treats.

 

10 

"
"Okay, so manicure is $35 and pedicure is $40. That's $35 + $40 = $75.

They give a discount if you do both, so it's $75 - ($75 * 0.20) = $60.

Nail art is $3 per nail and she has 10 fingers, so that's $3 * 10 = $30.

So in total, it's $60 + $30 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, so Susan gets 3 magazines times 12 issues each, that's 36 magazines.

Then she gets 6 more from one magazine.

The last one is tricky, it's 6 times 4, so that's 24 magazines.

Now we add them all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66


66 

"
"Okay, so Samantha has less paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has more than Kim.  

Let's see... Samantha has 27, and that's 12 less than Shelley, so Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Shelley has 39, and that's 8 more than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.


31 

"
"Okay, so the toy got real expensive in December, then cheaper in January.  Let me see...

* **December:** $40 + ($40 x 0.80) = $72 
* **January:** $72 - ($72 x 0.50) = $36


$36
"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each normal lesson. That's 4 lessons times $80, which is $320.

Now, for the veterans, he takes off 25% of $80, which is $20. So each veteran lesson costs $60.

He has 2 veteran lessons at $60 each, so that's $120.

Finally, we add the money from the normal lessons and the veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440


$440 

"
"Okay, so you gotta add up all her scores...

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Then you gotta divide that by how many scores there are, which is 9.

630 / 9 = 70

"
"Eve had a bunch of pomelos, then she gave some to her friend. Now she only has a quarter of what she started with.  

That means she gave away three-quarters of her pomelos.

So, she gave away 15 pomelos.

"
"Okay, so Walter ate some apples, then gave some to his sister, and then sold the rest.  

Let's see... 2/5 of 60 apples is... hmm... that's like 60 divided by 5, which is 12, and then times 2... so 24 apples.

That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

His sister got 25% of those... 25% is like a quarter, so that's 36 divided by 4... which is 9 apples.

So Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

He sold those for $3 each, so he got 27 times 3 dollars...

27 * 3 = 81


81 

"
"If 9 novels is 3 quarters, that means she wrote a whole bunch more this year.  

To find out how many she wrote this year, we gotta figure out what one quarter is.

If 9 is three quarters, then one quarter is 9 divided by 3, which is 3.

So, this year she wrote 3 novels for each quarter, and there are 4 quarters in a year.

That means she wrote 3 times 4, which is 12 novels this year.

12 

"
"Okay, so Michael drives 50 clicks every hour, right? And he drives for three whole days. That's a lotta hours!

Let's see... 24 hours in a day times 3 days is 72 hours.

So he drives 50 clicks times 72 hours... that's 3600 clicks!

Now, how much of the 6000 clicks to Texas is that?

Hmm... 3600 divided by 6000... that's 0.6.

So he's covered 60 percent of the way!

0.6 



"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 6 times 5 which is 30 grapes. That's 30 + 6 = 36 grapes already gone.

The pies used 4 pies times 12 grapes per pie which is 48 grapes.

So in total, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes at the beginning.


84

"Okay, so some teachers were sick, and they got helpers.  

Let's see... 82 teachers minus 13 sick teachers is... hmm... a lot less than 82. Then we add the helpers...

79 



"
"Okay, so Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar and twice that on gruyere, so that's $3.00 x 2 = $6.00 on gruyere.

That means his cheese costs $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 total.

Add the pasta and that's $9.00 + $1.00 = $10.00 per week.

In a year, he makes it 52 times, so it costs him $10.00 x 52 = $520.00


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they gotta clean 80 rooms in 5 days, and each room takes 15 minutes.

That's 80 rooms * 15 minutes/room = 1200 minutes of cleaning total.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes a day.

So over 5 days, that's 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes.

Now, to find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we do (1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100% = 50%

50 

"
"Okay, so...

* Middle shelves hold 10 books each.
* Bottom shelf holds twice the middle, so 10 x 2 = 20 books.
* Top shelf holds 5 less than bottom, so 20 - 5 = 15 books.

That's 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

She has 110 books, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

2 



"
"Okay, so Rose buys lotsa eggs, right? Five dozens is like, a whole lotta eggs! She gets 'em cheap, then sells 'em for more.  

Let's see... five dozens is like five times twelve, so that's sixty eggs.

She spends 5 times $2.40, which is... hmm... lemme count on my fingers... that's $12.

Now she sells 'em three at a time for a dollar. So sixty eggs is twenty groups of three.

Twenty groups times a dollar each is... twenty dollars!

So she makes twenty dollars and spends twelve, that means she makes... eight dollars profit!


8 

"
"Okay, so Skyler has lotsa hats!

Half of 100 is 50 red hats.

That leaves 50 hats left.

3/5 of 50 is 30 blue hats.

So that means 20 hats are white.


20 

"
"Okay, so Archie gets a deal on the jerky, right?

The jerky is cheaper by $3.00, so it costs $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now we gotta figure out how much each stick costs.  We divide the price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

But the question wants the answer in cents, so we gotta multiply by 100: $0.50 x 100 = 50 cents


50 

"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to be a smart cookie to get to 7th grade.

First test, she got 60% of 70 questions right. That's like, um... 60 times 70 divided by 100.  

That's 42 questions right on the first test.

Now she needs 70% of all the questions right to pass. That's 70% of 70 plus 40, which is 110 questions.

So, 70% of 110 is... 70 times 110 divided by 100.

That's 77 questions she needs to get right in total.

She already got 42 right, so she needs 77 minus 42 more.

That's 35.

"Hmm, let me see...

She makes a bunch of strawberry ones, and then way more blueberry ones.  

It says the blueberry ones are 5 times the strawberry ones, but then she takes away 4.

"Hmm, lemme see...

She plays lotsa games, 40 each year, and she's been doin' that for four years. So that's 40 times 4, which is 160 games.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start:** Brendan begins with 10 marbles.
* **Drop:** He drops half, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
* **Finds:** He finds 3 of the dropped marbles.
* **Bead:** He removes 1 bead, which isn't a marble.

* **Total:** He has 3 marbles (found) + 7 marbles (remaining in the bag) - 1 bead = 9 marbles.

"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.

For every 2 people who come in, he sells 1 car. So he needs 15 cars * 2 people/car = 30 people to come in.

For every 25 calls, 1 person comes in. So he needs to make 30 people * 25 calls/person = 750 calls.


750 

"
"Okay, so they got 4 people and each has a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.

Then they got 8 rooms and 2 flashlights for each room, so that's 8 times 2, which is 16 flashlights.

Now for the candles... half the rooms is 8 divided by 2, which is 4 rooms.

Those rooms got 4 small candles each, so that's 4 times 4, which is 16 small candles.

The other 4 rooms got 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 times 5, which is 20 medium candles.

So, all together they got 16 small candles plus 20 medium candles, which is 36 candles.

Now we add up all the candles and flashlights: 36 candles plus 4 flashlights plus 16 flashlights, which is 56.

"Okay, so...

* Side 1: 5 minutes
* Side 2: 5 * 2 = 10 minutes
* Side 3: 5 * 2 = 10 minutes
* Side 4: 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes
* Side 5: 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes

Now we add all that up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes


30 

"
"Okay, so there's helmets and footballs and robots...

Helmets is 20, right?

Robots is half the helmets, so that's 20 divided by 2, which is 10 robots.

Footballs is double the helmets, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 footballs.

Now we add them all up: 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70

70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That means he can do 6 hours times 60 minutes per hour, which is 360 minutes of work each day.

Then we gotta see how many 15 minute chunks are in 360 minutes. That's 360 divided by 15, which is 24 calls a day.

He works 5 days a week, so he does 24 calls a day times 5 days, which is 120 calls.

"Okay, so...

* 4 plants need half a cup, that's like 4 times 0.5 cups, which is 2 cups.
* 8 plants need a whole cup, so that's 8 cups.
* The rest of the plants need a quarter cup. That's 20 total plants minus the 4 and the 8, so 8 plants need a quarter cup.
* 8 plants times 0.25 cups is 2 cups.

Now we add it all up: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

"Okay, so Derrick makes a lotta doughnuts, like twelve in a dozen, so that's 10 times 12, which is 120 doughnuts every day.

And he sells each one for 2 bucks, so that's 120 times 2, which is 240 dollars a day.

Now June has 30 days, so he makes 240 times 30, which is... lemme see... 7200 dollars!

"Let's see...

5 blouses times $5.00 is $25.00
2 pants times $8.00 is $16.00
1 skirt times $6.00 is $6.00

"Okay, so John talks real fast now.  He's talkin' like a machine gun!

Let's see... he talks 150 words a minute, and now he's 2.5 times faster, so that's 150 times 2.5... which is 375 words a minute!

He's gotta talk 10 pages times 450 words a page, so that's 4500 words total.

Now we gotta see how many minutes it takes him to say 4500 words at 375 words a minute...

4500 divided by 375 is 12 minutes.

"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people the first day.

Then 50 + 20 = 70 people the next day.

The third day was double the second day, so 70 x 2 = 140 people.

That's 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people for the first three days.

The rest of the week is 7 - 3 = 4 days.

He saw 60 people each of those days, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

In total, Conor saw 260 + 240 = 500 people that week.

"Okay, so we got them big ol' German Shepherds eatin' a lot, and the Bulldogs eatin' less.

Let's see... 3 German Shepherds times 5 kilograms each is 15 kilograms.

Then we got 2 Bulldogs times 3 kilograms each, that's 6 kilograms.

So that's 15 plus 6, which is 21 kilograms a day.

"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, that's 5 times 18, which is 90 miles.

Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so that's 8 times 18, which is 144 miles.

Since he drove east, he's going back towards his house.  So we gotta subtract the distance he drove east from the distance he drove west: 144 - 90 = 54

"Okay, so Gary's boat lost some money each year.

First year: $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 less worth

Now it's worth: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year: $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 less worth

Now it's worth: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year: $4410 * 0.20 = $882 less worth

Now it's worth: $4410 - $882 = $3528

"Okay, so there's lotsa red candies, then double that for orange, and half the reds for yellow.  That leaves the rest to be pink!

Let's see... double the reds is 54 times 2, which is 108 orange candies.

Half the reds is 54 divided by 2, which is 27 yellow candies.

So that's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies that ain't pink.

"Okay, so Helen's hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for 3 nights. That's $80 x 3 = $240 for the hotel.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 x 0.10 = $8.

She took the bus 7 times, so that's $8 x 7 = $56 for the bus.

In total, she spent $240 + $56 = $296.

"Hmm, lemme see... Dallas had some marbles, then lost some...

So Dallas has 21 now, but he lost 4, so he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before.

In a week, that's 40 times 7, which is 280 pounds.

If he started with 300 pounds and they eat 280, he has 300 minus 280 left.

"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people times 2 hot dogs each, that's 40 hot dogs.

He already has 4, so he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Each pack has 6, so he needs 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12.

"
"Okay, so Frances makes money from sellin' cupcakes and cookies.

Cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

Cookies: 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Total money made: $40 + $40 = $80

Trays: 5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Money left: $80 - $20 = $60

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Street 2:** Each of the 5 children brings a friend, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 children.
* **Street 3:** Each of the 10 children brings 2 more friends, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 children.
* **Leaving:** The original 5 children leave, so there are 20 - 5 = 15 children left.

"Mamou gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

She has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left.

"
"Okay, so a quarter is worth 25 cents. Two nickels are worth 10 cents. And seven dimes are worth 70 cents.

Let's add it all up: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105

"
"Let's see...

The older brother is twice as old as the younger one, so he's 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

All the sisters are 16, so together they are 16 * 3 = 48 years old.

Now, let's add up all their ages: 24 + 12 + 48 = 84


84 

"
"Okay, so she meditates twice a day, 15 minutes each time, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 minutes a day.

She does yoga for an hour, which is 60 minutes, 5 days a week.

So that's 30 minutes of meditation + 60 minutes of yoga = 90 minutes a day.

In a week, that's 90 minutes a day * 7 days = 630 minutes.

Over 4 weeks, it's 630 minutes a week * 4 weeks = 2520 minutes.

"
"Okay, so she's got little shirts, medium shirts, and big shirts.  

Let's see... 11 little shirts times 3 feet each is 33 feet.

Then 8 medium shirts times 4 feet each is 32 feet.

And 6 big shirts times 6 feet each is 36 feet.

Now we gotta add all that up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 feet!

"
"A dozen has 12 things in it, so a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more than 36 seeds, which is 36 / 2 = 18 more seeds.

So a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Altogether, there are 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that, so he has 18 x 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.


27 

"
"Okay, so Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36"". That means Anne is 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall.

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.

She grew 3"" over the summer, so before summer she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 bars a day and sell them for 2 dollars each. That's 5000 times 2, which is 10,000 dollars a day.

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, that's 2 times 7, which is 14 days.

So, they make 10,000 dollars a day for 14 days... that's 10,000 times 14.

140,000 



"
"Okay, so Jake gets two shirts, but one is half off.  That means one shirt is $8 and the other is $4.  So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are $40, but they're 40% off, so that's $40 x 0.40 = $16 off.

That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

So the shirts cost $12 and the shoes cost $24, for a total of $12 + $24 = $36.

"
"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 a week for 3 weeks, that's $6 x 3 = $18.

Then he buys ice cream for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice creams at $1.25 each, which is $1.25 x 4 = $5.

So he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"
"Okay, so Ellen spent 100 plus 5, which is 105. Lani spent 30 plus 100 plus 100, which is 230.  Now we add Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: 105 plus 230 is 335.


335 

"
"Okay, so Tim needs stuff to make his mix. Passion fruit is $6 a pound and he uses 2 pounds, so that's 6 times 2 which is $12.  Jackfruit is $8 a pound and he uses 1.5 pounds, so that's 8 times 1.5 which is $12.  Honey is $10 a pound and he uses 2 pounds, so that's 10 times 2 which is $20.

So for one jar, the stuff costs $12 + $12 + $20 which is $44.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 which is $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 times 10 which is $60.

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much money Justin has.

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 32 quarters is 32 x 25 = 800 cents.
* Dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 95 dimes is 95 x 10 = 950 cents.
* Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 120 nickels is 120 x 5 = 600 cents.
* Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 750 pennies is 750 cents.

Now we add up all the cents: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents.

There are 100 cents in a dollar, so Justin has 3100 / 100 = 31 dollars.

"
"Okay, so Janet spends money on ice cream, movies, and a bracelet.  Then we gotta see how much money she has left from what her parents gave her.

Let's see...

Ice cream is $3.50.

Two movie tickets are $7.50 each, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00

The bracelet is $8.50.

So all together she spends $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Her parents gave her $40.00

So she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00 

"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week.

He makes 3 cars a day times $4 a car, so that's $12 a day.

In a week, he makes $12 a day times 5 days, so that's $60 a week.

Two weeks is double a week, so he makes $60 times 2, which is $120.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Start:** Randy has 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.
* **Snack:** He eats 3, leaving him with 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.
* **Lunch:** He eats 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.
* **Friends:** He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.
* **Baking:** He bakes 4 of each flavor, adding 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.
* **Total:** He now has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Half of 12 is 6.

So, 6 toys times $5 is $30.

The other 6 toys times $7 is $42.

$30 plus $42 is... $72!

"
"Okay, so the dog digs a bunch of holes while Nate's gone. Then Nate fills some, but the dog digs more.  

Let's see... 6 holes a day for 14 days is... hmm... 6 times 14 is 84 holes.

So there's 84 holes to start.

Nate fills 9 a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night. So that's like Nate only fills 3 holes a day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill 84 holes at 3 holes a day... that's 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).

There are 7 days in a week, so 28 days is 4 weeks (28 / 7 = 4).

"
"Okay, so Norman High School has 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 of that, so that's like 3 groups of 1000 students.

3 groups of 1000 is 3000 students.

Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

"
"Hmm, let's see... they made a bunch of cookies, right?  

They got 2595 rainbow ones and 3075 oatmeal ones. That's a lot of cookies already!

If they made 7995 in total, we gotta take away the rainbow and oatmeal ones to see how many chocolate chip ones they made.

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Test tubes:** Igor got half the test tubes, so he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor got two more than requested, so he got 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items Igor got:** He got 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items in total.
* **Beakers lost:** Igor lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

"
"Okay, so James has 4 tables times 4 legs each, that's 16 legs.

Then he needs 2 screws for each leg, so that's 16 legs times 2 screws, which is 32 screws.

He started with 40 screws and uses 32, so he has 40 minus 32 left.


8 

"
"Okay, so there's 10 eggs in the first basket.

The second basket has twice that, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 eggs.

Now we gotta add them together, 10 plus 20...

"
"Okay, so Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180


2180 

"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one. 

Let's see... Aaron is fast, but Vanessa goes further.  If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron is twice as fast, he must have run 2 miles.

If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, that means he runs 1 mile in 8 minutes.

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 2 miles, Vanessa ran 4 miles.

If Aaron runs a mile in 8 minutes, Vanessa must take twice as long, so she takes 16 minutes per mile.

So Vanessa took 16 minutes per mile times 4 miles...

64 



"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he's got 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 times 200 feet of line, which is 600 feet. But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 minus 6 feet.

594 

"
"Okay, so they get 6 people each night, and those people each spend $5 x 2 meals + $5 for wine = $15.

So each night they make 6 people x $15 = $90.

They're open 2 days a week, so they make $90 x 2 = $180 a week.


180 

"
"Okay, so he made extra money, right?  That means he got more than $80 back.

Let's see... 25% of 80 is like a quarter of 80... which is 20 bucks.

So he made 20 extra dollars.

That means he got 80 + 20 = 100 dollars total.

Now he sold 50 watermelons, so each one cost... 100 / 50 = 2 dollars.



2 

"
"Okay, so Dora is gonna be 12 soon, but she ain't there yet. That means she's 9 now.

James is twice her age, so he's 18.

John had James when he was 19, so he's 19 + 18 = 37 now.

His youngest son was born when John was 32, so he's 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, he'll be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"
"Hmm, let's see...

An hour is 60 minutes.

Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes, so in an hour she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes, so in an hour she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"
"Okay, so the radiator was 80% off, so that's like... a really big discount!

Let's see, 80% of 400 is... hmm...  That's a lot of math.

But the mechanic cost 3 hours times $50, so that's 150 bucks.

So, the radiator was cheap, and the mechanic cost 150...

Let's just say he paid around 200 bucks.

"Okay, so they got 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's a lotta pizza!  

There's 4 friends in total, right? Henry plus his 3 buddies.

Then we gotta split those 56 slices between the 4 friends.

56 divided by 4 is... 14!
