* **Let 'l' be the number of games lost.**

We know:

* **w + l = 22** (total games played)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w':

1. **Substitute 'l + 8' for 'w' in the first equation:**  (l + 8) + l = 22

2. **Combine like terms:** 2l + 8 = 22

3. **Subtract 8 from both sides:** 2l = 14

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about the leaks:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in water between them is changing because of the leaks.

* **The difference:**  Since the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago and now has four times as much, it means the big pool lost 2 times the amount of water the small pool lost in those 4 minutes.

* **Let's use 'x' :** Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.

* **Big pool then:** 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x water.

* **Big pool now:** Now, the big pool has 4x water.

* **Water lost by big pool:** The big pool lost 4x - 2x = 2x water in 4 minutes.

* **Water lost by small pool:** The small pool lost x water in 4 minutes.

* **The leak rate:** We know both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute. So, the big pool lost 2x gallons in 4 minutes, meaning it lost 2x / 4 = x/2 gallons per minute.

* **Since the leak rate is the same:** The small pool also loses x/2 gallons per minute.

* **Finding 'x':**  In 4 minutes, the small pool lost x/2 * 4 = 2x gallons. This means the small pool now has x - 2x = -x gallons.

* **We can't have negative water:** This means there's an error in our thinking. Let's go back and check our assumptions. 

It seems like there's a problem with the information given in the question. It's impossible for the big pool to have twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago and then four times as much now if they are both leaking at the same rate.

"If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left.

We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is.

We can do this by dividing 12.8 hectares by 2: 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 hectares.

Since 1/5 of his land is 6.4 hectares, we can find the total land by multiplying that amount by 5: 6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out how far the horse runs:**

* There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour.
* The horse runs 32 miles per hour, so in half an hour it runs 32 / 2 = 16 miles.

**2. Calculate how much hay the horse eats:**

* The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and it runs 16 miles, so it eats 1/2 * 16 = 8 bails of hay.

**3. Find the total cost of the hay:**

* Each bail of hay costs $3, and the horse eats 8 bails, so the total cost is $3 * 8 = $24.

**4. Calculate how much money Michael starts with:**

* Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has 6 * $5 = $30.

**5. Figure out Michael's change:**

* Michael has $30 and the hay costs $24, so his change is $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's solve this problem step by step!

* **Let's use letters:**

   *  Let 'B' be the number of insects Bodhi found.
   *  Let 'D' be the number of insects David found.
   *  Let 'L' be the number of insects Lily found.

* **We know:**

   * B + D + L = 43 (They found 43 insects together)
   * L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
   * D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Now we can use substitution to solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

   1. **Since D = B/2, we can substitute that into the equation L = D + 7:**
      L = (B/2) + 7

   2. **Now we can substitute both D = B/2 and L = (B/2) + 7 into the equation B + D + L = 43:**
      B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

   3. **Simplify the equation:**
      B + B + 7 = 43
      2B + 7 = 43

"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

To lose one pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories.

So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105000 calories.

Now, let's see how many days he has until his birthday.

December has 31 days, so there are 31 - 31 = 0 days left in December.

January has 31 days.

February has 28 days (it's not a leap year).

2. **Large buttons from small stickers:** Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons from the small stickers.

3. **Large stickers for large buttons:** Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

4. **Large buttons from large stickers:** She gets 20 large buttons from these large stickers.

5. **Remaining large stickers:** She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

6. **Small buttons from remaining large stickers:** Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total large buttons:** Lorraine has 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

8. **Total buttons:** She has 47 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's start with the zest:**  Let's say Tanya uses 'x' ounces of citrus zest.

* **Fragrance:** She uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she also uses 'x' ounces of fragrance.

* **Salt:** She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2 * x = 2x ounces of salt.

* **Sugar:** She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she also uses 2x ounces of sugar.

* **Oil:** She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2x = 4x ounces of oil.

* **Total:** The total amount of ingredients is x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10x ounces.

* **We know the total is 10 ounces:** So, 10x = 10 ounces.

* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 10: x = 1 ounce.

* **Oil:** Tanya uses 4x ounces of oil, so she uses 4 * 1 = 4 ounces of oil.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use letters to represent the number of cards each person has:**
    * PJ = P
    * Smendrick = S
    * Becca = B

* **We know:**
    * B + S + P = 341 (total cards)
    * B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)
    * S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards)

* **Now we can use substitution to solve for B (Becca's cards):**

1. **Since S = 3P, we can substitute 3P for S in the first equation:**
   B + 3P + P = 341

2. **Combine like terms:**
   B + 4P = 341

3. **Since B = S + 12, and S = 3P, we can substitute 3P + 12 for B:**
   (3P + 12) + 4P = 341

4. **Combine like terms:**
   7P + 12 = 341

5. **Subtract 12 from both sides:**
   7P = 329

6. **Divide both sides by 7:**
   P = 47 (PJ has 47 cards)

7. **Now that we know P, we can find S:**
   S = 3P = 3 * 47 = 141 (Smendrick has 141 cards)

8. **Finally, we can find B:**
   B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 (Becca has 153 cards)

    *  Let 'B' be the number of points Bahati scored.
    *  Let 'A' be the number of points Azibo scored.
    *  Let 'D' be the number of points Dinar scored.

* **We know:**
    * B + A + D = 45 (Their total points)
    * B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)

* **Let's use the information to figure out Azibo's points (A):**

    1. Since B = A + 20, we can substitute that into the first equation: (A + 20) + A + D = 45

    2. Simplify: 2A + D + 20 = 45

    3.  We also know B = D + 10, so D = B - 10. Substitute that in: 2A + (B - 10) + 20 = 45

    4. Simplify: 2A + B + 10 = 45

    5. Now we have two equations:
        * 2A + B + 10 = 45
        * B = A + 20

    6. Substitute the second equation into the first: 2A + (A + 20) + 10 = 45

    7. Simplify: 3A + 30 = 45

    8. Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15

    9. Divide both sides by 3: A = 5

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'A' be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.
*  Let 'S' be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'X' be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.

**Set up equations based on the information given:**

*  A + S + X = 339 (They caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  X = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4A - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount)

**Now we can solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ( (4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339
   9A - 21 = 339

3. **Add** 21 to both sides:
   9A = 360

4. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   A = 40  (Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon)

5. **Substitute** the value of A back into the equation S = 4A - 13:
   S = (4 * 40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

* **Step 2: Calculate the number of bills after losing some:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* **Step 3: Calculate the number of bills used for payment:** He uses half of his remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* **Step 4: Calculate the number of bills left after payment:** He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.
* **Step 5: Calculate the amount of money after tripling:** He triples his money, so he has 20 bills * $20 per bill * 3 = $1200.
* **Step 6: Calculate the number of 5 dollar bills:** He has $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 five dollar bills.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chalk left after Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, so he has 100% - 45% = 55% left.
* **Chalk remaining in inches:** 55% of 5 inches is (55/100) * 5 = 2.75 inches.
* **Days of chalk left:** The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, so he can use the remaining chalk for 2.75 inches / (20/100 * 5 inches) = 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

Since the teacher can't use a piece smaller than 2 inches, he can use the chalk for **2** more days.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use letters:** Let Wendy's current age be ""W"" and Colin's current age be ""C"".

* **Seven years from now:** Colin will be C + 7 years old.

* **Wendy is five times as old:** This means W = 5 * (C + 7)

* **In 25 years:** Colin will be C + 25 years old.

* **A third as old as Wendy now:** This means C + 25 = (1/3) * W

Now we have two equations:

1. W = 5 * (C + 7)
2. C + 25 = (1/3) * W

Let's solve for C (Colin's current age):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   C + 25 = (1/3) * (5 * (C + 7))

2. **Simplify:** C + 25 = (5/3) * C + (35/3)

3. **Solve for C:**
   (8/3) * C = (35/3) - 25
   (8/3) * C = (35/3) - (75/3)
   (8/3) * C = -40/3
   C = (-40/3) * (3/8)
   C = -10/2
   C = -5

Since age cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for Colin to be -5 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4.**
* **Let's guess that all the animals are chickens:** 20 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 40 legs. That's not enough legs!
* **Let's try some cows:** If we have 1 cow, that's 4 legs.  That leaves 19 chickens (20 total animals - 1 cow).
* **Calculate the legs:** 19 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 38 legs.  1 cow * 4 legs/cow = 4 legs. 38 + 4 = 42 legs. Still not enough!
* **Keep trying:** Let's try 2 cows. That's 8 legs. That leaves 18 chickens.
* **Calculate the legs:** 18 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 36 legs. 2 cows * 4 legs/cow = 8 legs. 36 + 8 = 44 legs.  Getting closer!
* **Keep going:** Let's try 3 cows. That's 12 legs. That leaves 17 chickens.
* **Calculate the legs:** 17 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 34 legs. 3 cows * 4 legs/cow = 12 legs. 34 + 12 = 46 legs. Almost there!
* **One more try:** Let's try 4 cows. That's 16 legs. That leaves 16 chickens.
* **Calculate the legs:** 16 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 32 legs. 4 cows * 4 legs/cow = 16 legs. 32 + 16 = 48 legs. Still not enough!
* **Let's try 5 cows:** That's 20 legs. That leaves 15 chickens.
* **Calculate the legs:** 15 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 30 legs. 5 cows * 4 legs/cow = 20 legs. 30 + 20 = 50 legs. Too many!
* **Go back to 4 cows:** We know 4 cows is too few legs, and 5 cows is too many. 

Let's try a mix of chickens and cows to get to 70 legs.

* **Let's try 12 chickens and 8 cows:**
    * 12 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 24 legs
    * 8 cows * 4 legs/cow = 32 legs

* **Let's try 14 chickens and 6 cows:**
    * 14 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 28 legs
    * 6 cows * 4 legs/cow = 24 legs
    * 28 + 24 = 52 legs. Still not enough!

* **Let's try 16 chickens and 4 cows:**
    * 16 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 32 legs
    * 4 cows * 4 legs/cow = 16 legs
    * 32 + 16 = 48 legs.  Not enough!

* **Let's try 18 chickens and 2 cows:**
    * 18 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 36 legs
    * 2 cows * 4 legs/cow = 8 legs
