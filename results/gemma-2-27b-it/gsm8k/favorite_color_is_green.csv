* Since both salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
* Let Lylah's salary four years later be 'y'.
*  We know Adrien's salary four years later ($56000) is 1.30 times Lylah's salary four years later (y).

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Leak:**

* Both pools are losing water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

**2.  The Difference:**

*  Since the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago and now has four times as much, this means the big pool lost 2 times the amount of water the small pool lost in those 4 minutes.

**3.  Set up the Equation:**

* Let 'x' be the amount of water the small pool has now.
* The small pool lost 4x gallons in the last 4 minutes.
* The big pool lost 8x gallons in the last 4 minutes (twice the small pool).

**4.  The Current Ratio:**

* The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning:  x * 4 = current amount in big pool

**5.  Putting it Together:**

*  We know the big pool had twice the water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, so:
    * Big pool then: x * 2 + 8x = current amount in big pool
    * Small pool then: x + 4x = current amount in small pool + 4x

* Since the big pool's current amount is 4 times the small pool's current amount, we can set up the equation:
    * x * 2 + 8x = 4 * (x + 4x)

**6. Solve for x:**

* x * 2 + 8x = 4 * 5x
* 10x = 20x
* -10x = 0
* x = 0

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of sections:** The redwood is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet long, so there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

2. **Calculate the original weight:** Each section weighs 400 pounds, and there are 20 sections, so the redwood originally weighed 400 * 20 = 8000 pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight lost to termites:** Termites ate 30% of the wood, so they ate 8000 * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

4. **Calculate the remaining weight:** The redwood now weighs 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Let 'h' represent the number of chickens.

**2. Formulate equations:**

* We know that c + h = 60 (total animals)

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the distance traveled:**

* The horse runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour).
* Distance = Speed x Time = 32 MPH x 0.5 hours = 16 miles

**2. Calculate the hay consumed:**

* Hay consumed = Distance x Hay per mile = 16 miles x 0.5 bail/mile = 8 bails

**3. Calculate the total cost of the hay:**

* Total cost = Hay consumed x Price per bail = 8 bails x $3/bail = $24

**4. Calculate Michael's total money:**

* Total money = Number of bills x Value per bill = 6 bills x $5/bill = $30

**5. Calculate the change:**

* Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  D = B / 2  (David found half of what Bodhi found)
*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

**Now we can solve for the number of insects Lily found (L):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (D = B/2) into the second equation:
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the first equation (D = B/2) and the modified second equation (L = B/2 + 7) into the third equation:
   (B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Simplify and solve for B:**
   B + 7 + B = 43
   2B + 7 = 43
   2B = 36
   B = 18

4. **Now that you know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), substitute it back into the equation D = B/2 to find D:**
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9

5. **Finally, substitute the value of D (9) into the equation L = D + 7 to find L:**
   L = 9 + 7

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  **z** = ounces of zest
*  **s** = ounces of salt
*  **o** = ounces of oil
*  **f** = ounces of fragrance

**We know:**

* **z = f** (same amount of zest as fragrance)
* **s = 2z** (twice as much salt as zest)
* **o = 2s** (twice as much oil as salt)
* **z + s + o + f + sugar = 10** (total ounces in the jar)

**Let's substitute to solve for 'o' (oil):**

1. **Since z = f, we can rewrite the equation as:** z + s + o + z + sugar = 10
2. **Substitute s = 2z:** z + 2z + o + z + sugar = 10
3. **Combine like terms:** 4z + o + sugar = 10
4. **Substitute o = 2s and s = 2z:** 4z + 2(2z) + sugar = 10
5. **Simplify:** 4z + 4z + sugar = 10
6. **Combine like terms:** 8z + sugar = 10

**We don't know the exact amount of sugar, but we can express the oil in terms of 'z':**

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Anthony's savings:** Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, who has $20.00. So Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

2. **Roy's savings:** Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, who has $30.00.  
   * Calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: $30.00 * 0.40 = $12.00

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let Peter's age be ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
*  Let John's age be ""J""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age is 100)
*  Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
*  P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

**Now we can solve for Peter's age (P):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** the values of Pa and P from the previous steps into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:**

    *  A + S + X = 339 (Together they caught 339 Pokemon)

* **Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify and solve for A:**
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   9A - 21 = 339
   9A = 360
   A = 40

3. **Substitute the value of A back into the equation for S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147



**Answer:** 147

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**

   The power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours, so it lost a total of 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

   If it lost 45%, it had 100 - 45 = 55% of its charge remaining.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**

   It lost 7% per hour for 3 hours, totaling 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours:**

   After losing another 21%, it had 55 - 21 = 34% of its original charge remaining.

* **Step 5: Determine the original charge:**

   We know 34% represents the final charge of 28%.  Let 'x' be the original charge. We can set up the equation: 0.34x = 28

* **Step 6: Solve for x:**

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  r = 4b  (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
*  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
*  r + b + y = 37 (The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters)

**Now we can solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation into the first equation to get: r = 4(y - 7)
2. **Simplify:** r = 4y - 28
3. **Substitute** both the simplified first equation and the second equation into the third equation: (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37
4. **Combine like terms:** 6y - 35 = 37
5. **Add 35 to both sides:** 6y = 72
6. **Divide both sides by 6:** y = 12 
7. **Substitute the value of y back into the equation b = y - 7:** b = 12 - 7 = 5

   (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

"Here's how to solve this classic word problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**We know:**

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Now we can solve using substitution or elimination. Here's the substitution method:**

   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
