* *q + b + w = 700* (total number of bees)

**Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees (w):**

1. **Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the third equation:**  *q + 2q + w = 700*
2. **Combine like terms:** *3q + w = 700*
3. **Substitute '2b' for 'w' and '2q' for 'b':** *3q + 2(2q) = 700*

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let:**

*  *d* represent the number of players on defense
*  *o* represent the number of players on offense
*  *s* represent the number of players on special teams

**We know:**

* *o = 2d* (twice as many players on offense as defense)
* *s = d / 2* (half the number of players on special teams as defense)
* *d + o + s = 105* (total number of players)

**Now we can substitute and solve for *d*:**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   *d + 2d + (d/2) = 105*

2. **Combine** like terms:
   *3.5d = 105*

3. **Divide** both sides by 3.5:
   *d = 30*

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  L = D + 7  (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
*  L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

**Now we can solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (D = B/2) into the first equation:
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the first and second equations into the third equation:
   (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Simplify** and solve for B:
   2B + 7 = 43
   2B = 36
   B = 18

4. **Now that you know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), substitute it back into the equation D = B/2:**

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
* Ava collects y + 3 berries.
* Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, meaning Emma has 4 more seconds left on the timer.

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
2. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

**Find Becca's cards:**

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' be the length of Elaina's usual concert.**
* The final concert is twice the length of a usual concert, so it's 2x minutes long.
* The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, making the total length 2x + 15 minutes.
* We know the total length of the final concert is 65 minutes.

**Setting up the equation:**

2x + 15 = 65

**Solving for x:**

1. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let Peter's age be ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
*  Let John's age be ""J""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age is 100)
*  Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
*  P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

**Now we can solve for Peter's age (P):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** the values of Pa and P from the previous steps into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:**

"Let's break down the problem:

* Let 'x' represent the number of points Azibo scored.
* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Bahati also scored 10 more than Dinar, so Dinar scored x + 20 - 10 = x + 10 points.

* The total points are 45, so x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5

**Day 1:**

* **Wanda's water:** (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons
* **Ms. B's water:** (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons
* **Total water on Day 1:** 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons

**Day 2:**

* **Wanda's water:** (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank loses 9% per hour for 5 hours, so it loses a total of 9% * 5 = 45% of its charge.
* This means it has 100% - 45% = 55% of its charge remaining.

**2. Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank now loses 7% per hour for 3 hours, totaling 7% * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* After these 3 hours, it has 55% - 21% = 34% of its charge remaining.

**3. Determine the initial charge:**

* We know that 34% represents the final charge of 28%.  Let 'x' be the initial charge.
* We can set up a proportion: 34% / x = 28% / 100%
* Cross-multiply: 34 * 100 = 28 * x
* Solve for x: x = (34 * 100) / 28 = 121.43 (approximately)

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find Grandma's beach speed:** Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her beach speed is 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 3 miles per hour.

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  r = 4b  (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
*  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
*  r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

**Now we can solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the value of 'b' from the second equation into the first equation:
   r = 4(y - 7)

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   r = 4y - 28

3. **Substitute** the values of 'r' and 'b' from the previous steps into the third equation:
   (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

4. **Combine** like terms:
   6y - 35 = 37

5. **Add** 35 to both sides:
   6y = 72

6. **Divide** both sides by 6:
   y = 12
