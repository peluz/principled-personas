* **Understand the Leak:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

* **The Difference:**  Since the big pool lost the same amount of water as the small pool in the last 4 minutes, the difference in water between them is due to the initial difference, not the leak.

* **Set up Ratios:**

    * Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.
    * 4 minutes ago, the small pool had x + 16 gallons (since it lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
    * 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2(x + 16) gallons.
    * Now, the big pool has 4x gallons.

* **Create an Equation:** The difference in water between the pools 4 minutes ago is the same as the difference now:

   2(x + 16) - (x + 16) = 4x - x

* **Solve for x:**

   2x + 32 - x - 16 = 3x
   x + 16 = 3x

* **Think about fractions:** If 3/5 of the land was sold, then 2/5 of the land is left (because 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).
* **Set up a proportion:** We know 2/5 of the land equals 12.8 hectares. Let 'x' represent the original amount of land.  This can be written as: (2/5) * x = 12.8

* **Solve for x:** To isolate 'x', multiply both sides of the equation by (5/2):

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Oven Heating:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, and it's on for 3 hours, so the temperature increases by 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

2. **Temperature After Baking:** The initial temperature was 40 degrees, and it increased by 15 degrees, so the temperature is now 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. **Window Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The temperature drops 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it drops 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

4. **Final Temperature:** The temperature was 55 degrees and dropped by 6 degrees, resulting in a final temperature of 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

**2. Calculate James's swim time:**

* 10% of Jon's swim time is (10/100) * 40 minutes = 4 minutes
* James's swim time = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes

**3. Calculate James's bike time:**

* James's bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

**4. Calculate James's total time:**

* James's total time = 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time

**5. Set up an equation to find James's run time:**

* Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon's.
* James's total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes

* **Venue 2 Cost:** $25x (price per guest, including food)

**To find when the costs are equal, set the two equations equal to each other:**

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solve for x:**

1. Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
2. Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  D = B / 2  (David found half of what Bodhi found)
*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

**Now we can solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (D = B/2) into the second equation:
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the first equation (D = B/2) and the modified second equation (L = B/2 + 7) into the third equation:
   (B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Simplify and solve for B:**
   B + 7 + B = 43
   2B + 7 = 43
   2B = 36
   B = 18

4. **Now that you know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), substitute it back into the equation D = B/2 to find D:**
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9

5. **Finally, substitute the value of D (9) into the equation L = D + 7 to find L:**
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Salt and sugar each equal '2x' (twice the amount of zest).
*  Oil equals '4x' (twice the amount of salt).

**Total ounces:**

* x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces

**Combine like terms:**

* 10x = 10 ounces

**Solve for x:**

* x = 1 ounce

**Calculate the amount of oil:**

* Oil = 4x = 4 * 1 ounce = 4 ounces

*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
2. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

**Find Becca's cards:**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims before resting.**

* 60% of 20 miles = (60/100) * 20 miles = 12 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the time spent swimming the first part.**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the rest time.**

* Rest time = Swimming time / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**

* Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already swam
* Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

**Step 5: Calculate the time spent swimming the remaining distance.**

* Speed for the remaining distance = Original speed / 2 = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour
* Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the total time.**

* Total time = Swimming time (first part) + Rest time + Swimming time (second part)
* Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'X' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + X = 339  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  X = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4A - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe)

**Now we can solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ( (4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Donovan's part took 'x' minutes.

Betsy's part took 'x + 18' minutes.

Together, their time adds up to 98 minutes: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.

Betsy's part took x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
*  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
*  r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

**Now we can solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (b = y - 7) into the first equation:
   r = 4(y - 7)

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   r = 4y - 28

3. **Substitute** both the simplified equation for 'r' and the equation for 'b' into the third equation:
   (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

4. **Combine** like terms:
   6y - 35 = 37

5. **Add** 35 to both sides:
   6y = 72

6. **Divide** both sides by 6:
   y = 12

7. **Now that you know y (yellow rope length), substitute it back into the equation b = y - 7:**
   b = 12 - 7
   b = 5

8. **Finally, substitute the value of 'b' into the equation r = 4b:**
   r = 4 * 5
   r = 20

"Here's how to solve this word problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"": w = 5(c + 7)
* ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Solve the first equation for ""w"":**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for ""c"":**
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = (40/3) * (3/2)
   c = 20

**Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

3. **John's current age:** John was 19 when James was born, so he is currently 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

4. **Youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so the son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can use a system of equations to solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
