"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**2.  Find the Unit Value:**

*  Since the ratio is 7:13, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 
*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
*  To find the value of one part, divide the total sugar by the ratio: 120 teaspoons / 7 = 17.14 teaspoons per part.

**3. Calculate the Sugar Used:**

*  Since Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar, and each part is 17.14 teaspoons, multiply that value by the number of parts: 17.14 teaspoons/part * 120 teaspoons = 206.08 teaspoons.

**4.  Round to the Nearest Whole Number:**

*  Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, round the answer to the nearest whole number.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago:**

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary now:**

* Adrien's salary now is $40000 * 1.40 (40% increase) = $56000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**

* Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation: 
   * Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30 
   * $40000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30
   * Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.30 = $3077 (approximately)

**4. Calculate Lylah's salary now:**

* Lylah's salary now is $3077 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

**5. Calculate Adrien and Lylah's total salary four years later:**

* Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56000 + $4300 = $60300

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know w = 2b (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
    * We also know b = 2q (There are twice as many babies as queens)

* **Solve for the number of bees:**
    * Since we know b = 2q, substitute this into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q
    * We know there are 700 bees in total, so: q + b + w = 700
    * Substitute b = 2q and w = 4q into the equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700
    * Combine like terms: 7q = 700
    * Solve for q: q = 100 
    * Now that you know q = 100, substitute it back into the equation b = 2q: b = 2 * 100 = 200

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Billy's change:**

* Billy started with $10.00
* Candy cost $1.50 per pound, so he spent $1.50 * x pounds = $10.00 - $1.50x 
* We need to find the value of x, the number of pounds of candy.

**2. Calculate the cost of the gumballs:**

* Gumballs cost $0.05 each, and he bought 40, so the total cost is 40 * $0.05 = $2.00

**3. Set up an equation:**

* Billy's change is half of his original amount, so he has $10.00 - $1.50x = $5.00
* We can solve for x (the number of pounds of candy)

**4. Solve for x:**

* $10.00 - $1.50x = $5.00
* Subtract $10.00 from both sides: -$1.50x = -$5.00
* Divide both sides by -$1.50: x = 3.33 pounds

* The total distance for one round trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

**3. Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:**

* The train travels 225 miles per round trip, and it does this 3 times a day, so it travels 225 * 3 = 675 miles in a day.

**4. Calculate the number of days between services:**

* The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
* Divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

**1. Calculate Jon's total time:**

* Swim: 40 minutes
* Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 70 minutes
* Run: 50 minutes
* Total: 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 minutes

**2. Calculate James's time for each leg:**

* **Swim:** Jon is 10% faster, so James's swim time is 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.
* **Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon, so his bike time is 70 minutes + 5 minutes = 75 minutes.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Find the point where the costs are equal:**

We want to find the number of guests where the two venues have the same cost.  So, set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

**Answer:** 8 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = z (same amount of zest and fragrance)
    *  y = z (same amount of salt and sugar)
    *  o = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
    *  y = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)

* **Solve for the amount of oil (o):**
    * Since y = 2x, we can substitute that into the equation for o: o = 2 * (2x) = 4x
    * We know x = z, so o = 4z

* **We need to find the value of z (salt) to get the amount of oil.** 

* **We can use the fact that the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces:**
    *  Salt (z) + Sugar (z) + Zest (x) + Oil (o) = 10 ounces
    *  Since z = x, we can substitute: 2z + z + z + 4z = 10 ounces
    *  Simplifying: 8z = 10 ounces
    *  Solving for z: z = 10/8 ounces = 1.25 ounces

* **Now that we know z (salt), we can find the amount of oil:**
    * o = 4z = 4 * 1.25 ounces = 5 ounces

**Answer:** Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the value of 'A' from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the value of 'S' from the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** and solve for 'W':
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40 

5. **Substitute** the value of 'W' back into the third equation to find 'S':
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 91% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know that 9% of the initial charge is lost each hour, so after 5 hours, the power bank had 91% of its capacity remaining. 
* This means: 0.91x = 1 - 0.09 * 5 
* Solving for x: 0.91x = 0.865
* Therefore, x = 0.865 / 0.91 = 0.95 (approximately)

**Step 2: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 91% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 
* The initial charge was 0.95. 
* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 91% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 
* This means: 0.91 * 0.95 = 0.865

**Step 3: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours.**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
* The power bank had 0.865 of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 0.865 * 0.93 = 0.80 (approximately) of its capacity remaining after 3 hours.

**Step 4: Calculate the final charge.**

* The power bank had 0.80 of its capacity remaining after 3 hours.
* The power bank had 28% of its capacity remaining at the end.
* We can use the information from Step 3 to find the initial charge. 
* 0.80 = 0.28 * 0.95
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 * 0.95 / 0.80 = 0.34 (approximately)


**Final Answer:** The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **0.34**.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = (5 * 3) / 8
   C = 15/8

3. **Therefore, Colin is currently 15/8 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
* Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* ""Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes"":  b = 3c - 2
* ""Each person gets two treats"":  5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats

**3. Solve for the number of cupcakes (c):**

* We know the total number of treats is 10. 
* Since b = 3c - 2, we can substitute this into the treats equation: 10 = 5 * 2 + (3c - 2)
* Simplify: 10 = 10 + 3c - 2
* Combine like terms: 10 = 8 + 3c
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 2 = 3c
* Divide both sides by 3: c = 2/3

**4.  Since we can't have a fraction of a cupcake, there must be an error in the problem setup.**
