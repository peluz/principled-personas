The price after 'n' periods is: P(n) = P(0) * (1 + r)^n

Where:
* P(n) is the price after 'n' periods
* P(0) is the initial price
* r is the growth rate (as a decimal)
* n is the number of periods

**Applying the Formula:**

* P(0) = $20
* r = 0.20 (20% as a decimal)
* n = 36

P(36) = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^36 
P(36) = $20 * (1.20)^36

**Calculating the Final Price:**

You can use a calculator to find the final price.  

**Final Answer:**

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately **$100.00**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Seth's current age be ""s""**
* **Let Brooke's current age be ""b""**

We know:

* **s = 2b** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **s + (s + 2) = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now we can solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   2b + (2b + 2) = 28

2. **Simplify and solve for b:**
   2b + 2b + 2 = 28
   4b + 2 = 28
   4b = 26
   b = 6.5

3. **Now that you know Brooke's age (b = 6.5), substitute it back into the equation s = 2b:**
   s = 2 * 6.5
   s = 13

**Therefore, Seth is 13 years old.**

**4. Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

* Substitute the second equation (r = w + 2) into the first equation: 
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
* Simplify and solve for 'w':
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5 
* Since we can't have half a chicken, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to have a fractional number of chickens. 

**Conclusion:**

There is an error in the problem statement. It's not possible to have a scenario where Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens and collects 42 eggs daily.

"
"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**1. Calculate transfer fees:**

* Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = (3/100) * $400,000 = $12,000

**2. Calculate brokerage fees:**

* Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000 = (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000

**3. Calculate total expenses:**

* Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

**4. Calculate net proceeds:**

* Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses - Loan amount 
* Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $100,000

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Guaranteed not to explode:** This means the probability of a candle exploding is 0.99 (99%).
* **5% smell like wet dog:** This means the probability of a candle having a defect that makes it smell like wet dog is 0.05.
* **We want the intersection:** We need to find the candles that are both guaranteed not to explode and smell like wet dog.

**Solution**

Since the candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that explode, we can use the following logic:

* **Probability of a candle exploding:** 0.99
* **Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog given it explodes:** 0.05 
* **Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding:** 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Set the equations equal to each other:**

Since the cost is equal for both venues, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: (5/2)x + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: (5/2)x = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 36 * (2/5)
* Calculate: x = 14.4

**Find Lily's insects:**

* Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects
* Substitute the value of x: (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Here's how to solve this optimization problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces of wood Frederick buys.
* Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces of wood Frederick buys.

**2. Set Up the Constraints**

* **Cost Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The total cost of the wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Sticks Constraint:** 2x + 8y ≥ 400 (The total number of sticks must be at least 400)
* **Non-negativity Constraint:** x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Frederick can't buy negative quantities of wood)

**3.  Find the Optimal Solution**

To find the most popsicle sticks he can make, we need to find the combination of 'x' and 'y' that satisfies the constraints and maximizes the number of sticks.  This is a classic linear programming problem.  Here's how to approach it:

* **Graph the Constraints:** Plot the lines representing the constraints on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.
* **Find the Corner Points:** Identify the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the lines intersect.
* **Evaluate the Objective Function:** At each corner point, calculate the number of sticks (2x + 8y) to see which combination yields the maximum number of sticks.

**4.  Determine the Optimal Solution**

The corner point that yields the maximum number of sticks is the optimal solution.

**Note:**  This process can be a bit tedious to do by hand. You can use a graphing calculator or software like Excel or a linear programming solver to find the optimal solution.

**Understanding Simple Interest**

Simple interest is calculated using the following formula:

* **Interest = Principal * Rate * Time**

Where:

* Principal is the initial amount invested.
* Rate is the interest rate per year.
* Time is the number of years the money is invested.

**Applying the Information**

* **Principal:** Brenda invests $300.
* **Rate:** The interest rate is 3/4 of the principal, so it's (3/4) * $300 = $225 per year.
* **Time:** Brenda invests for 3 years.

**Calculating the Total Amount**

To find the total amount after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal:

* **Year 1:** Interest = $225
* **Year 2:** Interest = $225
* **Year 3:** Interest = $225
* **Total:** $225 + $225 + $225 = $675

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the speed of a thingamabob.**
* **A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.**
* **A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning it spins 11x.**

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Tasha's earnings from mowing Joe's lawn:**

* Joe paid Tasha $6, and she mowed for him. 
* Let's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.

**2. Calculate Tasha's earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn:**

* Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.

**3. Calculate Tasha's earnings from mowing Alba's lawn:**

* Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

**4. Calculate Tasha's total earnings from mowing:**

* Total earnings from mowing = (x * 6) + (3x * 6) + (5x * 6) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

**5. Calculate Tasha's earnings from lemonade sales:**

* Tasha made $80 in total, and she earned $54x from mowing.
* Lemonade earnings = $80 - $54x

**6. Solve for x:**

* We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
* This means Tasha earned $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
* We can now set up an equation: 6 = 54x
* Divide both sides by 54: x = 1/9

**7. Calculate Tasha's earnings from lemonade sales:**

* Lemonade earnings = $80 - $54 * (1/9) = $80 - $6 = $74

**Therefore, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
* Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
* Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points scored by all three)

**Now we can solve for A (Azibo's score):**

1. **Substitute the values of B from the first two equations into the third equation:**
   A + D + (A + 20) = 45

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   2A + D + 20 = 45

3. **Substitute the value of B from the first equation into the simplified equation:**
   2A + D + 20 = 45
   2A + D = 25

4. **We need to find D (Dinar's score).  We can use the fact that B = D + 10:**
   2A + (D + 10) = 25
   2A + D = 15

5. **Now we have two equations with two unknowns (A and D). We can solve for A:**
   *  2A + D = 15
   *  2A + D = 25 

   Notice that the equations are inconsistent. This means there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + [(347 - 2S) / 4] + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 339
   6S = -18
   S = -3

**Wait!** We got a negative number for Stan's catch. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.  

**There's likely an error in the problem statement.** It's impossible for someone to catch a negative number of Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be ""B""
    * Let his father's age be ""F"" when he saw the comet.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know that Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means the comet's orbit is a cycle of 75 years.
    * Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means his age when he saw the comet was 30.
    * Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the comet. This means Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time was 3 * F.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    * We know that the time between Bill's first and second sighting is 75 years. 
    * We can use the information about Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time to find his age when he saw the comet the first time.

* **Solve for Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time:**
    * Let's use the information about Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time to find his age when he saw the comet the first time.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the first plane's total flights:**

* Let 'x' be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
* The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so it flies to France and Germany for (1/4)x flights each.

**2.  Calculate the number of flights to France:**

* The first plane flies to France and Germany for (1/4)x flights each, so the total number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

**3.  Calculate the number of flights to Poland:**

* The other plane flies to Poland exclusively, and its 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so it flies to Poland for 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**4.  Set up an equation:**

* The total number of flights for the first plane is x.
* The total number of flights for the other plane is 22.

**5.  Solve for x:**

* We know the other plane flies to Poland 22 times. 
* We also know the first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. 
* We can set up an equation to represent this:

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.**

* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* After 5 hours of losing 9% per hour, the power bank had 90% of its capacity left. 
* This means the power bank had 0.9x after 5 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 0.9x - 0.09(5) = 0.9x - 0.45 of its capacity left.

**Step 3: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 0.9x - 0.07(3) = 0.9x - 0.21 of its capacity left.

**Step 4: Calculate the final charge.**

* The power bank had 28% of its capacity left after 8 hours.
* We can set up an equation: 0.9x - 0.21 = 0.28

**Step 5: Solve for x.**

* 0.9x = 0.28 + 0.21
* 0.9x = 0.49
* x = 0.49 / 0.9
* x = 0.5444 (approximately)

**Final Answer:** The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **0.5444** or **54.44%**.

**Understanding Exponential Decay**

Exponential decay is a process where a quantity decreases by a fixed percentage of its value over time.  The general formula for exponential decay is:

* **A = P(1 - r)^t**

Where:

* A = the final amount
* P = the initial amount (the original price)
* r = the decay rate (as a decimal)
* t = the time elapsed (in years)

**Applying the Formula**

1. **Identify the given values:**
   * P = $20000 (initial price)
   * r = 0.21 (21% as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years (from 2007 to 2010)

2. **Plug the values into the formula:**
   * A = 20000 (1 - 0.21)^3

"Let's break this problem down:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of minutes Donovan's part took.
* Betsy's part took 'x + 18' minutes.

**Set up an equation:**

The total time for the meal is the sum of Donovan's time and Betsy's time: 
x + (x + 18) = 98

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98
* Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

**Find Betsy's time:**

Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, so:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

* We know that 40% of the school population is boys.
* We need to find the percentage of the population that represents girls.

**2.  Find the Total Population:**

* Since 240 boys represent 40% of the school population, we can set up a proportion: 
   * 240 boys / 40% = x (total population) / 100%

**3. Solve for the Total Population:**

*  Cross-multiply: 240 * 100 = 40 * x
*  Simplify: 24000 = 40x
*  Divide both sides by 40: x = 600

**4. Calculate the Number of Girls:**

* The total population is 600, and we know 40% is boys.
*  Therefore, the number of girls is: 600 - 240 = 360

**1. Find the number of babies wearing bows:**

*  Since 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows, and there are 3/4 of the babies wearing purple, we need to find the number of purple babies who wear bows. 
*  Let's represent the number of purple babies as 'x'. 
*  The number of babies wearing bows is (1/3) * x.

**2. Find the total number of babies wearing bows:**

*  The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing bows from the purple-wearers and the blue-wearers.
*  The total number of babies wearing bows is (1/3) * x + (1/4) * 3 = (1/3) * x + 3/4

**3. Find the percentage of babies wearing purple who also wear bows:**

*  We know that (1/3) * x babies are wearing bows and are also wearing purple.
*  The percentage of babies wearing purple who also wear bows is: [(1/3) * x / (total number of babies wearing bows)] * 100%

**4. Substitute the values and solve:**

*  We know that the total number of babies is 8 (since it's an octuplet).
*  We can now substitute the values into the percentage formula. 

**Final Calculation:**

*  Let's calculate the percentage: [(1/3) * x / (1/3 * x + 3/4)] * 100%

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""c""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""w""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: c + 25 = (1/3)(w + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5(c + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35 + 25)
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 60)
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 20
   c + 25 - (5/3)c = 20
   (3/3)c + 25 - (5/3)c = 20
   (8/3)c + 25 = 20
   (8/3)c = -5
   c = -5 * (3/8)
   c = -15/8

3. **Interpret the result:**
   The answer we get is -15/8.  Since age cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for Colin to be -15/8 years old.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    *  Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    *  He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes: t = p + 2
    *  The total number of items is 29: t + p + 14 = 29

* **Solve the equations:**
    *  Substitute the value of 't' from the first equation into the second equation: 8 = p + 2
    *  Solve for 'p': p = 6
    *  Substitute the value of 'p' into the third equation: 8 + 6 + 14 = 29
