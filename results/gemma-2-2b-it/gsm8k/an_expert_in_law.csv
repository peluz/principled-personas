"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's represent the unknown:** 
    * Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

* **Sales at the green house:**
    * Melanie sold (1/3)x vacuum cleaners at the green house.

* **Sales at the red house:**
    * She sold 2 more than the green house, so she sold (1/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.

* **Sales at the orange house:**
    * She sold half of what was left after selling at the green house and the red house, so she sold (1/2) * ((1/3)x + 2) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

* **Total sales:**
    * The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of sales at all three houses: (1/3)x + (1/3)x + 2 + (1/2) * ((1/3)x + 2) = 5

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: (2/3)x + 2 + (1/6)x + 1 = 5
    * Combine like terms: (5/6)x + 3 = 5
    * Subtract 3 from both sides: (5/6)x = 2
    * Multiply both sides by (6/5): x = 2 * (6/5)
    * Calculate: x = 12

**Therefore, Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**2.  Find the Unit Value:**

*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
*  The ratio is 7:13, so we need to find out how many cups of water are represented by 120 teaspoons.

**3.  Set up a Proportion:**

Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water.  We can set up a proportion:

7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

**4. Solve for x:**

* Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
* Simplify: 7x = 1560
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups (approximately)

**5. Calculate the Number of Teaspoonfuls of Sugar:**

* Since the ratio is 7:13, and we know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the number of cups of water by the ratio: 
* 120 teaspoons = (222.86 cups * 7) teaspoons 

**Final Answer:** 
 
 850.32 teaspoons

**1. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago:**

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary now:**

* Adrien's salary now is $40000 * 1.40 (40% increase) = $56000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**

* Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation: 
   * Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30 
   * $40000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30
   * Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.30 = $3077 (approximately)

**4. Calculate Lylah's salary now:**

* Lylah's salary now is $3077 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

**5. Calculate Adrien and Lylah's total salary four years later:**

* Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56000 + $4300 = $60300

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price increases by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months.

**Calculation**

* **Month 1:**  The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. 
   * New price: $20 + $4 = $24
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80
   * New price: $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is $5.76
   * New price: $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is $6.91
   * New price: $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is $8.29
   * New price: $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is $9.95
   * New price: $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is $11.94
   * New price: $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is $14.33
   * New price: $71.65 + $14.33 = $86.98
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $86.98, which is $17.39
   * New price: $86.98 + $17.39 = $104.37
* **Month 10:** The price increases by 20% of $104.37, which is $20.87
   * New price: $104.37 + $20.87 = $125.24
* **Month 11:** The price increases by 20% of $125.24, which is $25.05
   * New price: $125.24 + $25.05 = $150.29
* **Month 12:** The price increases by 20% of $150.29, which is $30.06
   * New price: $150.29 + $30.06 = $180.35
* **Month 13:** The price increases by 20% of $180.35, which is $36.07
   * New price: $180.35 + $36.07 = $216.42
* **Month 14:** The price increases by 20% of $216.42, which is $43.28

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know w = r + 2 (two more white chickens than red)
* We know the total eggs from red and white chickens is 42: 3r + 5w = 42

**3. Substitute to solve for 'r':**

* Since we know w = r + 2, substitute that into the second equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
* Simplify: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42
* Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32
* Divide both sides by 8: r = 4

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool initially had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, meaning they lost a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * We know the big pool has 8x gallons and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We also know that the big pool had twice the water of the small pool initially. 

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = 2(x - 16)
    * 8x = 2x - 32
    * 6x = 32
    * x = 32/6

**Understanding the Problem**

* The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
* We need to find the time it takes to reach 100% charge.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate the charge needed:**  To go from 60% to 100%, the phone needs to gain 40% of charge (100% - 60% = 40%).

2. **Determine the time:**  Since the phone charges at 1% per 3 minutes, we need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to gain 40%.

   *  40% charge / (1% charge per 3 minutes) = 40 minutes 
   *  Total time = 40 minutes / (1% charge per 3 minutes) = 120 minutes

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We know that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers.
* We know that 20 students don't have desktop computers.

**2.  Find the Total Number of Students:**

* Let 'x' represent the total number of students.
*  The fraction of students with computers is 3/4, so: (3/4) * x = students with computers
*  The students without computers are the remaining students: x - 20 = students without computers
*  We can now set up an equation: (3/4) * x = x - 20

**3. Solve for x:**

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 4: 3x = 4x - 80
* Subtract 3x from both sides: 0 = x - 80
* Add 80 to both sides: 80 = x

**Answer:** There are **80** students at that grade level.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects. 


**Important Note:**  Since you can't have a fraction of an insect, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Lily found approximately **14** insects.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are '0.99b' red jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are '1.01b' green jelly beans.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 
b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**Find the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01b = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99b = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

**Answer:** There are 1515 - 1495 = **20** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = fragrance (same amount as zest)
    *  y = salt (same amount as sugar)
    *  z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
    *  z = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)
    *  z = 2 * x 

* **Solve for the amount of oil (z):**
    *  Since z = 2x and z = 2 * x, we can substitute to find z. 
    *  z = 2 * x 
    *  z = 2 * x 

* **We know the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces:**
    *  x + y + z + fragrance = 10 ounces
    *  x + y + z + x = 10 ounces
    *  2x + y + z = 10 ounces

* **Substitute the value of z:**
    *  2x + y + 2x = 10 ounces
    *  4x + y = 10 ounces

* **We know that y = salt and x = zest:**
    *  4x + y = 10 ounces
    *  4x + x = 10 ounces
    *  5x = 10 ounces
    *  x = 2 ounces

* **Calculate the amount of oil (z):**
    *  z = 2x
    *  z = 2 * 2 ounces
    *  z = 4 ounces

**Answer:** Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* A + S + W = 339 (They have a total of 339 Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Combine** like terms:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the above equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40 

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the equation for S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know that 95% of x is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.95x = 0.28 
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.95 = 0.294 (approximately)

**2. Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
    * Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

* **Set up an equation:**

    * The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.
    * The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x.
    * The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120.  So, 12x + 8x = $120

**Understanding Proportional Pricing**

When prices are proportional, it means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is the same for all packages. 

* **Step 1: Find the price per sandwich for the first package.**
   The first package has 2 sandwiches at $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

* **Step 2:  Find the price per sandwich for the second package.**
   The second package has 4 sandwiches at $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

* **Step 3:  Determine the price per sandwich for the third package.**
   Since the prices are proportional, the third package should also have a price per sandwich of $1.50.

* **Step 4: Calculate the cost of the third package.**
   The third package has 8 sandwiches at $1.50 per sandwich, so the total cost is 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  Total eggs painted: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for 'y' (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

**4. Substitute the value of 'y' into the equation for Camden and Sarah's eggs:**

* Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
* Camden painted (22 - x) + 12 = 34 - x

**5.  Solve for 'x' (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

* We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.
* 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the speed on the sidewalk:**

* Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, and at twice the speed of the beach, so she covers 2 miles in the same time.
* Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach

**2. Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**

* Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
* Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2 * Speed on the beach)

**3. Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

* Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
* Total time = 40 minutes + (1 mile / (2 * Speed on the beach)) * Time on beach

**4. Simplify and solve for the time:**

* Since the time on the beach is 40 minutes, we can substitute that into the equation.
* Total time = 40 minutes + (1 mile / (2 * Speed on the beach)) * 40 minutes

**5.  We need to find the speed on the beach to solve for the total time.**

* We know Grandma walks 3 miles in total, and 2 miles are on the beach.
* Time on the beach = 2 miles / Speed on the beach
* Total time = 3 miles / Speed on the beach

**6. Substitute the time on the beach into the equation from step 4:**

* Total time = 3 miles / Speed on the beach + (1 mile / (2 * Speed on the beach)) * 40 minutes

**7. Simplify and solve for the total time:**

* Total time = 3 miles / Speed on the beach + 20 minutes / Speed on the beach

**8.  We can't solve for the total time without knowing the speed on the beach.** 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact time it takes Grandma to complete the entire walk without knowing the speed on the beach.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out how much Rissa started with:**

* Rissa was given thrice the amount Ronnie received, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

**2. Determine how much Rissa gave to her sister:**

* Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, meaning she gave away (1 - 4/5) = 1/5 of her money.
*  Let 'x' be the amount Rissa gave to her sister.  We know: 15 - x = (1/5) * 15

**3. Solve for x:**

* Simplify the equation: 15 - x = 3
* Subtract 15 from both sides: -x = -12
* Multiply both sides by -1: x = 12

**4. Calculate how much Rissa has left:**

* Rissa gave away $12, so she has 15 - 12 = $3 left.

**5. Calculate how much Ronnie has left:**

* Ronnie gave away the same amount as Rissa, so he also gave away $12.
* Ronnie has $5 - $12 = -$7. 

**Final Answer:**  Ronnie has -$7 left. 


**Important Note:**  The answer is negative because the problem states that Ronnie has a negative amount of money. This is a bit of a trick question, as it's likely there's an error in the problem statement.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = 15/8

3. **Therefore, Colin is currently 15/8 years old.**

**Final answer:** 15/8

**Set up the equations:**

* **Equation 1 (Total animals):** c + w = 20 
* **Equation 2 (Total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':**  w = 20 - c
2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
