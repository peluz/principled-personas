"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so his time was 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:** Gerald's improved time is now 'x + 0.10x' (10% faster).
* **Set up the equation:** We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation: 
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is x + 0.10x = 36 + 0.10(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**2.  Find the Unit Value:**

*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar. 
*  Let's figure out how many cups of water she used for that amount of sugar. 
*  We can use the ratio to find this.  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up a proportion: 
   * (7/13) = (x/120)  (where x is the number of cups of water)

**3. Solve for x:**

* Cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 13 * x
* Simplify: 840 = 13x
* Divide both sides by 13: x = 64.62 (approximately)

**4. Calculate the Number of Teaspoonfuls of Sugar:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'q' represent the number of queens.
   * Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = 2b (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
   * We know b = 2q (twice as many babies as queens)

* **Substitute to find the number of worker bees:**
   * Since b = 2q, we can substitute that into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q 

* **Solve for the number of worker bees:**
   * We know there are 700 bees in total.  
   * So, q (queens) + b (baby bees) + w (worker bees) = 700
   * q + 2q + 4q = 700
   * 7q = 700
   * q = 100

"Let's break down this word problem:

* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by ""B""**
* **Let Seth's current age be represented by ""S""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Since Brooke's age is a whole number, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume Brooke is 8 years old.

Now we can find Seth's age:

* **S = 2B** 
* **S = 2 * 8**
* **S = 16**

**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent the starting floor as ""x"".**
* **The problem states:**  ""4 times his starting floor plus 6"" 
* **This translates to:** 4x + 6
* **We know this equals the floor Bill is on:** 4x + 6 = Bill's current floor

**To find Bill's current floor, we need to solve for x:**

1. **Subtract 6 from both sides:** 4x = Bill's current floor
2. **Divide both sides by 4:** x = Bill's current floor

**Therefore, Bill is on the floor 4x + 6 = 4(3) + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.**

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Sam's current age be represented by the variable ""S""
* Let Ruby's current age be represented by the variable ""R""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam""  This translates to: R = 6S
*  ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"" This translates to: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** Since we know R = 6S, we can substitute that into the second equation:
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Noah's current age:**

* Cera is 46 years old, and six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so we can set up the equation: 3000 * Noah's age = population of Chile six years ago.
* We know the population of Chile six years ago was half the current population, so we can write: 3000 * Noah's age = (current population of Chile) / 2

**2. Find Noah's age six years ago:**

* We know Cera was 40 years old six years ago, and Noah was half her age, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

**3. Calculate the current population of Chile:**

* We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 20 years old.
* Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000 people.
* The current population of Chile is double the population six years ago, so it is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 people.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 5x/2 = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 210
3. Divide both sides by 5: x = 42

**Therefore, there are 42 players on the defense.**

* Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""x"".
* Twice Carver's son's age is 2x.
* Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so he is 2x - 5 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**

* The second city to the third city is 100 miles.
* The third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

**2. Calculate the total distance of the trip:**

* The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

**3. Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:**

* The train makes 3 trips a day, so it travels 225 * 3 = 675 miles in a day.

**4. Calculate the number of days between services:**

* The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
* Divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

**5. Round to the nearest whole number:**

* Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, the answer is **27 days**.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
* The house costs three times the lot, so the house costs 3x.
* The total cost is the sum of the house and lot: x + 3x = $120,000

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, the number of red jelly beans is 0.9b.
* Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01b.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 
b + 0.9b + 1.01b = 4500

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 2.9b = 4500

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *s* represent the number of sheep
*  *g* represent the number of geese

**We know:**

* **Equation 1 (Total legs):** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2 (Total heads):** s + g = 20

**Now we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep):**

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':** 
   g = 20 - s

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:**
   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we need to find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 40% of the water = 0.40
   * 0.40 * (total water) = amount used by the city

* **Step 2: Find the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   If 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 80% of the water used by the city = 0.80
   * 0.80 * (amount used by the city) = amount used for industrial purposes

* **Step 3: Find the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the amount used for industrial purposes from the total amount used by the city.
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = total amount used - amount used for industrial purposes
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = 0.40 * (total water) - 0.80 * (amount used by the city)

* **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can divide the amount used for non-industrial purposes by the total amount used by the city and multiply by 100%.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Anthony's savings:** Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, who saved $20.00, so Anthony saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

2. **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, who saved $30.00.  To find Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of $30.00: 
   * 40/100 * $30.00 = $12.00
   * Roy saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

**Therefore, Roy has $42.00.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:** Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. So Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches. So Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches. So Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the speed of a kangaroo:**

* Since they travel 18 hours and the total distance is the same, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 
* Let 'x' be the speed of a kangaroo.
*  Distance = x * 18 hours

**2. Find the speed of a turtle:**

* The turtles are traveling half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is x/2.

**3. Calculate the time for the turtles:**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = (x * 18 hours) / (x/2) 
* Time = 36 hours

**Answer:** 36 hours

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let my brother's age be ""B""
* Let my age be ""L""
* Let my sister's age be ""S""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* ""I am three years younger than my brother"":  L = B - 3
* ""I am 2 years older than my sister"": L = S + 2
* ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age"": Mom's age = 3B - 1

**Now we can use the fact that the sum of our ages is 87:**

* L + B + S = 87

**Solve for our variables:**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   (B - 3) + B + (S + 2) = 87

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2B + S - 1 = 87

3. **Substitute** the first equation (L = B - 3) into the simplified equation:
   2(B - 3) + S - 1 = 87

4. **Simplify** and solve for B:
   2B - 6 + S - 1 = 87
   2B + S - 7 = 87
   2B + S = 94

5. **Substitute** the second equation (L = S + 2) into the equation we just solved:
   2B + (S + 2) = 94

6. **Simplify** and solve for S:
   2B + S + 2 = 94
   S = 92 - 2B

7. **Substitute** the value of S back into the equation B + S = 94:
   B + (92 - 2B) = 94
   -B + 92 = 94
   -B = 2
   B = -2  (This doesn't make sense, as age cannot be negative)

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
   * Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
   * Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
   * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
   * A + D + B = 45 (The total points for the team)

* **Solve for A (Azibo's score):**
   * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to find A:
      * D + 10 = A + 20
      * A = D - 10 
   * Now, substitute this value of A back into the equation A + D + B = 45:
      * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45
      * 3D + 10 = 45

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 1356
   6S = 1019
   S = 169.83

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's go back and see if our assumptions are correct.**

* **Alex:**  A = S + 5 = 169.83 + 5 = 174.83 (This is not a whole number, so we need to adjust our approach)
* **Adelwolfe:** W = (347 - 2S) / 4 = (347 - 2 * 169.83) / 4 = 49.83 (Again, not a whole number)

**It seems like there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to have a whole number of Pokemon caught with these conditions.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the average age:**

* The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4 
* Since the total age is 20 and there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the size of a kid's slice:**  Let's assume a kid gets a slice of size 'x'.
* **Calculate the size of an adult's slice:** An adult gets a slice twice the size of a kid's, so they get 2 * x.
* **Calculate the total slices:** The family has 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are 2 + 4 = 6 slices in total.
* **Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:**  Each adult gets 2 * x slices, and the total slices are 6.  So, each adult gets (2 * x) / 6 = (x/3) slices. 
* **Express the answer as a percentage:**  To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (x/3) * 100 = (100x/3)%.

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it lost 9% * 5 hours = 45% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%

**Step 2: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**

* The power bank lost 7% of its charge for 3 hours, so it lost 7% * 3 hours = 21% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 8 hours is 100% - 21% = 79%

**Step 3: Calculate the initial charge.**

* The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.
* We can use the following equation to find the initial charge: 28% = (Initial Charge) * (1 - 7% * 8 hours)
* Solving for the initial charge, we get: Initial Charge = 28% / (1 - 7% * 8 hours)

**Step 4: Calculate the initial charge.**

*  We can use the equation above to find the initial charge. 

**Final Answer:** 
 
Please note that the calculation for the initial charge is a bit complex and requires a calculator.

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have half a ball, there must be an error in the problem statement.** 


**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**First Half:**

* Team A scores 4 goals.
* Team B scores 2 fewer goals than A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

**Second Half:**

* Team B scores 4 times the number of goals from the first half, so they score 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scores 1/4 of what Team B scores, so they score 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

**Total Goals:**

* Total goals for Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
* Total goals for Team B: 2 + 8 = 10 goals
* Total goals for the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   (3/3)C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   (8/3)C + 25 = 20
   (8/3)C = -5
   C = -5 * (3/8)
   C = -15/8

3. **The answer:**

   Colin is currently -15/8 years old. 

**Important Note:**  Age cannot be negative. This means there's likely an error in the problem statement.  It's impossible for Colin to be -15/8 years old.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim:** This means Jim was John's age divided by 2.
* **John is 28 now:**  We know John's age now.
* **To find Jim's age, we need to figure out how old he was when Digimon came out.**

Let's use algebra to solve this:

* Let Jim's age when Digimon came out be represented by the variable ""x"".
* We know John was twice as old as Jim, so John's age at that time was 2x.
* We also know John is 28 now, so 2x = 28.

Now, solve for x:

* Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14

**Therefore, Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
   *  S = 27 - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
   * Since S = K + 8 and S = 27 - 12, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
     * K + 8 = 27 - 12
     * K + 8 = 15
     * K = 15 - 8
     * K = 7

**Therefore, Kim has 7 paintings.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
