"This is a bit of a trick question!  

The question asks about profit, but the merchant's favorite color (blue) has no bearing on the financial decision.  

To calculate the profit, we need to know the actual prices of the jewelry and electronic gadgets after the market fluctuations. 

**Here's how to calculate the profit:**

1. **Calculate the price increase for each item:**
   * Jewelry: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
   * Electronic Gadgets: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

2. **Calculate the new prices:**
   * Jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   * Electronic Gadgets: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

3. **Determine the profit:**
   * Profit = New Price - Original Price
   * Profit (Jewelry) = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
   * Profit (Electronic Gadgets) = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

**Therefore, the profit would be $125 for the jewelry and $96 for the electronic gadgets.**

*  The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.
*  To find the number of cups, we can set up a proportion: 
   *  (7/13) = (x/120)  (where x is the number of cups)
*  Cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 13 * x
*  Simplify: 840 = 13x
*  Solve for x: x = 840 / 13 = 64.62 (approximately)

**4.  Find the Number of Teaspoons:**

*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar. 
*  We already calculated that she used 64.62 cups of water.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'q' represent the number of queens.
   * Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * b = q  (There are twice as many babies as queens)
   * w = 2b  (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
   * w = 2 * (q) (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

* **Solve for the number of worker bees (w):**
   * Since b = q, we can substitute that into the equation w = 2b: w = 2 * q
   * We know there are 700 bees in total, so: 700 = q + 2q + 2q
   * Combine like terms: 700 = 5q
   * Solve for q: q = 700 / 5 = 140 queens

* **Calculate the number of worker bees:**

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Noah's current age:**

* Cera is 46 years old, and six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so we can set up the equation: 3000 * Noah's age = population of Chile six years ago.
* We know the population of Chile six years ago was half the current population, so we can write: 3000 * Noah's age = (current population of Chile) / 2

**2. Find Noah's age six years ago:**

* We know Cera was 40 years old six years ago, and Noah was half her age, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

**3. Calculate the current population of Chile:**

* We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 20 years old.
* Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000 people.
* The current population of Chile is double the population six years ago, so it is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 people.

* We know that c + w = 60 (total number of animals)
* We also know that c = 2w (twice as many chickens as cows)

**3. Solve for the number of cows (w):**

* Since c = 2w, substitute this into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
* Combine like terms: 3w = 60

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.01b fewer red jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 0.01b more green jelly beans.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:
b + (0.01b) + (0.01b) = 4500

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine the 'b' terms: 1.02b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 1.02: b = 4444.44 (approximately)

**Find the difference in green and red:**

* Since there are 0.01b more green jelly beans than blue, there are 0.01 * 4444.44 = 44.44 more green jelly beans.

"I don't have personal preferences like a favorite color.  

To solve the age problem, we need to figure out Jerry's current age and then add 3 years to it. 

Here's how:

* **Let's say Jerry's current age is ""x"".**
* **Five years ago, he was ""x-5"".**
* **We know Jerry is twice as old now as he was five years ago:**  x = 2(x - 5)

Now we can solve for x:

* x = 2x - 10

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  ""She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance""  => x = fragrance
    *  ""She uses twice as much oil as salt"" => oil = 2y
    *  ""She uses twice as much salt as zest"" => salt = 2x

* **Now we can express the amount of oil in terms of x:**
    *  oil = 2y 
    *  Since salt = 2x, we can substitute 2x for salt in the oil equation: oil = 2 * (2x) = 4x

* **We know the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces:**
    *  Salt + Zest + Fragrance + Oil + Sugar = 10 ounces
    *  Since we know salt = 2x and zest = x, we can substitute: x + x + x + 4x + Sugar = 10 ounces
    *  Combine like terms: 7x + Sugar = 10 ounces

* **We need to find the value of x (zest) to find the amount of oil.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
   * Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
   * Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
   * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
   * A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

* **Solve for A (Azibo's score):**
   * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to find A:
      * D + 10 = A + 20
      * A = D - 10 
   * Now, substitute this value of A back into the equation A + D + B = 45:
      * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45
      * 3D + 10 = 45
      * 3D = 35
      * D = 11.67 (We'll round this to 12 for simplicity)

* **Find Azibo's score (A):**
   * A = D - 10
   * A = 12 - 10
   * A = 2

**Therefore, Azibo scored 2 points.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **S = A + 5** (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* **A = 4W - 13** (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
* **A + S + W = 339** (Total Pokemon caught)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch (A):**

1. **Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:**
   (4W - 13) + (A + 5) + W = 339

2. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   5W - 8 = 339
   5W = 347
   W = 69.4

3. **Substitute the value of W back into the equation for A:**
   A = 4(69.4) - 13
   A = 277.6 - 13
   A = 264.6

4. **Substitute the value of A back into the equation for S:**
   S = 264.6 + 5
   S = 269.6

5. **Now that we know A and S, we can find Stan's catch:**
   A = Stan's catch 
   Stan caught **264.6** Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.**  Let's assume the power bank had a full charge of 100%. 
* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours.** The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.  
* **Step 3: Calculate the remaining charge after the first 5 hours.** The power bank had 100% - 45% = 55% of its charge remaining.
* **Step 4: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours.** The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **Step 5: Calculate the remaining charge after the next 3 hours.** The power bank had 55% - 21% = 34% of its charge remaining.
* **Step 6: Calculate the initial charge.** The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining, so we can use this to calculate the initial charge. 

**Let's use a bit of algebra to solve for the initial charge:**

* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* The power bank lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours, so the remaining charge after 5 hours is 0.55x.
* The power bank lost 21% of its charge in the next 3 hours, so the remaining charge after 8 hours is 0.34x.
* We know the remaining charge after 8 hours is 28%, so we can set up an equation: 0.34x = 0.28 
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.34 = 0.82 (approximately)

**Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 82%.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

**Find the length of the red rope:**

* Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

**3. Find how much money Rissa had before giving any away:**

* Rissa had $15 and gave away $9, so she had $15 - $9 = $6 left.

**4. Find how much money Ronnie had before giving any away:**

* Rissa had $6, and she gave away $9, so Ronnie had $15 - $9 = $6.

**5. Find how much money Ronnie has left:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be ""c""
* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: c + 25 = (1/3)(w + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), substitute that into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5(c + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35 + 25)
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 60)
   c + 25 = (5c/3) + 20
   (3c + 75) = 5c + 60
   3c - 5c = 60 - 75
   -2c = -15
   c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**
