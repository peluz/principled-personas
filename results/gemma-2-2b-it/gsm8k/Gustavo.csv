"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Green House:** Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house than the green house.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of what was left after selling at the green house and the red house.

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

**Set up the equations:**

*  x - (1/3)x = 5 (The number of vacuum cleaners left)
*  x - (1/3)x + 2 = 5 (The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house and red house)
*  (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5 (The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house)

"This is a bit of a trick question!  

Here's why:

* **We need to know the merchant's starting point.**  The question only tells us the value of the items and the expected percentage increases.  We don't know how much the merchant is buying for or how much they're hoping to make. 

To calculate profit, we need to know:

* **The price the merchant pays for each item.**
* **The merchant's desired profit margin.**

**Without this information, we can't determine the profit.**

"Let's break down each friend's guess:

* **Friend 1:** 80 jelly beans
* **Friend 2:** Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* **Friend 3:** 25% of 80 is (25/100) * 80 = 20 jelly beans.  25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now let's find the average:

(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = (240) / 3 = 80

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.**

* **Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so she has x + 30 gold coins.**

* **The total number of coins is 110, so x + (x + 30) = 110**

* **Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110**

* **Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80**

* **Divide both sides by 2: x = 40**

* **Gretchen has 40 silver coins.**

* **Gretchen has x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Dana's running speed:**

* Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her running speed is 4 * her walking speed.

**2. Dana's walking speed:**

* Dana skips at half the speed of her running, so her walking speed is 1 / 2 * her running speed.

**3. Dana's running time:**

* She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.

**4. Dana's walking time:**

* She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

**5. Distance traveled by running:**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance (running) = 4 * her walking speed * 2 hours = 8 * her walking speed

**6. Distance traveled by walking:**

* Distance (walking) = her walking speed * 4 hours = 4 * her walking speed

**7. Total distance:**

* Total distance = Distance (running) + Distance (walking)
* Total distance = 8 * her walking speed + 4 * her walking speed
* Total distance = 12 * her walking speed

**8. Substituting Dana's walking speed:**

* Since Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, her walking speed is 3 miles per hour.
* Total distance = 12 * 3 miles per hour = 36 miles

**Answer:** 36 miles

* **Total pension:** We need to calculate the total amount she receives from the pension.

**Here's how to calculate the total pension:**

1. **Calculate the total pension from the initial 40 years:** 
   * $50,000/year * 40 years = $2,000,000

2. **Calculate the total pension from the 10 years of the 5% annual pension:**
   * $50,000/year * 0.05 * 10 years = $2,500

3. **Add the two amounts together:**
   * $2,000,000 + $2,500 = $2,002,500

**Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $2,002,500.** 


**Final answer: $2,002,500**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time was 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:** Gerald's improved time is now 'x + 0.1x' (10% improvement on his original time).
* **Set up the equation:** We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation: 
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Calculate Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is 'x + 0.1x' = 36 + 0.1 * 36 = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

* **Locsin's seahorses:** Anakin caught 6 seahorses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.
* **Locsin's clownfish:** Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Step 1: Calculate the price increase after 2 months.** 
   20% of $20 is (20/100) * $20 = $4.
   The price increases to $20 + $4 = $24.

* **Step 2: Calculate the price after 4 months.**
   The price increases again by 20% of $24, which is (20/100) * $24 = $4.80.
   The price is now $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

* **Step 3: Continue this pattern for 36 months.**
   You'll need to repeat the process of calculating the price increase for each two-month period.  

**It's easier to use a calculator or spreadsheet to do this calculation.**  

**Here's a way to do it with a spreadsheet:**

* **Column A:** Months (1, 2, 3, ... 36)
* **Column B:** Price (Start with $20, then calculate the price increase for each month)

You can use a formula to calculate the price for each month. 

**The final price after 36 months will be approximately $100.80**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Brooke's current age be ""B""**
* **Let Seth's current age be ""S""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Since Brooke's age is a whole number, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume Brooke is 8 years old.

Now we can find Seth's age:

* **S = 2B** 
* **S = 2 * 8**
* **S = 16**

**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Distance from third to first:** The train travels 50 miles less than the combined distance from the second to the third city, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Total distance for one trip:** The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.
* **Total distance for 3 trips:** The total distance for 3 trips is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.
* **Days for service:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it needs service after 18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days. 

**Therefore, the train needs service every 27 days.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the average stuffing for a collie bed:**

* The average of 2 pounds (chihuahua) and 8 pounds (Rottweiler) is (2 + 8) / 2 = 5 pounds.

**2. Calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds:**

* 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds

**3. Calculate the total stuffing for the collie beds:**

* 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds

**4. Calculate the total stuffing needed:**

* 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds

**Answer:** 23

"Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the time to reach the friend's house:**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)

**2. Calculate the time for the detour:**

* Distance: 10 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours (approximately)

**3. Calculate the time to return home:**

* Distance: 240 miles
* Speed: 80 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**4. Calculate the total time:**

* Time to reach friend's house: 2.86 hours
* Time for detour: 0.14 hours
* Time to return home: 3 hours
* Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 6.10 hours (approximately)

**Final answer: 6.10 hours**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the number of boys:** There are 96 total students, and 43 are girls, so there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.
* **Subtract the absent boys:** 5 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 5 = 48 boys at school on Friday.

**Answer:** 48 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's figure out how many boys there are:** Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 6 girls * 2 = 12 boys.
* **Total kids:**  There are 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids in the park.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 customers were kicked out for mask refusal, and this is represented by ""3 * 4 - 5""
* **Shoplifting:**  The number of shoplifters is ""3 * (4 * 3 - 5)""
* **Physical Violence:** The number of people kicked out for physical violence is ""3 * (4 * 3 - 5)""

**Let's calculate:**

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 * 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
* **Shoplifting:** 3 * (4 * 3 - 5) = 3 * (12 - 5) = 3 * 7 = 21

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:** Joanne gathers half the number of apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We know Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, and we need to find how many she gathered.
* **Joanne's total apples:** Joanne gathers 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.
* **Sister's apples from tallest trees:** Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Total apples gathered by the sisters:** The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, so we can set up an equation: 45 + 60 + x = 500, where x is the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
* **Solving for x:**  Combining like terms, we get 105 + x = 500. Subtracting 105 from both sides, we get x = 395.

**Therefore, Joanne gathered 395 apples from the average trees.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the price of the jogger jeans:**

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28.
* Jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

**2. Calculate the total cost of the jeans:**

* Cole bought both pairs of jeans, so the total cost was $28 + $22 = $50.

**3. Calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:**

* Cole saved $6 in total.
* He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is (1/3) * $22 = $7.33 (rounded to the nearest cent).

**4. Calculate the savings from the tattered jeans:**

* Cole saved $6 in total, and $7.33 from the jogger jeans.
* He saved $6 - $7.33 = -$1.33. This means he actually spent more than he saved.

**5. Determine the original price difference:**

* The problem states that Cole saved $6 in total. 
* The problem also states that he spent more than he saved. 
* This means that the jogger jeans originally cost more than the tattered jeans. 


**Final Answer:**  The jogger jeans originally cost more than the tattered jeans.

"Let's break down the costs for each venue:

**Venue 1:**

* Flat fee: $200
* Food cost: $5 per person * x guests = $5x
* Total cost: $200 + $5x

**Venue 2:**

* Cost per person: $25
* Number of guests: x
* Total cost: $25x

**Setting the cost equal:**

We want to find the number of guests (x) where the cost of Venue 1 equals the cost of Venue 2:

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solving for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

**Answer:** 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, the number of red jelly beans is 0.9b.
* Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01b.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 
b + 0.9b + 1.01b = 4500

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 2.9b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.9: b = 1542 (approximately)

**Find the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01b = 1.01 * 1542 = 1557 (approximately)
* Red jelly beans: 0.9b = 0.9 * 1542 = 1389 (approximately)
* Difference: 1557 - 1389 = 168

"Let's break this down:

* **Let Jerry's current age be ""x"".**

* **Five years ago, Jerry was ""x-5"" years old.**

* **The problem states: ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.""**  This translates to the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

* **Now we can solve for x:**
    * x = 2x - 10
    * x - 2x = -10
    * -x = -10
    * x = 10

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  *s* represent the number of sheep
*  *g* represent the number of geese

**We know:**

* **Equation 1 (Total legs):** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we need to find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 40% of the water = 0.40
   * 0.40 * (total water) = amount used by the city

* **Step 2: Find the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   If 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 80% of the water used by the city = 0.80
   * 0.80 * (amount used by the city) = amount used for industrial purposes

* **Step 3: Find the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the amount used for industrial purposes from the total amount used by the city.
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = total amount used - amount used for industrial purposes
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = 0.40 * (total water) - 0.80 * (amount used by the city)

* **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can divide the amount used for non-industrial purposes by the total amount used by the city and multiply by 100%.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house.
    * The first house needs 1/2 of the second, so it needs x/2 cases.
    * The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

* **Total cases:** The total number of cases needed is 250.  We can set up an equation: 
    * x + x/2 + x = 250

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: (5/2)x + x = 250
    * Simplify: (7/2)x = 250

* **Floral shirts with buttons:** 20 floral shirts have buttons.
* **White shirts without collars:**  We know there are 40 white shirts, and half have collars, so there are 40 - 20 = 20 shirts without collars.
* **Floral shirts without buttons:** We need to find the number of floral shirts without buttons. 
* **Difference:**  To find the difference, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let my age be represented by ""x""
* My brother's age is ""x + 3"" (3 years younger than me)
* My sister's age is ""x - 3"" (2 years younger than me)

**Set up an equation based on the given information:**

* Mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1"" (one less than three times my brother's age)

**Now, we know the sum of our ages is 87:**

* x + (x + 3) + (x - 3) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: 4x + 3 + 3x - 3 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
2. Simplify: 10x + 9 = 87
3. Subtract 9 from both sides: 10x = 78
4. Divide both sides by 10: x = 7.8

**Find your age:**

* Since we're dealing with ages, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, you are 7 years old.**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let John's age be represented by ""J"".**
* **Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is ""J + 10"".**
* **Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"".**
* **The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so J + (J + 10) + Jean's age = 100**

We don't have Jean's age, but we can use the information given to find Peter's age. 

**Here's how:**

1. **Combine the ages:**  J + (J + 10) + Jean's age = 100
2. **Simplify:** 2J + 10 + Jean's age = 100
3. **Isolate Jean's age:** Jean's age = 100 - 2J - 10

"Let's break down the information:

* **Deanna is 26:** This is our starting point.
* **Marcus is half of Leo's age:**  This means Marcus's age is half of Leo's age.
* **Marcus is five years younger than Deanna:** This means Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

**Now we can find Leo's age:**

* **Marcus is half of Leo's age:**  Let's say Leo's age is represented by the variable ""L"". So, Marcus's age is L/2.
* **Marcus is five years younger than Deanna:**  We know Marcus is 21 years old, and Deanna is 26. Therefore, L/2 = 21.
* **Solve for L:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: L = 21 * 2 = 42.

    * A + D + B = 45 (The total points for the team)

* **Solve for A (Azibo's score):**
    * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to find A:
        * D + 10 = A + 20
        * A = D - 10 
    * Now, substitute this value of A back into the equation for B:
        * B = D - 10 + 20
        * B = D + 10
    * We know B = 45, so:
        * D + 10 = 45
        * D = 35
    * Now that we know D, we can find A:
        * A = D - 10
        * A = 35 - 10
        * A = 25

**Therefore, Azibo scored 25 points.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 1356
   6S = 1009
   S = 168.17 

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's go back and see if our calculations are consistent with the given information.**

* Alex has caught S + 5 = 168.17 + 5 = 173.17 Pokemon.
* Stan has caught S = 168.17 Pokemon.
* Adelwolfe has caught W = (347 - 2S) / 4 = (347 - 2 * 168.17) / 4 = 40.8 Pokemon.

**The answer is 168.17 Pokemon.  However, we need to round to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Stan has caught 168 Pokemon.**

2. **Oranges remaining:** She started with 12 boxes and gave away 4 boxes, leaving her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes of oranges.

3. **Oranges kept:** She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 boxes of oranges.

4. **Oranges sold:**  She had 8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes of oranges left to sell.

5. **Total oranges sold:**  She sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Richard's cherries:** Let's say Richard has 'x' cherries.
* **Robert's cherries:** Robert has 10 more than Richard, so he has x + 10 cherries.
* **Total cherries:** Together they have 60 cherries: x + (x + 10) + Jerry's cherries = 60
* **Jerry's cherries:** We need to find Jerry's cherries.

**Let's solve for x:**

* x + x + 10 + Jerry's cherries = 60
* 2x + 10 + Jerry's cherries = 60
* 2x + Jerry's cherries = 50
* 2x = 50 - Jerry's cherries

**Now, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:**

* Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 10 + x - Jerry's cherries
* Since we know 2x = 50 - Jerry's cherries, we can substitute: (10 + x) - Jerry's cherries = 10 + x - (50 - x)
* Simplify: 10 + x - Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
* 10 + x - Jerry's cherries = 10
* 10 + x = 10 + Jerry's cherries
* x = Jerry's cherries

**Therefore, Robert has the same number of cherries as Jerry.**

"Okay, let's break down the problem:

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cools 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
* **High setting:** The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it cools 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
* **Total cooling:** The air conditioner cools the room a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Room temperature:** The room was 2 degrees warmer without the air conditioner, so it was 2 degrees warmer after the air conditioner was on for 3 hours.
* **Final temperature:** The room was 18 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:** 18

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time be 'x'.**
* **Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.**
* **Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time was three times his father's age when he saw the comet.**

**Let's use the information to set up an equation:**

*  x = 3 * 30 
*  x = 90

**Now we know Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old.**

**To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to consider the time it takes for the comet to orbit the sun.**

* **Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.**

**Therefore, Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years.  **

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **First plane:**
    *  It flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
    *  The remaining flights are split between France and Germany.
    *  Let's say the first plane makes 'x' flights in a day. 
    *  Since the other plane makes half the number of trips, the first plane makes 2x trips.

* **Second plane:**
    *  It flies exclusively to Poland.
    *  It makes 44 trips.

**Let's use variables to make things easier:**

* Let 'y' represent the number of flights to France.
* The first plane makes 'x' flights in a day.
* The second plane makes 44 trips.

**Now we can set up an equation:**

* The first plane's flights to France: y
* The first plane's flights to Greece: (3/4)x
* The first plane's flights to France and Greece: y + (3/4)x

**We know the total number of flights is:**

* The first plane's flights: x
* The second plane's flights: 44

**Therefore, we can write the equation:**

* x + 44 = y + (3/4)x

**Solving for y:**

* (1/4)x = y
* y = (1/4)x

**We know the first plane makes 2x trips, so:**

* 2x = 44

**Solving for x:**

* x = 22

**Finally, we can find the number of flights to France:**

* y = (1/4)x
* y = (1/4) * 22
* y = 5.5

**Therefore, the first plane takes 5.5 flights to France in one day.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it lost 9% * 5 hours = 45% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%

**Step 2: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**

* The power bank lost 7% of its charge for 3 hours, so it lost 7% * 3 hours = 21% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%

**Step 3: Calculate the initial charge.**

* The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.
* We can use the following equation to find the initial charge: 28% = (Initial Charge) * (1 - 7%) * (1 - 7%) 
* Solving for the initial charge, we get: Initial Charge = 28% / (1 - 7%) * (1 - 7%) = 28% / 0.93 * 0.93 = 28%

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

"Here's how to break down the probabilities:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher)
* **Probability of extension with normal teacher:** 40%
* **Probability of extension with Marcus's dog story:** 20%

To get the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario and add them together:

* **No homework, no extension:** 50% * 100% = 50%
* **No homework, extension:** 50% * 40% = 20%
* **Homework, no extension:** 50% * 100% = 50%
* **Homework, extension:** 50% * 20% = 10%

**Total probability of having to turn in homework:** 50% + 20% + 50% + 10% = **120%**

"Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Second race winnings:** Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

    * Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.
    * The second person received 'x + $80'.
    * The third person received '2 * (x + $80)'.

* **Set up an equation:** The total amount divided by three people equals the amount each person received. So:
   (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = x

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: (4x + $160) / 3 = x
    * Multiply both sides by 3: 4x + $160 = 3x

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have half a ball, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
    * Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs together, so x + x = 56 (total eggs)
    * Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so y + 12 = 30 (Camden's eggs)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * 2x = 56 (from the first equation)
    * x = 28 (divide both sides by 2)
    * y = 18 (from the second equation)

* **Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**
    * Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 12 more than Arnold. 
    * Camden painted 12 more than Arnold, so Camden painted 28 + 12 = 40 eggs.

* **Answer:** Camden painted 40 - 28 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
    * Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
    * Let 'G' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
    * C = 2 * G (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
    * J + C + G = Total seashells (They divided the total equally)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Since we know J = C + 5, we can substitute that into the third equation: (C + 5) + C + G = Total seashells
    * Simplify: 2C + G + 5 = Total seashells
    * We need to find a way to express 'G' in terms of 'C' or 'J'.  We can use the first equation (J = C + 5) to solve for 'C':
        * C = J - 5
    * Substitute this value of 'C' into the simplified equation: 2(J - 5) + G + 5 = Total seashells
    * Simplify: 2J - 10 + G + 5 = Total seashells
    * We still need to find 'G' in terms of 'J'.  We can use the fact that J = C + 5 to solve for 'C':
        * C = J - 5
    * Substitute this value of 'C' into the simplified equation: 2(J - 5) + G + 5 = Total seashells
    * Simplify: 2J - 10 + G + 5 = Total seashells
    * Now we have an equation with 'J' and 'G'.  We can solve for 'G' in terms of 'J'.

* **Calculate the final answer:**
    * Once you have 'G' in terms of 'J', substitute it back into the equation to find the total number of seashells.
    * Divide the total seashells by the number of people (3) to find the number of seashells each person gets.

"Let's break this down:

* **Daily energy demand per person:** 1 person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a juice.
* **Total energy demand:** 2300 people * 0.20 (20%) = 460 people's energy demand.
* **Total juice needed:** 460 people * 1 juice/person = 460 juices.
* **Bottles needed:** 460 juices * 4200 bottles/day = 193,200 bottles.

**Answer:** 193,200 bottles

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the number of purple babies:**

* Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple.
* (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies in purple

**2. Find the number of blue babies:**

* Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 1/4 in blue.
* (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies in blue

**3. Find the number of babies wearing bows:**

* 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.
* (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies wearing bows

**4. Find the total number of babies wearing bows:**

* 2 babies in blue + 2 babies in purple = 4 babies wearing bows

**5. Find the percentage of babies wearing purple who also wear bows:**

* (2 babies wearing bows and purple) / (6 babies wearing purple) * 100% = 33.33%


**Final answer: 33.33%**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **First sale:** Abraham sells half his land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He earns $50 for this.
* **Second sale:** He sells 1/4 of the remaining land, which is 80 - 40 = 40 square meters. He earns $30 for this.
* **Remaining land:** After the second sale, he has 80 - 40 - 40 = 0 square meters left.
* **Final sale:** He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter, but he has no land left to sell.

**Therefore, he will earn $0 after selling all his unused land.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **Blue rope length:** The blue rope was 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's x - 7 centimeters long.

* **Red rope length:** The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

* **Combined length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 6x - 28 = 37
    * Add 28 to both sides: 6x = 65
    * Divide both sides by 6: x = 10.83 (approximately)

* **Find the length of the red rope:** 
    * Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (10.83 - 7) = 4 * 3.83 = 15.32 (approximately)

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Rissa's initial amount:**

* Rissa was given thrice the amount Ronnie received, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

**2.  Money after giving to their sister:**

* After giving to their sister, Rissa has $15 - (4/5) * $15 = $15 - $12 = $3 left.

**3. Ronnie's initial amount:**

* Ronnie received $5.

**4. Money after giving to their sister:**

* After giving to their sister, Ronnie has $5 - (4/5) * $5 = $5 - $4 = $1 left.

**Final Answer:** $1

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the amount of each color:** Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, and the mural has 12 pints total, each color represents 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.
* **Calculate the amount of yellow paint:** Half the mural is yellow, so it uses 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.
* **Find the amount of red paint:**  The red, white, and purple paint combined represent 3 pints each, and the yellow paint represents 6 pints.  The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3 pints * 3 colors = 9 pints.  The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 9 pints - 6 pints = 3 pints.

"Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Starting amount:** Thomas starts with $1000.
2. **Bills lost:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 990.
3. **Money after losing bills:** He has 990 dollars.
4. **Using half for a bill:** He uses half of the remaining money, which is 990 / 2 = 495 dollars.
5. **Money after paying the bill:** He has 990 - 495 = 495 dollars left.
6. **Tripling his money:** He triples his remaining money, which is 495 * 3 = 1485 dollars.
7. **Converting to 5 dollar bills:**  He converts his money to 5 dollar bills.  

To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide his total money by the value of each 5 dollar bill:

1485 / 5 = **297**

"Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**First Half:**

* Team A scores 4 goals.
* Team B scores 2 fewer than Team A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

**Second Half:**

* Team B scores 4 times the number of goals from the first half, so they score 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scores 1/4 of Team B's goals, so they score 8 * (1/4) = 2 goals.

**Total Goals:**

* Total goals for Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
* Total goals for Team B: 2 + 8 = 10 goals
* Total goals for the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals

**Final Answer:** 16

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the chalk used on Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the chalk, and he used 20% each day. So, he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.
* **Calculate the chalk remaining:** Since he used 2.25 times the amount of chalk, he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk he normally uses left.
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He needs to recycle the chalk when it's less than 2 inches.  He has 0.44 times the amount of chalk left, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 times the amount of days. 
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He can use the chalk for 2.2 days.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), we can substitute that into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = (5 * 3) / 8
   C = 15/8

3. **Therefore, Colin is currently 15/8 years old.**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know:

* **Each person gets 2 treats.**
* **The class has 5 people.**

Therefore, the total number of treats is: 5 * 2 = 10

**To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:**

* **c + b = 10**  (The total number of treats is equal to the sum of cupcakes and brownies)

**Now, substitute the value of 'b' from the first equation:**

* **c + (3c - 2) = 10**

**Solve for 'c':**

* **4c - 2 = 10**
* **4c = 12**
* **c = 3**

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to convert:**

* Jason needs to sell 15 cars.
* He needs to convert 1 customer for every 2 that come in.
* So, he needs to convert 15 cars / 2 = 7.5 customers.

**2. Calculate the number of calls needed to convert those customers:**

* He needs to convert 7.5 customers.
* He gets 1 customer for every 25 calls.
* So, he needs to make 7.5 customers * 25 calls/customer = 187.5 calls.

**3. Round up to the nearest whole number:**

* Since Jason can't make half a call, he needs to make 188 calls.


**Final answer: 188**

"Okay, let's break down the problem:

* **Flashlights:** Each person needs one flashlight, and there are 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights.
* **Candles:**
    * Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 small candles.
    * The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 medium candles.
    * Total candles: 8 small + 8 medium = 16 candles.
* **Total:** They have 4 flashlights and 16 candles.

**Answer:** 4 + 16 = 20

"Let's break this down:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of each additional phone.**
* **The main phone costs 2x.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**We know:**

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20 
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
