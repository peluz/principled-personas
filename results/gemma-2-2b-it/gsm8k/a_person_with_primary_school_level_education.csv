* **Now we can solve for the number of worker bees:**
   * Since b = 2q, we can substitute that into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) 
   * Simplify: w = 4q

* **We need to find the value of 'q' to get the number of worker bees:**
   * We know there are 700 bees in total. 
   * So, q + b + w = 700
   * Substitute b = 2q and w = 4q: q + 2q + 4q = 700
   * Combine like terms: 7q = 700
   * Solve for q: q = 100

* **Now that we know q (the number of queens), we can find the number of worker bees:**
   * w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = r + 2 (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
   * We know the total eggs from red and white chickens is 42: 3r + 5w = 42

* **Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**
   * Since we know w = r + 2, substitute that into the second equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

   * Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 'b + 0.01b' green jelly beans.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:
   b + (b - 0.01b) + (b + 0.01b) = 4500

* **Solve the equation:**
   3b + 0.02b = 4500

    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  She uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  She uses twice as much oil as salt, so oil = 2 * y.
    *  She uses twice as much salt as zest, so salt = 2 * x.

* **We know the total amount:**
    *  The total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces.

* **Now we can write an equation:**
    *  x + y + fragrance + sugar + oil = 10 ounces

* **Substitute the values we know:**
    *  x + y + x + y + 2y = 10 ounces

* **Simplify the equation:**
    *  2x + 4y = 10 ounces

* **We know x = fragrance and y = salt, so we can substitute:**
    *  2 * x + 4 * y = 10 ounces
    *  2 * x + 4 * (salt) = 10 ounces
    *  2 * x + 4 * (salt) = 10 ounces

* **We can't solve for the exact amount of oil without knowing the amount of salt.** 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of oil Tanya uses with the information given.**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W + 5 = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into the simplified equation: 2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 21 = 339
    * Add 21 to both sides: 9W = 360
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40 

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(40) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 160 - 13
    * Calculate: S = 147

**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours.**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour.
   - Over 5 hours, it loses 9% * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours.**
   - The power bank started with 100% charge.
   - After losing 45%, it had 100% - 45% = 55% charge.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours.**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, it loses 7% * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours.**
   - The power bank had 55% charge.
   - After losing 21%, it had 55% - 21% = 34% charge.

* **Step 5: Calculate the initial charge.**
   - The power bank ended with 28% charge.
   - We know it lost 34% of its charge in the last 3 hours.
   - To find the initial charge, we can use the following equation: 28% = (Initial Charge - 34%) / 100%
   - Solving for the initial charge, we get: Initial Charge = 28% * 100% + 34% = 62%

   * Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's call that number ""x"".
   * Together, they painted 2x eggs.
   * We know they painted 56 eggs total, so 2x + x = 56.
   * Combining like terms: 3x = 56
   * Dividing both sides by 3: x = 18.67 (We can't have fractions of eggs, so let's assume there's a mistake in the problem)

* **Let's figure out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted:**
   * Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so let's call Sarah's eggs ""y"".

   * Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30
   * Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18
   * Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9

* **Now we know how many eggs Sarah painted:**
   * Sarah painted 9 eggs.
   * Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

* **Finally, we can find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**

* **Step 1: Find the number of boxes Nik can fill.**
   Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in groups of 8, so he can fill 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

* **Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

* **Step 3: Convert the weight of the boxes to pounds.**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight of the boxes in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

* **Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.**
   The total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

* **Step 5: Calculate the total weight of the crayons and boxes.**
   The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces + 12.5 pounds = 200 ounces + 12.5 pounds = 212.5 ounces.

* **Step 6: Convert the total weight of the crayons and boxes to pounds.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.
   * The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
   * The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4 * (y - 7)' centimeters long.

* **Set up an equation:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: 
   y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve the equation:**
   * Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
   * Simplify: 6y - 35 = 37
   * Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72
   * Divide both sides by 6: y = 12 

* **Find the length of the yellow rope:**  y = 12 centimeters

* **Find the length of the red rope:** 
   * Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Cost of cognac:** John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.
* **Price per cognac bottle:** Each cognac bottle costs 50% more than a scotch bottle, so it costs $600 / 10 * 1.50 = $90.
* **Total cost of cognac:** He buys 20 bottles at $90 each, so he spends 20 * $90 = $1800 on cognac.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
   * Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * ""Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes"":  b = 3c - 2
   * ""Each person gets two treats"": 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats

* **Solve for the number of cupcakes:**
   * We know the total number of treats is 10. 
   * We also know that b = 3c - 2.
   * We can substitute the value of 'b' in the second equation: 10 = 5 * 2 + (3c - 2)
   * Simplify: 10 = 10 + 3c - 2
   * Continue simplifying: 10 = 8 + 3c
   * Solve for 'c': 2 = 3c

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
   *  S = 12 + K (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)

* **Now we can use the information to solve for Kim's paintings:**
   * Since S = K + 8 and S = 12 + K, we can set them equal to each other:
     K + 8 = 12 + K
   *  Subtract K from both sides: 8 = 12
   *  This means that Kim has 8 paintings.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' be the number of strawberry cubes.**

* **Blueberry cubes:**  5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, that's 5x - 4.
