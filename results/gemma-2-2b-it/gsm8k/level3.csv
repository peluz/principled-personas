"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the annual profit:**

* Revenue per lemon: $1.5
* Number of lemons grown: 7
* Annual revenue: $1.5 * 7 = $10.50
* Annual cost: $3
* Annual profit: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

**2. Set up an equation:**

* This year, he baked twice as many as last year, so he baked 2x cookies.
* He baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
* He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.

The equation is: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

**3. Solve the equation:**

* Simplify the equation: 2x + 10 = 110
* Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 50

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.
* Let 'p' represent the cost of a pepper.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of an orange.

**2. Set Up Equations**

* We know that a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs:  w = 3p
* We also know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon: o = w - 5
* Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges: 4w + 20p + 10o = total cost

**3. Substitute and Solve**

* Substitute the expressions for 'w' and 'o' from the first two equations into the third equation: 
   4(3p) + 20p + 10(w - 5) = total cost
* Simplify: 12p + 20p + 10w - 50 = total cost
* Since we know 'w' = 3p, substitute that in: 12p + 20p + 10(3p) - 50 = total cost
* Combine like terms: 12p + 20p + 30p - 50 = total cost
* Simplify: 62p - 50 = total cost

**4. Find the Total Cost**

* We know each pepper costs $15, so we can find the total cost of the peppers: 20p = 20 * 15 = $300
* Substitute this value back into the equation: 62p - 50 = total cost
* We know Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost is $300.

**5. Find the Total Cost**

* The total cost of the peppers is $300.

"Here's how to calculate the price of the marbles after 36 months:

**Understanding Compound Interest**

This problem involves compound interest, where the interest earned each period is added to the principal, and then the next period's interest is calculated on the new, larger principal.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate the price increase:** 20% of $20 is (20/100) * $20 = $4.

2. **Calculate the price after the first increase:** $20 + $4 = $24.

3. **Calculate the price increase for the next two months:** 20% of $24 is (20/100) * $24 = $4.80.

4. **Calculate the price after the second increase:** $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

5. **Continue this pattern for 36 months:**

   * Month 3: $28.80 + $4.80 = $33.60
   * Month 5: $33.60 + $4.80 = $38.40
   * Month 7: $38.40 + $4.80 = $43.20
   * ... and so on

**Important Note:**  You can use a calculator or spreadsheet to make this calculation easier. 

**Final Answer:**

It's difficult to calculate the exact price after 36 months without a calculator or spreadsheet.  However, you can see that the price will continue to increase by a factor of 1.20 (1 + 20%) each time.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
* Let 'y' represent the amount of water in the big pool.

**2. Set Up the Equations**

* **Initial Condition:**  We know the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This translates to: y - 4 = 2(x - 4) 
* **Current Condition:** We know the big pool has four times the water of the small pool now. This translates to: y + 4 = 4(x + 4)

**3. Solve the System of Equations**

* Simplify the equations:
    * y - 4 = 2x - 8
    * y + 4 = 4x + 16
* Solve for 'y' in terms of 'x' in the first equation:
    * y = 2x - 4
* Substitute this value of 'y' into the second equation:
    * (2x - 4) + 4 = 4x + 16
* Simplify and solve for 'x':
    * 2x = 4x + 16
    * -2x = 16
    * x = -8 

**4. Interpret the Solution**

The solution is x = -8.  However, this doesn't make sense in the context of water volume.  It's likely there's an error in the problem setup.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to check the problem statement for any inconsistencies.  In this case, the initial conditions seem to contradict each other.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of fish in each aquarium.

**2. Set up the equations:**

*  Let 'a' represent the number of snails in the first aquarium.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of snails in the second aquarium.
*  We know: 
    * a + b = 4 + 32 = 36 snails
    * a - b = 2(x + x) = 4x 

**3. Solve the system of equations:**

*  We can solve for 'a' and 'b' using the given information.
*  From the first equation, we know a = 36 - b.
*  Substitute this into the second equation: (36 - b) - b = 4x
*  Simplify: 36 - 2b = 4x
*  Solve for 'b': b = (36 - 4x)/2 = 18 - 2x
*  Substitute this value of 'b' back into the first equation: a + (18 - 2x) = 36
*  Simplify: a = 18 - 2x

**4. Find the number of fish:**

*  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we know x = x. 
*  We can substitute this value of 'x' back into the equation for 'a' to find the number of snails in each aquarium.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the change Billy received:**

* Billy paid $10.00 and the candy cost $1.50 per pound, so he spent $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars on candy, where x is the number of pounds of candy.
* The change is the amount he has left after buying candy.

**2. Calculate the amount spent on gumballs:**

* Billy spent $0.05 per gumball and bought 40 gumballs, so he spent $0.05 * 40 = $2.00 on gumballs.

**3. Calculate the amount of change Billy has left:**

* The amount of change Billy has left is the amount he had before buying candy minus the amount spent on gumballs.
*  $10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00

**4. Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**

* Billy has $8.00 in change, and the candy cost $1.50 per pound.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees.
* Let 'c' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* Joanne's total: a + b + c = 500 
* Joanne's tallest trees: c = 30 / 2 * b  (half the amount from the tallest trees)
* Joanne's shortest trees: b = c / 3 (3 times the amount from the shortest trees)

**Solve for 'a' (the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees):**

1. **Substitute:** Since we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we can substitute 'c' with 30 / 2 * b in the first equation.
2. **Simplify:**  a + b + (30 / 2 * b) = 500
3. **Combine like terms:** a + (3/2)b + 30/2 * b = 500
4. **Simplify further:** a + (3/2)b + 15b = 500
5. **Combine like terms:** a + (3/2)b + 15b = 500
6. **Combine like terms:** a + (33/2)b = 500
7. **Solve for 'a':**  a = 500 - (33/2)b

**Now, we need to use the information about Joanne's sister:**

* Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne: 2 * c = 2 * (30 / 2 * b) = 30b
* Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne: 3 * b = 3 * b

**Set up another equation:**

* Total apples gathered by sister: 30b + 3b = 500

**Solve for 'b':**

1. **Combine like terms:** 33b = 500
2. **Solve for 'b':** b = 500 / 33

**Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation for 'a':**

* a = 500 - (33/2) * (500 / 33)
* a = 500 - 250
* a = 250

**Therefore, Joanne gathered 250 apples from the average trees.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
2. Simplify: (5/2)x + 7 = 43
3. Subtract 7 from both sides: (5/2)x = 36
4. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 36 * (2/5)
5. Calculate: x = 14.4 

**Find Lily's insects:**

* David found x/2 = 14.4 / 2 = 7.2 insects.
* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 14.4/2 + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2 insects.

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Here's how to solve this problem using linear programming:

**1. Define the Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces of wood Frederick buys.
* Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces of wood Frederick buys.

**2. Formulate the Objective Function**

Frederick wants to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make.  He's limited by the cost of wood.  The objective function is:

Maximize:  Z = 200x + 400y 

**3. Formulate the Constraints**

* **Wood Cost Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The total cost of wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Non-negativity Constraints:** x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (Frederick can't buy negative quantities of wood)

**4. Solve the Linear Programming Problem**

We can solve this using graphical methods or a solver. Here's a graphical approach:

* **Graph the Constraints:**
    *  Plot the lines representing the constraints on a graph. The first constraint (4x + 6y ≤ 24) will be a line with a slope of -2/3. The second constraint (x ≥ 0) will be the x-axis. The third constraint (y ≥ 0) will be the y-axis.
* **Find the feasible region:** The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.
* **Identify the corner points:** The corner points of the feasible region are the points where the lines intersect.
* **Evaluate the objective function at each corner point:** The maximum value of the objective function (Z) occurs at the corner point that gives the highest value.

**5. Interpretation**

The corner point that gives the maximum value of Z will tell you the number of 2x4 and 2x8 pieces of wood Frederick should buy to maximize his popsicle stick production while staying within his budget.

**Important Note:**  This problem can be solved using a solver program or software like Excel Solver, which can quickly find the optimal solution.

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Let 'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
* Let 'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans"":  r = 0.99b 
*  ""1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans"": g = 1.01b

**Formulate an equation for the total number of jelly beans:**

*  r + b + g = 4500

**Solve for the number of jelly beans:**

1. **Substitute the expressions for 'r' and 'g' from the first two equations into the third equation:**
   0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

2. **Combine like terms:**
   2.99b = 4500

3. **Solve for 'b' (the number of blue jelly beans):**
   b = 4500 / 2.99 
   b ≈ 1500

4. **Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation for 'r':**
   r = 0.99 * 1500
   r ≈ 1455

5. **Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation for 'g':**
   g = 1.01 * 1500

**Understanding Exponential Growth**

The beanstalk's height is growing exponentially, meaning it doubles each day.  We can represent this with the following equation:

*  Height on day *n* = 4 * 2^(n-1) 

**Finding the Number of Days**

1. **Set up the equation:** We want to find the day when the height is equal to the window height (20 feet). So, we need to solve the equation:
   
   20 = 4 * 2^(n-1)

2. **Simplify:** Divide both sides by 4:
   
   5 = 2^(n-1)

3. **Solve for n:**  We need to find the power to which we need to raise 2 to get 5.  Since 2^3 = 8 and 2^4 = 16, we know that 2^4 = 16 is the closest power to 5.  

4. **Calculate:**  We can see that 2^4 = 16 is the closest power to 5.

    * Let Paisley's distance be represented by ""P""
    * Let Reggie's distance be represented by ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know P = 4 miles (Paisley ran 4 miles)
    * We know R = 5P + 3 (Reggie ran 5 times Paisley's distance and 3 miles farther)
    * We know L + P + R = Total distance (Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie ran together)

* **Substitute to find Lynn's distance:**
    * Substitute the value of P (4 miles) into the equation for R: R = 5(4) + 3 = 23 miles
    * Now we know R = 23 miles
    * Substitute the values of P and R into the equation for L + P + R = Total distance: L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * Simplify: L + 27 = Total distance
    * Since we know the total distance is the sum of the three runners' distances, we can find Lynn's distance by subtracting the distances of Paisley and Reggie from the total distance. 

* **Solve for L:**
    * We know that the total distance is the sum of the distances of Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie. 
    * We know that Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 23 miles. 
    * Therefore, Lynn ran the remaining distance. 
    * We can find Lynn's distance by subtracting the distances of Paisley and Reggie from the total distance.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'a' represent the cost of one apple.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of one orange.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know 4a + 3o = 5.20  (The cost of 4 apples and 3 oranges)
* We also know 3a + 2o = 3.30 (The cost of 3 apples and 2 oranges)

**3. Solve for 'a' and 'o':**

One way to solve this system of equations is using elimination:

* Multiply the second equation by -2:  -6a - 4o = -6.60
* Add this modified equation to the first equation: 
   (4a + 3o) + (-6a - 4o) = 5.20 - 6.60
   This simplifies to: -2a - o = -1.40
* Solve for 'o':  o = 1.40 + 2a
* Substitute this value of 'o' back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation: 4a + 3(1.40 + 2a) = 5.20
* Simplify and solve for 'a': 4a + 4.20 + 6a = 5.20
   10a = 0.80
   a = 0.08 
* Substitute the value of 'a' back into the equation for 'o': o = 1.40 + 2(0.08)
   o = 1.40 + 0.16
   o = 1.56

**4. Calculate the Cost:**

* The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $0.08 = $0.40
* The cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.56 = $7.80
* The total cost is $0.40 + $7.80 = $8.20

**Answer:** Clyde will pay $8.20 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.
* Since he bought 17 fish in total, he bought 'x' white fish and '17-x' orange fish.

**2. Set up the equation:**

* Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish: 3 + (17-x) = 2(x)

**3. Solve the equation:**

* 3 + 17 - x = 2x
* 20 - x = 2x
* 20 = 3x
* x = 20/3

**4. Interpret the answer:**

* Bob bought approximately 6.67 white fish. Since you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round this down to **6** white fish.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest (in ounces)
*  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt (in ounces)
*  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil (in ounces)
*  Let 'w' represent the amount of fragrance (in ounces)

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  **Salt and Sugar:**  y = z 
*  **Citrus Zest and Fragrance:** x = w
*  **Oil and Salt:** z = 2y
*  **Total Volume:** 10 ounces = x + y + z + w

**Solve the system of equations:**

1. **Substitute:** Since we know y = z, we can substitute that into the other equations:
   *  z = 2y
   *  x = w
   *  10 = x + y + z + w

2. **Simplify:**  We can now substitute 'z' and 'x' with their respective values:
   *  z = 2y
   *  x = w
   *  10 = w + y + 2y + w

3. **Combine like terms:**
   *  10 = 2w + 3y

4. **Substitute again:**  We know that x = w and y = z, so we can substitute those in:
   *  10 = 2w + 3(z)
   *  10 = 2w + 3(z)
   *  10 = 2w + 3(y)

5. **Solve for 'w':**  We can now solve for 'w' by substituting 'y' and 'z' with their values:
   *  10 = 2w + 3(z)
   *  10 = 2w + 3(y)
   *  10 = 2w + 3(x)

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let your age be represented by ""x""
* Let your brother's age be represented by ""y""
* Let your sister's age be represented by ""z""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""I am three years younger than my brother"":  x = y - 3
*  ""I am 2 years older than my sister"": x = z + 2
*  ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age"":  Mom's age = 3y - 1

**Now we can use the fact that the sum of our ages is 87:**

x + y + z = 87

**Substitute the values of x from the first three equations into the sum equation:**

(y - 3) + y + (z + 2) = 87

**Simplify and solve for y:**

2y + z - 1 = 87
2y + z = 88
 
**We can't solve for y and z directly yet.  We need to use another equation or a bit of clever substitution.**

**Let's use the fact that we know the relationship between your age and your brother's age:**

*  x = y - 3 
*  x = z + 2

**Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**

(y - 3) = z + 2

**Solve for z:**

z = y - 5

**Now we can substitute this value of z back into the equation 2y + z = 88:**

2y + (y - 5) = 88

**Simplify and solve for y:**

3y - 5 = 88
3y = 93
y = 31

**Now that we know your brother's age (y = 31), we can find your age (x):**

x = y - 3
x = 31 - 3
x = 28

**Finally, we can find your age:**

You are **28 years old**.

* Let Dinar's score be represented by 'x'
* Let Azibo's score be represented by 'y'
* Let Bahati's score be represented by 'z'

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  z = x + 10  (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
*  z = y + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
*  x + y + z = 45 (The total points scored by all three is 45)

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (The total number of Pokemon caught)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Combine** like terms:
   2S + W = 334

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the equation above:
   2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360
   W = 40 

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the equation for S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the number of flights to France and Germany:**

* The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these destinations gets 1/4 of the flights.

**2.  Calculate the total number of flights the first plane makes:**

* Let 'x' be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
* We know 3/4 of the flights are to Greece, so 3/4 * x = number of flights to Greece.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so (1/4) * x = number of flights to France + number of flights to Germany.

**3.  Calculate the number of flights to Poland:**

* The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
* This means the other plane makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**4.  Set up an equation:**

* Let's represent the number of flights to France as 'y'.
* We know the total number of flights is x.
* We also know that the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * x.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so (1/4) * x = y + (1/4) * x.

**5.  Solve for y:**

* We can simplify the equation from step 4 to get: (1/4) * x = y + (1/4) * x
* This simplifies to: y = (1/4) * x

**6.  Use the information about the other plane:**

* We know the other plane makes 22 trips. 
* This means the other plane makes 22 trips.

**7.  Solve for x:**

* The average age of the group is the sum of their ages divided by the number of children.
* Average age = (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
* Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4

**2.  Use Helene's age:**

* Helene is twice as old as the average age.
* Helene's age = 2 * (Average age)

**3. Set up an equation:**

* The total age of the children is 20.
* 3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

**4. Substitute and solve for Helene's age:**

* 3 + 4 + 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age = 20
* 7 + 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age = 20
* 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age = 13 
* 2 * (Average age) = 13 - Wilfred's age
* Helene's age = 2 * (Average age)
* Substitute the value of 2 * (Average age) from the previous step: 
* Helene's age = 2 * (13 - Wilfred's age)

**5. Solve for Wilfred's age:**

* We know Helene is twice as old as the average age.
* Substitute Helene's age in terms of the average age: 2 * (Average age) = 2 * (13 - Wilfred's age)

**1.  Calculate the initial charge:**

* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* After 5 hours of charging at 9% loss, the power bank had 100% - 0.09x = 0.91x charge.
* We know the power bank had 28% charge after 3 hours of losing 7% of its capacity.

**2.  Set up an equation:**

*  The power bank lost 7% of its charge for 3 hours, so we can express this as 0.07 * (x - 0.91x) = 0.07x - 0.0637x = 0.0063x.

**Understanding Depreciation**

Depreciation is the decrease in value of an asset over time.  It's calculated using the following formula:

* **Depreciation = Original Price * Depreciation Rate**

**Calculations**

* **Year 2007:**  
   * Depreciation = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
   * Car Value in 2007 = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

* **Year 2008:**
   * Depreciation = $15800 * 0.21 = $3318

2. **Substitute** the value of S (9) into the third equation: C = 9 + 12
   *  C = 21 (Camden painted 21 eggs)

3. **Substitute** the value of C (21) into the first equation: A + M = 56
   *  We need to find A and M, but we can use the fact that A = M to solve for them.

4. **Substitute** the value of C (21) into the first equation: A + M = 56
   *  A + M = 56
   *  Since A = M, we can substitute M for A: 2M = 56
   *  Divide both sides by 2: M = 28 (Madeline painted 28 eggs)

**3. Solve for 's' (number of sunflowers):**

* Substitute the value of 'b' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
    * 2s + 8(12) = 26
* Simplify: 2s + 96 = 26
* Subtract 96 from both sides: 2s = -70
* Divide both sides by 2: s = -35

**4. Analyze the Result:**

* We got a negative value for 's', which doesn't make sense in this context. This means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to sell a negative number of sunflowers.

* Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
* Let 'A' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
* A = 2C (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
* J + A + C = Total seashells (They divided the total equally)

**Solve for the variables:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""c""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""w""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **In 7 years:** Colin will be c + 7 years old.
* **Wendy's age in 7 years:** w + 7 years old.
* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years:** w + 7 = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years:** Colin will be c + 25 years old.
* **Wendy's age in 25 years:** w + 25 years old.
* **Colin will be a third as old as Wendy in 25 years:** w + 25 = (3/1) * (w + 25)

**Solve the system of equations:**

1. **Simplify the equations:**
   * w + 7 = 5c + 35
   * w + 25 = 3w + 75

2. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   * w = 5c + 28

3. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   * (5c + 28) + 25 = 3w + 75

4. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   * 5c + 53 = 3(5c + 28)
   * 5c + 53 = 15c + 84
   * -10c = 31
   * c = -3.1

5. **Since age cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement.**
