"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's represent the unknown:** 
    * Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

* **Green House:** She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving (2/3)x.

* **Red House:** She sold 2 more at the red house, leaving (2/3)x + 2.

* **Orange House:** She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2/3)x + 2 / 2 = (1/3)(2/3)x + 2 = (1/3)x + 2.

* **Total Sold:**  The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is (1/3)x + 2 + (1/3)x + 2 = 2(1/3)x + 4

* **Final Amount:** She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2/3)x + 2 + (1/3)x + 2 = 5

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: (5/3)x + 4 = 5
    * Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/3)x = 1

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the cost of a single red tie:**

* Since blue ties cost $40 each, and red ties cost 50% more, let's represent the cost of a blue tie as 'x'.
* The cost of a red tie is then 'x + (50/100)x = 1.5x'.

**2. Calculate the number of blue ties:**

* He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

**3. Calculate the cost of the red ties:**

* He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.
* The cost of the red ties is 10 * 1.5x = 15x.

**4. Calculate the total cost:**

* The total cost of the blue ties is 5 * 40 = $200.
* The total cost of the red ties is 15x.
* Therefore, the total cost is 200 + 15x.

**5. Solve for x:**

* We know the total cost is $200, and we know the cost of a blue tie is $40.
* So, 200 = 5 * 40 + 15x
* Simplifying, 200 = 200 + 15x
* Subtracting 200 from both sides, 0 = 15x
* Dividing both sides by 15, x = 0.

**6. Calculate the total cost:**

* Since x = 0, the total cost of the ties is 200 + 15 * 0 = $200.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * He wants to make twice as many this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.
    * He baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
    * He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 10 = 110

**Therefore, there were 7 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

**Understanding the Problem**

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price is increasing exponentially.

**Calculations**

* **Month 1:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4.  The new price is $20 + $4 = $24.
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.8. The new price is $24 + $4.8 = $28.8.
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.8, which is $5.76. The new price is $28.8 + $5.76 = $34.56.
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is $6.91. The new price is $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47.
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is $8.29. The new price is $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76.
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is $9.95. The new price is $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71.
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is $11.94. The new price is $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65.
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is $14.33. The new price is $71.65 + $14.33 = $86.98.
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $86.98, which is $17.39. The new price is $86.98 + $17.39 = $104.37.
* **Month 10:** The price increases by 20% of $104.37, which is $20.87. The new price is $104.37 + $20.87 = $125.24.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let Seth's current age be ""S""
* Let Brooke's current age be ""B""

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke"":  S = 2B
*  ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28"": (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

**3. Solve the equations:**

* Substitute the first equation into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
* Simplify: 3B + 4 = 28
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24
* Divide both sides by 3: B = 8 
* Now that you know Brooke's age (B = 8), plug it back into the first equation to find Seth's age: S = 2 * 8 = 16

**Understanding the Problem**

* The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
* We need to find the time it takes to reach 100% charge.

**Solution**

1. **Calculate the charge needed:**  To reach 100%, the phone needs to gain 100% - 60% = 40% of charge.

2. **Determine the time:**  Since the phone charges at 1% per 3 minutes, it will take 40% / 1% per 3 minutes = 120 minutes to charge.

3. **Convert to hours:** 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Billy's change:**

* Billy paid $10.00 and the candy cost $1.50 per pound, so he spent $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars on candy, where x is the number of pounds of candy.
* We know he has $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars left after buying candy.
* We also know he spent half his change on gumballs, so he spent $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) / 2 dollars on gumballs.

**2. Calculate the number of pounds of candy:**

* We know he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so he spent $40.00 on gumballs.
* We can set up an equation to represent this: $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) / 2 = $40.00
* Solve for x:
    * Multiply both sides by 2: $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) = $80.00
    * Subtract $10.00 from both sides: -$1.50 * x = $70.00
    * Divide both sides by -$1.50: x = -46.67

**3. Interpret the result:**

* The result of x = -46.67 is not a valid number of pounds of candy. This means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to buy candy and gumballs with the given information.

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Guaranteed not to explode:** This means the candles that don't smell like wet dog are safe.
* **5% have a defect:** This means 5% of the candles are defective and smell like wet dog.

**Setting up the Solution**

Let's use the following:

* **x:**  The number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode.
* **y:** The number of candles that don't smell like wet dog.

We know:

* **y = 50000 - x** (total candles - the number that smell like wet dog and explode)
* **x = 0.05y** (5% of the candles are defective)

**Solving for x**

We can use the information about the defective candles to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode.

1. **Substitute:** Since we know x = 0.05y, we can substitute that into the equation for y:
   * y = 50000 - x
   * y = 50000 - (0.05y)

2. **Solve for y:**
   * y = 50000 - 0.05y
   * 1.05y = 50000
   * y = 47619.09 (approximately)

3. **Find x:**
   * x = 0.05 * 47619.09
   * x = 2380.95 (approximately)

**Answer:**

Since we can't have a fraction of a candle, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, approximately 2380 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: (5/2)x + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: (5/2)x = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 14.4

**Find Lily's insects:**

* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's break down the shingles needed for each house:**
    * The first house needs 1/2 the amount of the second house.
    * The third house needs double the amount of the first house.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house.
    * The first house needs 1/2x cases.
    * The third house needs 2 * (1/2x) = x cases.

* **Total shingles needed:**
    * The total number of shingles needed is 250 cases.
    * So, 1/2x + x + x = 250

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 3/2x = 250
    * Multiply both sides by 2/3: x = 166.67

* **Calculate the shingles for the third house:**
    * The third house needs x = 166.67 cases.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest (in ounces)
*  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt (in ounces)
*  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil (in ounces)

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  **Citrus zest = Fragrance:** x = fragrance
*  **Salt = Sugar:** y = sugar
*  **Oil = 2 * Salt:** z = 2y
*  **Salt = 2 * Zest:** y = 2x

**Solve for the amount of oil (z):**

1. **Substitute the value of 'y' from the second equation into the third equation:** z = 2 * (2x) = 4x
2. **Substitute the value of 'y' from the fourth equation into the third equation:** z = 4 * (x) = 4x

**We now know that z = 4x.  We also know that x = z.  Therefore:**

* z = 4x = 4 * (x) = 4x

**Since we know that z = 4x, we can substitute this into the equation for z to find the amount of oil:**

* z = 4x = 4 * (x) = 4x

**Therefore, Tanya uses 4x ounces of oil.** 

**We can't determine the exact amount of oil Tanya uses without knowing the value of x (the amount of zest).**

"Here's how to solve this problem using the concept of proportionality:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos:**  They travel at a certain speed, and the time it takes them to travel is inversely proportional to their speed.
* **Turtles:**  They travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is reduced.

**Setting up the Proportion**

Let's use the following variables:

*  *x* = the speed of a kangaroo
*  *t* = the time it takes for a kangaroo to travel

We know:

* 3 kangaroos travel for 18 hours. 
*  We need to find the time it takes 4 turtles to travel.

**The Formula**

The relationship between time and speed is:

* Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance is constant, we can simplify the equation:

* Time ∝ 1/Speed

**Solving for the Time of the Turtles**

1. **Find the speed of a turtle:**  A turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so its speed is *x/2*.

2. **Calculate the time for the turtles:**  
   * Time for turtles = Distance / Speed 
   * Time for turtles = 18 hours * (4 turtles) / (x/2) 
   * Time for turtles = 18 hours * (8/x)

3. **Simplify:**  
   * Time for turtles = 144/x

**Final Answer**

The time it takes four turtles to travel across the highway is **144/x** hours. 

**Important Note:**  We cannot get a numerical answer without knowing the speed of a kangaroo (x).

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* Melanie's age in 10 years: 18 years
* We need to find the number of years it takes for her age to be three times her current age.

**Setting up the Equation**

Let Melanie's current age be represented by 'x'.  

In 10 years, her age will be: x + 10

We know that in 10 years, her age will be thrice her present age, so:
x + 10 = 3x

**Solving for x**

* Subtract x from both sides: 10 = 2x
* Divide both sides by 2: 5 = x

**Finding the Answer**

Melanie's current age is 5 years.  

To find the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age, we need to find the number of years it takes for her age to be 3 * 5 = 15.

**Therefore, it will take Melanie 15 years for her age to be thrice her present age.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Combine** like terms:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the second equation into the above equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** and solve for W:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339
   2S + 4W = 347

5. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the simplified equation:
   2(S + 5) + 4W = 347

6. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   2S + 10 + 4W = 347
   2S + 4W = 337
   2S = 337 - 4W
   S = (337 - 4W) / 2

7. **Substitute** this value of S back into the equation S = 4W - 13:
   (337 - 4W) / 2 = 4W - 13

8. **Solve for W:**
   337 - 4W = 8W - 26
   363 = 12W
   W = 30.25

9. **Substitute** the value of W back into the equation S = (337 - 4W) / 2:
   S = (337 - 4 * 30.25) / 2
   S = (337 - 121) / 2
   S = 216 / 2
   S = 108

**Therefore, Stan has caught 108 Pokemon.**

* When Emil turns 24, he will be half his dad's age.  Let Emil's dad's age be 'd'.  
*  Emil will be half his dad's age: d/2
*  Emil will be twice his brother's age. Let his brother's age be 'b'.
*  Emil will be twice his brother's age: 2b

**2. Setting up the equation:**

* We know that Emil's age when he turns 24 will be: d/2 = 2b

**3.  Finding the ages:**

* We know Emil is currently 19 years old. 
*  When he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older than his brother.
*  We can now set up an equation to find the ages of his dad and brother: 
    * Emil's age (24) = 5 years older than his brother's age
    * Emil's age (24) = 2b
    * Emil's age (24) = d/2

**4. Solving for the ages:**

*  We know that Emil's age (24) = 2b
*  We also know that Emil's age (24) = d/2
*  Therefore, 2b = d/2
*  Multiply both sides by 2: 4b = d
*  We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so when he turns 24, he will be 5 years older than his brother.
*  Therefore, his brother's age is 24 - 5 = 19 years old.
*  His dad's age is 4 times his brother's age, so his dad's age is 4 * 19 = 76 years old.

**5.  Finding the sum:**

* The sum of the ages of his dad and brother is 76 + 19 = 95 years.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the average age:**

* The average age of the group is the sum of their ages divided by the number of children.
* Average age = (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
* Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4

**2.  Use Helene's age:**

* Helene is twice as old as the average age, so we can write an equation: Helene's age = 2 * (Average age)

**3.  Set up an equation:**

* We know the total age is 20, so: (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20
* Substitute Helene's age from step 2: (3 + 4 + 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age) = 20

**4.  Solve for the average age:**

* Simplify the equation: (7 + 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age) = 20
* Since we know Helene is twice the average age, we can substitute: (7 + 2 * (Average age) + Wilfred's age) = 20
*  We can't solve for the average age directly yet, but we can use the information about Helene's age to find Wilfred's age.

**5.  Find Wilfred's age:**

*  We know Helene is twice the average age, so we can find the average age by dividing the total age by the number of children: Average age = 20 / 4 = 5
*  Now we can find Helene's age: Helene's age = 2 * 5 = 10
*  We know Helene is twice the average age, so we can find Wilfred's age: Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20 - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age)
*  We know Helene's age is 10 and Akbar's age is 3, and Alessandro's age is 4. 
*  Therefore, Wilfred's age is 20 - (3 + 4) = 20 - 7 = 13

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Step 1:**  We need to figure out the initial charge of the power bank.
* **Step 2:** We need to determine the charge after the first 5 hours.
* **Step 3:** We need to determine the charge after the next 3 hours.
* **Step 4:** We can then use the information about the final charge to calculate the initial charge.

**Calculations**

* **Step 1: Initial Charge**
   * Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
   * After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour, so after 5 hours it has 95% of its original charge.
   * We know the final charge is 28%, so we can set up an equation: 0.28 = 0.95 * x - 0.09 * 5 
* **Step 2: Charge after 5 hours**
   * We can solve the equation from Step 1 to find the initial charge.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
* Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

**2. Set Up the Equation:**

* The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so the earnings from large stuffed animals are 3 * (4 * small stuffed animals) = 12 * small stuffed animals.
* The earnings from small stuffed animals are 4 * small stuffed animals.
* The total earnings are the sum of earnings from large and small stuffed animals: 12 * small stuffed animals + 4 * small stuffed animals = $120

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine the earnings from small stuffed animals: 16 * small stuffed animals = $120
* Divide both sides by 16 to find the number of small stuffed animals: 16 * small stuffed animals / 16 = $120 / 16
* Therefore, she sold 7.5 small stuffed animals.

**Understanding Proportional Pricing**

The key is that the prices are proportional. This means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is the same for all packages. 

* **Package 1:** 2 sandwiches / $3
* **Package 2:** 4 sandwiches / $6

**Finding the Price Ratio**

Let's find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for each package:

* **Package 1:** $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
* **Package 2:** $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

**Calculating the Price of Package 3**

Since the prices are proportional, the price of package 3 will also be $1.50 per sandwich.

* **Package 3:** 8 sandwiches / $1.50 per sandwich = 5.33 sandwiches

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg.** This means the T-Rex and the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat.
* **The T-Rex and velociraptors ate half of what was left.**  This means the T-Rex ate half of the meat that was left after the velociraptors ate half.
* **The T-Rex ate half of the meat.** This means the T-Rex ate half of the meat that was left after the velociraptors ate half.

Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' be the original amount of meat on the triceratops.**

* **T-Rex eats half:** x / 2
* **Velociraptors eat half of what's left:** (x / 2) / 2 = x / 4
* **Allosaurus eats the last 270 kg:** x / 4 - 270 = 0

**Solving for x:**

* **To find the original amount of meat, we need to find the value of x.** 

* **We know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg of meat.** 

* **Therefore, x / 4 - 270 = 0**

* **Add 270 to both sides:** x / 4 = 270

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

**2. Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**3. Solve the equation:**

* x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

**4. Calculate the length of the red rope:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Figure out how much Rissa started with:**

* Rissa was given thrice the amount Ronnie received, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

**2. Determine how much Rissa gave away:**

* Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, meaning she gave away (1 - 4/5) = 1/5 of her money.
*  Let 'x' be the amount Rissa gave away.  We know: 15 - x = (1/5) * 15

**3. Solve for x:**

* 15 - x = 3
* x = 15 - 3
* x = 12

**4. Calculate how much Rissa has left:**

* Rissa has 15 - 12 = $3 left.

**5. Calculate how much Ronnie has left:**

* Ronnie gave away the same amount as Rissa, so he also gave away $12.
* Ronnie has $5 - $12 = -$7.

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20

**Understanding the Problem**

* We know the total length of the board is 40 feet.
* The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

**Setting up the Equation**

Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is then 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of both pieces:  x + 4x = 40

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of telephone calls Jason makes.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of customers who come into the dealership.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of cars sold.

**2. Set up Equations:**

* We know that for every 25 calls, he gets 1 customer:  x / 25 = y
* We also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold: y / 2 = z

**3. Solve for 'y' (the number of customers):**

*  From the first equation, we can solve for 'y': y = (25 * x)

**4. Solve for 'z' (the number of cars sold):**

* Substitute the value of 'y' from the previous step into the second equation: z = (y / 2) = (25 * x / 2)

**5.  Find the number of calls to sell 15 cars:**

* We want to find the number of calls (x) that will result in 15 cars sold (z).
*  We know z = (25 * x / 2)
*  We need to find the value of 'x' that makes z = 15.
*  Substitute z = 15 into the equation: 15 = (25 * x / 2)
*  Multiply both sides by 2: 30 = 25 * x
*  Divide both sides by 25: x = 1.2

**6.  Interpret the Result:**

*  Jason needs to make approximately 1.2 calls to sell 15 cars. 

**Important Note:**  This result is not a whole number.  This is because the problem is asking for a whole number of calls to reach the desired number of cars sold.  It's likely there's an error in the provided information.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Find James's current age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** John was 19 when he had James, so he is currently 32 + 19 = 51 years old.
* **Find the youngest son's age:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 - 19 = 13 years old.
* **Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, he will be 13 + 3 = 16 years old.

"This is a bit of a trick question! Here's why:

* **Focus on the time spent peeling:** The question focuses on the time spent peeling, not the number of oranges. 
* **Individual work:**  Ana and Jane are working independently. 
* **Equal time:**  Since they start at the same time, they will peel the same number of oranges.

**Therefore, the answer is 0.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know that c + w = 20 (total number of animals)
* We know that 2c + 4w = 70 (total number of legs) 

**3. Solve for One Variable:**

* Solve the first equation for 'c':  c = 20 - w

**4. Substitute:**

* Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

**5. Simplify and Solve for 'w':**

* 40 - 2w + 4w = 70
* 2w = 30
* w = 15

**6. Solve for 'c':**

* c = 20 - w
* c = 20 - 15
* c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm. 
 
**Therefore, the answer is 5.**
