"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's represent Grace's weight with the variable ""G""** 
* **Alex's weight can be represented as ""A""**

We know:

* **A = 4G - 2** (Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight)
* **G + A = Total weight**

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* **G + (4G - 2) = Total weight**

Simplify and solve for G:

* **5G - 2 = Total weight**

We know Grace weighs 125 pounds, so:

* **5G - 2 = 125**
* **5G = 127**
* **G = 25.4**

Now that we know Grace's weight (G = 25.4), we can find Alex's weight:

* **A = 4 * 25.4 - 2**
* **A = 101.6 - 2**
* **A = 101.6**

Finally, calculate their combined weight:

* **Total weight = G + A**
* **Total weight = 25.4 + 101.6**
* **Total weight = 127**


**Therefore, their combined weights are 127 pounds.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Corey's age:** James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old. So Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
* **Amy's age:** Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and Corey is 11 years old. So Amy is 11 + 5 = 16 years old.
* **Jackson's age:** Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, and Corey is 11 years old. So Jackson is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

**Therefore, Jackson is 9 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time was 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:** Gerald's improved time is now 'x + 0.1x' (10% improvement on his original time).
* **Set up the equation:** We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation: 
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Calculate Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.**
* **He wants to make twice as many this year:**  This means he baked 2x cookies this year.
* **He baked 15 more than he meant to:** This means he baked 2x - 15 cookies.
* **He dropped 5 cookies:** This means he has 110 - 5 = 105 cookies left.
* **He baked 105 cookies this year:**  This means 2x - 15 = 105

Now we can solve for x:

1. **Add 15 to both sides:** 2x = 120
2. **Divide both sides by 2:** x = 60

**Therefore, Henry baked 60 cookies last year.**

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Jamal's phone capacity:** Jamal's phone holds 1800 photographs.
* **Brittany's phone capacity:**  Jamal's phone holds 6 times more photos than Brittany's, so Brittany's phone holds 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.
* **Birds in the photo:** Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.  Let's call the number of ducks ""x"".  So, 300 = 50 * x.
* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 50: x = 300 / 50 = 6.

**Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.**

"Here's how to calculate Sasha's profit:

**1. Calculate the cost of the 2x4x10 boards:**

* Cost per board: $10
* Number of boards: 10
* Total cost: $10 * 10 = $100

**2. Calculate the cost of the 4x4x10 boards:**

* Cost per board: $16
* Number of boards: 5
* Total cost: $16 * 5 = $80

**3. Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**

* Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

**4. Calculate the total selling price of the lumber:**

* We need to know the selling price per board for each type of lumber. 
* We need to know the selling price per board for the 2x4x10 boards. 
* We need to know the selling price per board for the 4x4x10 boards. 

**5. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit = Total selling price - Total cost

**Please provide the selling price per board for each type of lumber so I can calculate the profit.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

* **Finding the Unit:**  We know the total teaspoons of sugar is 120.  We need to find out how many cups of water she used.

* **Setting up the Equation:**  Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water.  We can set up an equation based on the ratio:

   (7/13) * 120 = x

* **Solving for x:**
   * 7 * 120 / 13 = x
   * 840 / 13 = x
   * x = 64.62 (approximately)

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Seagull eats half:** The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Pigeons eat some:**  Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Remaining fries:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 6 fries left.
* **Raccoon steals two-thirds:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining 6 fries, which is (2/3) * 6 = 4 fries.
* **Final count:** After the raccoon, there were 6 - 4 = 2 fries left.
* **Ants take one:** The ants took one final french fry, leaving 2 - 1 = 1 french fry.

**Therefore, there were 14 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Let's break down the price increase:

* **Month 1:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is (20/100) * $20 = $4.
* **Month 2:** The price is now $20 + $4 = $24.
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is (20/100) * $24 = $4.80.
* **Month 4:** The price is now $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We can see a pattern here.  

* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is (20/100) * $28.80 = $5.76.
* **Month 6:** The price is now $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

You can continue this pattern to calculate the price after 36 months. 

**However, there's a more efficient way to solve this:**

The price increases by 20% every two months, so we can calculate the price after 36 months by:

* **Month 1:** $20
* **Month 2:** $20 + (20/100) * $20 = $24
* **Month 3:** $24 + (20/100) * $24 = $28.80
* **Month 4:** $28.80 + (20/100) * $28.80 = $34.56
* **Month 5:** $34.56 + (20/100) * $34.56 = $42.28
* **Month 6:** $42.28 + (20/100) * $42.28 = $50.96
* **Month 7:** $50.96 + (20/100) * $50.96 = $59.92
* **Month 8:** $59.92 + (20/100) * $59.92 = $69.96
* **Month 9:** $69.96 + (20/100) * $69.96 = $80.96
* **Month 10:** $80.96 + (20/100) * $80.96 = $92.96

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by ""B""**
* **Let Seth's current age be represented by ""S""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Since Brooke's age must be a whole number, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume Brooke is 8 years old.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 5x/2 = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 210
3. Divide both sides by 5: x = 42

**Understanding the Problem**

* The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
* We need to find the time it takes to reach 100% charge.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate the charge needed:**  To go from 60% to 100%, the phone needs to gain 40% of charge (100% - 60% = 40%).

2. **Determine the time:**  Since the phone charges at 1% per 3 minutes, we need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to gain 40%.

   *  40% charge / (1% charge per 3 minutes) = 40 minutes 
   *  Total time = 40 minutes / (1% charge per 3 minutes) = 120 minutes

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 * 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
* **Shoplifting:** 3 * (4 * 3 - 5) = 3 * (12 - 5) = 3 * 7 = 21
* **Physical Violence:** 3 * (4 * 3 - 5) = 3 * (12 - 5) = 3 * 7 = 21

**Total:** 7 (mask refusal) + 21 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 50

**Therefore, 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.**

* **He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the earnings from selling cards:** Kenny can sell $1.5 * x cards, where 'x' is the number of cards he has.
* **Calculate the amount of money he needs to earn:** He needs to earn $100 to buy the ticket.
* **Calculate the amount of money he has after keeping some cards:** He has $50 in spending cash, and he needs to earn $100 - $50 = $50 more.
* **Set up an equation:**  The amount of money he earns from selling cards must be equal to the amount he needs to earn.  So, 1.5x = $50.
* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 1.5: x = $50 / 1.5 = 33.33.

**Since he can't have a fraction of a card, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume he sold enough cards to make $50.  **

* **Calculate the number of cards he sold:**  He sold $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 cards. 
* **Calculate the number of cards he kept:** He kept 1/3 of his collection, so he kept 33.33 * (1/3) = 11.11 cards. 
* **Calculate the number of cards he started with:** He sold 33.33 cards and kept 11.11 cards, so he started with 33.33 + 11.11 = 44.44 cards. 

**Therefore, Kenny started with approximately 44 cards.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent Brad's share with the variable 'x'.** 
* **Jeff gets 4 times Brad's share, so Jeff gets 4x.**
* **The total amount of money is $100, so x + 4x = $100**
* **Combine like terms: 5x = $100**
* **Divide both sides by 5 to find x: x = $20**
* **Jeff gets 4 times Brad's share, so Jeff gets 4 * $20 = $80**

**Answer: $80**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Twice:** Elise writes the alphabet twice, so that's 26 letters.
* **Once:** She writes half the alphabet once, which is 13 letters.
* **Re-writing:** She rewrites everything she's written, so she's essentially writing the alphabet again.

**Total:** 26 + 13 + 26 = **65 letters**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the time Ray takes to swim a mile in cold water.**
* **Twice the time in cold water is 2x.**
* **Twice the time in cold water plus 2 minutes is 2x + 2 minutes.**
* **This time is the time Ray takes in warm water.**

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Let 'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
* Let 'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.

**Set up equations based on the information given:**

*  ""This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans"":  r = 0.99b 
*  ""1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans"": g = 1.01b

**We also know the total number of jelly beans is 4500:**

* r + b + g = 4500

**Now we can solve for the number of jelly beans:**

1. **Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:**
   (0.99b) + b + (1.01b) = 4500

2. **Combine like terms:**
   2.99b = 4500

3. **Solve for b (the number of blue jelly beans):**
   b = 4500 / 2.99 
   b ≈ 1500

4. **Substitute the value of b back into the equation for 'r':**
   r = 0.99 * 1500
   r ≈ 1455

5. **Substitute the value of b into the equation for 'g':**
   g = 1.01 * 1500
   g ≈ 1515

6. **Find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:**
   g - r = 1515 - 1455 = 60

**Answer:** The jar contains 60 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

* **Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.**

* **Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2x + 3.**

* **We know Janey has 21 books, so 2x + 3 = 21**

Now we can solve for x:

* **Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18**
* **Divide both sides by 2: x = 9**

**Therefore, Sally has 9 books.**

* **Twice as many dogs:**  There are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 dogs * 2 = 24 dogs in the shelter.
* **Toys needed:** James needs toys for 24 dogs, so he needs 24 dogs * 1 toy/dog = 24 toys.
* **Toys bought:** James bought 24 toys - 16 toys = 8 more toys.
* **Final count:** James now has 16 toys + 8 toys = 24 toys.
* **Dogs left:** 3 dogs left, so he no longer needs the 8 toys.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.**

* **Extending the dress by 50%:**  This means the dress is now 1.5x long.

* **Adding the lace trim:** The final length is 140cm, so we can set up an equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we need to find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 40% of the water = 0.40
   * 0.40 * (total water) = amount used by the city

* **Step 2: Find the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   If 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 80% of the water used by the city = 0.80
   * 0.80 * (amount used by the city) = amount used for industrial purposes

* **Step 3: Find the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the amount used for industrial purposes from the total amount used by the city.
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = total amount used - amount used for industrial purposes
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = 0.40 * (total water) - 0.80 * (amount used by the city)

* **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can divide the amount used for non-industrial purposes by the total amount used by the city and multiply by 100%.

**Final Answer:** 
 
I cannot provide a numerical answer without knowing the total amount of water in the Colorado River.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house.
    * The first house needs 1/2 of the second, so it needs x/2 cases.
    * The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

* **Total cases:** The total number of cases needed is 250.  We can set up an equation: 
    * x + x/2 + x = 250

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: (5/2)x + x = 250
    * Simplify: (7/2)x = 250
    * Multiply both sides by (2/7): x = 250 * (2/7) = 71.43 (approximately)

* **Calculate the third house's shingles:**
    * The third house needs x = 71.43 cases.

**Final answer:** 71.43 


**Note:** Since we can't have a fraction of a case of shingles, we'll round this up to the nearest whole number.  The third house will need **72** cases of shingles.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let my brother's age be ""B""
* Let my age be ""V""
* Let my sister's age be ""S""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* ""I am three years younger than my brother"":  V = B - 3
* ""I am 2 years older than my sister"": V = S + 2
* ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age"": Mom's age = 3B - 1

**Now we can use the fact that the sum of our ages is 87:**

V + B + S = 87

**Substitute the values we know from the other equations into the sum equation:**

(B - 3) + B + (S + 2) = 87

**Simplify and solve for B:**

2B + S - 1 = 87
2B + S = 88 

**We still need to find S.  We can use the fact that V = S + 2 and V = B - 3:**

* Substitute V = B - 3 into the equation 2B + S = 88:
   2B + (S + 2) = 88
   2B + S + 2 = 88
   2B + S = 86

* Now we have two equations:
    * 2B + S = 86
    * 2B + S = 88

*  Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate S:
   (2B + S) - (2B + S) = 88 - 86
   0 = 2

* This equation is not possible.  There is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let John's age be represented by 'x'.**
* **Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is 'x + 10'.**
* **Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is 'x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10'.**
* **The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we have the equation: 2x + 10 + x + 10 = 100**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 3x + 20 = 100**
* **Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 80**
* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 26.67** 

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's assume the question meant that the combined age is 100 years old. 

**Let's solve for Peter's age:**

* **Peter's age is 2x + 10 = 2(26.67) + 10 = 53.34 + 10 = 63.34**

**Therefore, Peter's age is approximately 63.34 years old.**

* **Seven times the number of loaves Sam had:** 7 * 70 = 490 loaves
* **40 less than seven times Sam's loaves:** 490 - 40 = 450 loaves

**Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Deanna is 26:** This is our starting point.
* **Marcus is half of Leo's age:**  This means Marcus's age is half of Leo's age.
* **Marcus is five years younger than Deanna:** This means Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

**Now we can find Leo's age:**

* **Marcus is half of Leo's age:**  Let Leo's age be represented by ""L"". So, Marcus's age is L/2.
* **Marcus is 21 years old:**  Therefore, L/2 = 21
* **Solve for L:** Multiply both sides by 2: L = 42

**Answer:** Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let Dinar's score be represented by ""x"".**
* **Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo:**  This means Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* **Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar:** This means Bahati scored x + 10 points.

**Now we can set up an equation:**

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

**Simplify and solve for x:**

3x + 30 = 45
3x = 15
x = 5

**Since Dinar scored 5 points, Azibo scored:**

x + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25

**Answer:** Azibo scored 25 points.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'X' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + X = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)
*  X = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4A - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the expressions for X and S from the first two equations into the third equation:
   (S + 5) = 4A - 13

2. **Solve for S** in terms of A:
   S = 4A - 18

3. **Substitute** this value of S into the first equation:
   A + (4A - 18) + X = 339

4. **Simplify** and solve for X:
   5A - 18 + X = 339
   5A + X = 357
   X = 357 - 5A

5. **Substitute** the expression for X back into the equation S = 4A - 18:
   S = 4A - 18

6. **Substitute** the expression for X into the equation S = 4A - 18:
   S = 4A - 18

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Flights to France and Germany:**

* The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those destinations gets 1/4 of the flights.

**2. Flights to Poland:**

* The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of trips the first plane makes.

**3.  Calculate the total number of flights for the first plane:**

* Let's assume the first plane makes 'x' number of flights in a day.
* The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4)x / 2 = (1/8)x flights.
* The other plane flies to Poland for 44 trips.

**4. Set up an equation:**

* We know the other plane flies to Poland for half the number of flights the first plane makes, so: 44 = (1/8)x 

**5. Solve for x:**

* Multiply both sides by 8: 352 = x

**6. Calculate the number of flights to France:**

* The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights, so it flies to Greece for (3/4) * 352 = 264 flights.
* The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so it flies to France for (1/8) * 352 = 44 flights.

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it lost 9% * 5 hours = 45% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%

**2. Calculate the charge after 8 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its charge for 3 hours, so it lost 7% * 3 hours = 21% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%

**3. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.
* We can use the following equation to find the initial charge: 28% = (Initial Charge) * (1 - 0.09) ^ 8 
* Solving for the initial charge, we get: Initial Charge = 28% / (1 - 0.09)^8 

**4. Calculate the initial charge:**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.
    * The second person received 'x + $80'.
    * The third person received '2 * (x + $80)'.

* **Set up an equation:** The total amount divided by three people is equal to the amount each person received. So: 
   (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = x

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: (4x + $160) / 3 = x

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have half a ball, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each:  x + x = 2x
* Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
* Total eggs painted: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**Solve for y (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

**Solve for x (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

* 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
* 56 = 56 

**Solve for the difference between Camden and Arnold's eggs:**

* Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12 = 34 - x

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **First Sale:** Abraham sells half his land for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

2. **Second Sale:** He sells 1/4 of the remaining land for $30, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

3. **Remaining Land:** After the second sale, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

4. **Final Sale:** He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earns 20 * $3 = $60.

**Total Earnings:**  He earns a total of $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Stacy's eggs:** Stacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar, who found 5. So Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
* **Charlie's eggs:** Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, who found 10. So Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* **Mei's eggs:** Mei finds half as many eggs as Charlie, who found 8. So Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
* **Total eggs found:**  In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
* **Eggs still hidden:**  There were 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs in total.  So, 36 - 27 = 9 eggs are still hidden.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **Blue rope length:** The blue rope was 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.

* **Red rope length:** The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

* **Combined length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 6x - 28 = 37
    * Add 28 to both sides: 6x = 65
    * Divide both sides by 6: x = 10.83 (approximately)

* **Find the length of the red rope:** 
    * Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (10.83 - 7) = 4 * 3.83 = 15.32 (approximately)

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Figure out how much Rissa had:**

* Rissa was given thrice the amount Ronnie received, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

**2. Figure out how much money Rissa gave away:**

* Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, meaning she had 5 * (5/4) = $12.50 left.
* This means she gave away $15 - $12.50 = $2.50.

**3. Figure out how much money Ronnie had:**

* Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their sister, so Ronnie gave away $2.50.

**4. Calculate Ronnie's remaining money:**

* Ronnie had $5 and gave away $2.50, leaving him with $5 - $2.50 = $2.50.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = 15/8

3. **Therefore, Colin is currently 15/8 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Figure out how many snowballs Jay builds per minute:**

* He builds 20 snowballs per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so he builds 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowball per minute.

**2. Figure out how many snowballs melt per minute:**

* He loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, so he loses 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

**3. Calculate the net change in snowballs per minute:**

* He builds 1/3 snowball per minute and loses 2/15 snowball per minute, so he gains 1/3 - 2/15 = 1/15 snowball per minute.

**4. Determine the time to reach 60 snowballs:**

*  He gains 1/15 snowballs per minute, and he wants 60 snowballs, so it will take 60 / (1/15) = 900 minutes.

**5. Convert minutes to hours:**

* 900 minutes is equal to 900 / 60 = 15 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
    * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: S = K + 12
    * We know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: S = K + 8

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
    * Since we know S = K + 12 and S = K + 8, we can set them equal to each other: K + 12 = K + 8
    * This equation simplifies to 12 = 8, which is not possible. 

**There's an error in the problem as the information given is contradictory.** 


 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **December Price:** The price increased by 80%, so the December price was 40 * 1.80 = 72.
* **January Discount:** The price decreased by 50%, so the January price was 72 * 0.50 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of test tubes Igor should have gathered.**
* **Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered x/2 test tubes.**
* **Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes, so he gathered x/2 + 2 Petri dishes.**
* **The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes:** x/2 + x + (x/2 + 2) = 29
* **Simplify the equation:** (3x/2) + 2 = 29
* **Solve for x:** 
    * 3x/2 = 27
    * 3x = 54
    * x = 18 (This is the number of test tubes Igor should have gathered)
* **Calculate the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered:** 18/2 = 9
* **Calculate the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered:** 9 + 2 = 11
* **Calculate the number of beakers Igor lost:** 7 - (the number of beakers Igor had) = 7 - 11 = -4 

**Since Igor cannot have negative beakers, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**We know:**

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20 
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.
