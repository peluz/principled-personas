"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'q' represent the number of queens.
    * Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
    * Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know w = 2b (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
    * We also know b = 2q (There are twice as many babies as queens)

* **Solve for the number of bees:**
    * Since we know b = 2q, substitute this into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q
    * We know there are 700 bees in total, so: q + b + w = 700
    * Substitute b = 2q and w = 4q into the equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700
    * Combine like terms: 7q = 700
    * Solve for q: q = 100 
    * Now that you know q = 100, substitute it back into the equation b = 2q: b = 2 * 100 = 200
    * Finally, substitute b = 200 into the equation w = 4q: w = 4 * 100 = 400

"This is a classic example of a word problem that can be solved using basic proportions and a bit of logic. 

Here's how to approach it:

* **Find the total number of Chinese people:**  Since 240 Asians were in the race, and 80 were Japanese, there were 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese people.
* **Find the proportion of girls on the Chinese team:**  The number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.  
* **Calculate the number of girls:**  Since we know the proportion of boys to girls on the Chinese team, we can use that to find the number of girls. 

**However, there's a crucial detail missing:**  The problem doesn't tell us the proportion of girls to boys on the Chinese team. 

**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of girls on the Chinese team with the information provided.**

    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects. 


**Important Note:**  Since you can't have a fraction of an insect, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Lily likely found 14 insects.

"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**1. Calculate the discount on the shirt:**

* Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
* Discount = $25 * 0.30 = $7.50

**2. Calculate the price of the shirt after the discount:**

* Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
* Discounted Price = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

**3. Calculate the total cost of the outfit:**

* Total Cost = Shirt Price + Shorts Price
* Total Cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

**4. Calculate the sales tax:**

* We need the sales tax rate to calculate the sales tax amount.  Let's assume a standard sales tax rate of 6%.
* Sales Tax = Total Cost * Sales Tax Rate
* Sales Tax = $52.50 * 0.06 = $3.15

**5. Calculate the final price after sales tax:**

* Final Price = Total Cost + Sales Tax
* Final Price = $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65

**6. Calculate the amount of money Joe has left:**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = fragrance (same amount as zest)
    *  y = salt (same amount as sugar)
    *  z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
    *  z = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)
    *  z = 2 * x 

* **Solve for z (oil):**
    *  Since z = 2x and z = 2 * x, we can substitute to find the amount of oil. 
    *  z = 2 * x 
    *  z = 2 * x 

* **We can now use the information about the total amount of ingredients to find the amount of oil:**
    *  We know the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces. 
    *  We know the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar. 
    *  We know the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt. 

* **Therefore, we can find the amount of oil by using the information we have:**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

**Find Becca's cards:**

* Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

**Understanding Simple Interest**

Simple interest is calculated using the following formula:

* **Interest = Principal * Rate * Time**

Where:

* Principal is the initial amount of money invested.
* Rate is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
* Time is the number of years the money is invested.

**Applying the Information**

* **Principal:** $300
* **Rate:** 3/4 (or 0.75 as a decimal)
* **Time:** 3 years

**Calculation**

* Interest per year: $300 * 0.75 = $225
* Total interest earned over 3 years: $225 * 3 = $675
* Total amount after 3 years: $300 + $675 = $975

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* Melanie's age in 10 years: 18 years
* We need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be three times her current age.

**Setting up the Equation**

Let Melanie's current age be represented by 'x'.  

In 10 years, her age will be: x + 10

We know that in 10 years, her age will be thrice her present age, so:
x + 10 = 3x

**Solving for x**

* Divide both sides by 2: 5 = x

**Finding the Time**

* Melanie's current age is 5 years.
* To find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age, we need to find the time it takes for her age to reach 3 * 5 = 15 years.

**Calculating the Answer**

* Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 15 years.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points scored by all three)

**Now we can solve for Azibo's score (A):**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Combine** like terms:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the second equation into the above equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** and solve for W:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339
   2S + 4W = 347

5. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the simplified equation:
   2(S + 5) + 4W = 347

6. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   2S + 10 + 4W = 347
   2S + 4W = 337
   2S = 337 - 4W
   S = (337 - 4W) / 2

7. **Substitute** this value of S back into the equation S = 4W - 13:
   (337 - 4W) / 2 = 4W - 13

8. **Solve for W:**
   337 - 4W = 8W - 26
   363 = 12W
   W = 30.25

9. **Substitute** the value of W back into the equation S = (337 - 4W) / 2:
   S = (337 - 4 * 30.25) / 2
   S = (337 - 121) / 2
   S = 216 / 2
   S = 108

**Therefore, Stan has caught 108 Pokemon.**

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
* Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

**2. Set Up the Equation:**

* The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so the earnings from large stuffed animals are 3 * (price of small stuffed animals).
* The earnings from small stuffed animals are 4 * (number of small stuffed animals).
* The total earnings are the sum of earnings from both types of stuffed animals: 3 * (price of small stuffed animals) + 4 * (number of small stuffed animals) = $120

**3. Substitute and Solve:**

* We know the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Substitute this into the equation: 3 * ($4) + 4 * (2x) = $120
* Simplify: $12 + 8x = $120
* Subtract $12 from both sides: 8x = $108
* Divide both sides by 8: x = 13.5

**Understanding Proportional Pricing**

When prices are proportional, it means the ratio of the number of items to the price remains constant.  

* **Step 1: Find the price per sandwich for the first package.**
   The price of the first package is $3 for 2 sandwiches. So, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

**Understanding Depreciation**

Depreciation is the decrease in value of an asset over time.  It's calculated as a percentage of the original value.

**Calculation**

* **Year 2008:**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is (21/100) * $20,000 = $4,200.
* **Value after depreciation in 2008:** $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800
* **Year 2009:** The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is (21/100) * $15,800 = $3,318.
* **Value after depreciation in 2009:** $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482
* **Year 2010:** The car depreciates by 21% of $12,482, which is (21/100) * $12,482 = $2,597.
* **Value after depreciation in 2010:** $12,482 - $2,597 = $9,885

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms.** This means the T-Rex and the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Large jellyfish:**  Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and 6 jellyfish changed color, we know that 6 / (1/3) = 18 large jellyfish changed color.
* **Total large jellyfish:** Since 1/5 of the jellyfish are large, and 18 jellyfish changed color, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 18 by 5: 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish.
* **Total jellyfish:**  The total number of jellyfish in the tank is the sum of the large and small jellyfish.  We know there are 90 large jellyfish, and the rest are small and stay blue.  Therefore, the total number of jellyfish is 90 + (the number of small jellyfish). 
* **Small jellyfish:**  We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and 1/3 of the large jellyfish changed color, so the number of small jellyfish is 90 - 6 = 84.

*  Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + 12 = Camden's eggs
*  Total eggs painted: 2x + (y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for 'y' (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

*  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so y + 12 = Camden's eggs.
*  We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so y + 12 = 30.
*  Solving for 'y', we get: y = 30 - 12 = 18

**4. Solve for 'x' (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

*  We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so x = y.
*  We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted a total of 2x eggs, so 2x = 2 * 18 = 36

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

* Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple, and half is yellow, we can represent the amounts as:
    * Red = White = Purple =  x pints
    * Yellow = 1/2 * Mural size

**2.  Set up an equation:**

* The total amount of paint is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint: 
   x + x + x + (1/2) * Mural size = 12 pints

**3.  Solve for x:**

* Simplify the equation: 3x + (1/2) * Mural size = 12 pints
* We know the mural size is the total amount of paint, so we can substitute that in: 3x + (1/2) * Mural size = 12 pints
* We need to find the value of Mural size. 

**4.  Find the value of Mural size:**

* We know that half the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint is 12 pints.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by the variable ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   * (3/3)C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   * (8/3)C + 25 = 20
   * (8/3)C = -5
   * C = -5 * (3/8)
   * C = -15/8

3. **Interpret the result:**
   The answer we get is -15/8.  This doesn't make sense in the context of age.  It seems there's an error in the problem statement.  

**Conclusion:**

There is an inconsistency in the problem statement. It's impossible for Colin to be -15/8 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
* Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know that b = 3c - 2 (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)
* We also know that each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

**3. Solve for the number of cupcakes:**

* We need to find the value of 'c'.  We can use the equation b = 3c - 2 and substitute it into the total treats equation:
   * 10 = 5 * 2  (since each person gets 2 treats)
   * 10 = 10 
   * This tells us that the total number of treats is correct.

* Now, we can use the equation b = 3c - 2 to find the number of brownies:
   * b = 3c - 2
   * We know that b is equal to the number of brownies, so we can substitute the value of 'b' from the total treats equation:
   * 10 = 5 * 2
   * 10 = 10
   * This tells us that the total number of treats is correct.

* We can now use the equation b = 3c - 2 to find the number of brownies:
   * b = 3c - 2
   * We know that b is equal to the number of brownies, so we can substitute the value of 'b' from the total treats equation:
   * 10 = 5 * 2
   * 10 = 10
   * This tells us that the total number of treats is correct.

**4.  Solve for 'c' (the number of cupcakes):**

* We know that b = 3c - 2
* We also know that b = 10
* Substitute the value of 'b' into the equation:
   * 10 = 3c - 2
   * 12 = 3c
   * c = 4

    * We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: S = K + 12
    * We know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: S = K + 8

* **Solve for Shelley (S):**  Since we know S = K + 12 and S = K + 8, we can set these two equations equal to each other:
    * K + 12 = K + 8

* **Solve for Kim (K):**  Subtract K from both sides:

    *  Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    *  He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    *  The total number of items is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.  We can substitute the values we know into the equation: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    *  Simplify: 24 + beakers = 29
    *  Solve for beakers: beakers = 29 - 24 = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.
