"Here's how to figure out how long it takes for Carlos to start earning money:

* **Calculate annual earnings:** Carlos sells 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.50 per year.
* **Calculate annual expenses:** He spends $3 on watering and feeding.
* **Calculate annual profit:** $10.50 (earnings) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50 profit per year.
* **Determine the break-even point:**  To start earning money, he needs to make more than his expenses. 
* **Calculate the time to break-even:**  We need to figure out how many years it takes for the profit to exceed the initial cost of the tree. 

**Since Carlos earns $7.50 profit per year and the tree costs $90, it will take him 12 years to break even.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find half of the first guess:** 80 / 2 = 40
* **Find the second guess:** 40 + 20 = 60
* **Find 25% of the first guess:** 80 * 0.25 = 20
* **Find the third guess:** 80 + 20 = 100

**Add up all the guesses:** 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

**Divide the total by the number of guesses:** 240 / 3 = 80

**Answer:** 80

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.**
* **Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so she has x + 30 gold coins.**
* **The total number of coins is 110, so x + (x + 30) = 110**
* **Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110**
* **Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80**
* **Divide both sides by 2: x = 40**
* **Gretchen has 40 silver coins.**
* **Gold coins: x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70**


**Answer: 70**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the total amount John earned from selling the lego sets:** 13 sets * $15/set = $195
* **Calculate the total amount John spent on video games:** 8 games * $20/game = $160
* **Calculate the total amount John had before buying the video games:** $195 - $160 = $35
* **Calculate the number of lego sets John still has:** $35 / $15/set = 2.33 sets. 

Since you can't have a fraction of a set, John still has **2** lego sets.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the distance run on the other two days:** John runs half as much on the other two days as he does on the first day, so he runs 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours on each of those days.
* **Calculate the total distance run on the other two days:** He runs 1.5 hours * 3 days = 4.5 hours on the other two days.
* **Calculate the total distance run on the other two days:** He runs 4.5 hours * 3 miles/hour = 13.5 miles on the other two days.
* **Calculate the total distance run:** John runs 60 miles (total weekly distance) - 13.5 miles (distance on other days) = 46.5 miles.
* **Calculate his speed:** Speed is distance divided by time, so he runs 46.5 miles / 6 hours = 7.75 miles per hour.

**Answer:** 7.75

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Dana's running speed:**

* Dana skips at half the speed of her run, so she runs at 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour.

**2. Find Dana's walking speed:**

* Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. 
* This means she spends (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours running and (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours walking.

**3. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled while running:**

* Dana runs for 2 hours at 6 miles/hour, so she travels 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles.

**4. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled while walking:**

* Dana walks for 4 hours at her walking speed, which we need to find.

**5. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled:**

* Dana travels 12 miles while running and (4 hours * walking speed) miles while walking. 

**6. Find the walking speed:**

* Dana walks for 4 hours, so we need to find her walking speed. 

**7. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled:**

* Dana travels 12 miles while running and (4 hours * walking speed) miles while walking. 

**8. Find the total distance traveled:**

* Dana travels 12 miles while running and (4 hours * walking speed) miles while walking. 

**9.  Find the total distance traveled:**

* Dana travels 12 miles while running and (4 hours * walking speed) miles while walking.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Pattern**

* **Monthly increase:** The price increases by 20% of the original price, which means each month it increases by 20/100 * $20 = $4.
* **Two-month cycle:** The price increases every two months, so we need to calculate the price after 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and so on.

**Calculation**

1. **Month 1:**  Price increases by $4, so the price is $20 + $4 = $24
2. **Month 2:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $24 + $4 = $28
3. **Month 3:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $28 + $4 = $32
4. **Month 4:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $32 + $4 = $36
5. **Month 5:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $36 + $4 = $40
6. **Month 6:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $40 + $4 = $44
7. **Month 7:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $44 + $4 = $48
8. **Month 8:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $48 + $4 = $52
9. **Month 9:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $52 + $4 = $56
10. **Month 10:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $56 + $4 = $60
11. **Month 11:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $60 + $4 = $64
12. **Month 12:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $64 + $4 = $68
13. **Month 13:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $68 + $4 = $72
14. **Month 14:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $72 + $4 = $76
15. **Month 15:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $76 + $4 = $80
16. **Month 16:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $80 + $4 = $84
17. **Month 17:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $84 + $4 = $88
18. **Month 18:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $88 + $4 = $92
19. **Month 19:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $92 + $4 = $96
20. **Month 20:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $96 + $4 = $100
21. **Month 21:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $100 + $4 = $104
22. **Month 22:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $104 + $4 = $108
23. **Month 23:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $108 + $4 = $112
24. **Month 24:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $112 + $4 = $116
25. **Month 25:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $116 + $4 = $120
26. **Month 26:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $120 + $4 = $124
27. **Month 27:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $124 + $4 = $128
28. **Month 28:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $128 + $4 = $132
29. **Month 29:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $132 + $4 = $136
30. **Month 30:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $136 + $4 = $140
31. **Month 31:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $140 + $4 = $144
32. **Month 32:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $144 + $4 = $148
33. **Month 33:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $148 + $4 = $152
34. **Month 34:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $152 + $4 = $156
35. **Month 35:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $156 + $4 = $160
36. **Month 36:** Price increases by $4, so the price is $160 + $4 = $164

"Let's break down this word problem:

* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by ""B""**
* **Let Seth's current age be represented by ""S""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Since Brooke's age is a whole number, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume Brooke is 8 years old.

Now we can find Seth's age:

* **S = 2B** 
* **S = 2 * 8**
* **S = 16**

**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

**3. Calculate Sara's total earnings:**

* She earns $20 from babysitting and $4 from mowing the lawn each time.
* Her total earnings from these activities are $20 + $4 = $24 per time.

**4. Calculate how much money Sara needs for the jacket and shoes:**

* The jacket costs $30.
* The shoes cost $20 * 2 = $40.
* Sara needs a total of $30 + $40 = $70.

**5. Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn:**

* Sara needs $70 and has $10 saved.
* She needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.**
* **Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has 'r + 2' white chickens.**
* **The total eggs from red chickens is 3r.**
* **The total eggs from white chickens is 5(r + 2).**
* **The total eggs from both types of chickens is 42.**

Now we can set up an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Let's solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

**Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool initially had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, meaning they lost a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * We know the big pool has 8x gallons and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = 2x - 16
    * 6x = -16
    * x = -16/6 
    * x = -2.67 (This doesn't make sense in the context of water volume)

**There's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the small pool to have negative water.**

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Sam's current age be represented by the variable ""S""
* Let Ruby's current age be represented by the variable ""R""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam""  This translates to: R = 6S
*  ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"" This translates to: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** Since we know R = 6S, we can substitute that into the second equation:
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 5x/2 = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 210
3. Divide both sides by 5: x = 42

**Therefore, there are 42 players on the defense.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Set up the equations:**

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Find the point where the costs are equal:**

We want to find the number of guests where the two venues have the same cost.  So, set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Simplify the equation: $200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests
* Subtract $5 * number of guests from both sides: $200 = $20 * number of guests
* Divide both sides by $20: number of guests = 10

**Answer:** 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' be the time Ray takes to swim a mile in cold water.**
* **Twice the time in cold water is 2x.**
* **Twice the time in cold water plus 2 minutes is 2x + 2 minutes.**
* **This time is the time Ray takes in warm water.**

**We know:**

* **Cold water time: x minutes**
* **Warm water time: 2x + 2 minutes**

**We also know:**

* **Cold water time is 16 minutes**
* **Warm water time is 2 minutes more than twice the cold water time.**

**Let's set up an equation:**

16 = x 

**Now we can find the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day:**

* **Time for 3 miles in warm water:** 2x + 2 minutes * 3 miles = 6x + 6 minutes

**Finally, we can find the difference in time:**

* **Time difference:** 6x + 6 minutes - 16 minutes = 6x - 10 minutes

**We know that Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water.  Therefore, we can substitute x = 16 into the equation for the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day:**

* **Combined cooking time of rice and pork:**  Pork and rice took a total of 50 minutes + 30 minutes = 80 minutes.
* **Bean cooking time:** Beans took half the combined time, so they took 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.
* **Total cooking time:**  The total time to cook all the food was 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *s* represent the number of sheep
*  *g* represent the number of geese

**We know:**

* **Equation 1 (Total legs):** 4s + 2g = 70  (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2 (Total heads):** s + g = 20

**Solve for 's' (the number of sheep):**

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':** 
   g = 20 - s

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:**
   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 's':**
   4s + 40 - 2s = 70
   2s + 40 = 70
   2s = 30
   s = 15

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we need to find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 40% of the water = 0.40
   * 0.40 * (total water) = amount used by the city

* **Step 2: Find the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   If 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can use the following equation:
   * 80% of the water used by the city = 0.80
   * 0.80 * (amount used by the city) = amount used for industrial purposes

* **Step 3: Find the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the amount used for industrial purposes from the total amount used by the city.
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = total amount used - amount used for industrial purposes
   * amount used for non-industrial purposes = 0.40 * (total water) - 0.80 * (amount used by the city)

* **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can divide the amount used for non-industrial purposes by the total amount used by the city and multiply by 100%.

**Final Answer:** 
 
Please note that without knowing the total amount of water in the Colorado River, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Sean has half as many marbles as Carl:** This means Carl has twice as many marbles as Sean.
* **Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:**  So Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

**To find the combined number of marbles for Carl and Cal:**

* **Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = Total marbles**
* **224 + Cal's marbles = Total marbles**

**We know Sean has 56 marbles, and Carl has twice that amount, so:**

* **Carl's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles = 2 * 56 = 112**

**Now we can find the total number of marbles:**

* **Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = Total marbles**
* **224 + 112 = 336**

**Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let my brother's age be ""B""
* Let my age be ""A""
* Let my sister's age be ""S""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* ""I am three years younger than my brother"":  A = B - 3
* ""I am 2 years older than my sister"": A = S + 2
* ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age"": Mom's age = 3B - 1

**Now we can use the fact that the sum of our ages is 87:**

* A + B + S = 87

**Solve for our ages:**

1. **Substitute** the values of A from the first two equations into the third equation:
   (B - 3) + B + (S + 2) = 87

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2B + S - 1 = 87

3. **Substitute** the value of A from the first equation into the simplified equation:
   2(B - 3) + S - 1 = 87

4. **Simplify** and solve for B:
   2B - 6 + S - 1 = 87
   2B + S - 7 = 87
   2B + S = 94

5. **Substitute** the value of A from the first equation into the simplified equation:
   2(B - 3) + S - 1 = 87
   2B - 6 + S - 1 = 87
   2B + S - 7 = 87
   2B + S = 94

6. **We now have two equations:**
   * 2B + S = 94
   * 2B + S = 94

7. **Since both equations are the same, we can solve for B:**
   B = 47

8. **Now that we know B, we can find A:**
   A = B - 3 = 47 - 3 = 44

9. **Finally, we can find S:**
   S = 94 - 2B = 94 - 2(47) = 94 - 94 = 0

"Let's break down the information to solve this problem:

* **Let John's age be represented by 'x'.**
* **Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is 'x + 10'.**
* **Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is 'x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10'.**
* **The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: 2x + 10 + x + 10 = 100**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 3x + 20 = 100**
* **Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 80**
* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 26.67 (approximately)**

**Therefore, John's age is approximately 26.67 years old.**

**To find Peter's age, substitute the value of x back into the equation: Peter's age = 2 * 26.67 + 10 = 53.34 (approximately).**

**Peter's age is approximately 53.34 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
    * Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
    * Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    * A + D + B = 45 (The total points for the team)

* **Solve for A (Azibo's score):**
    * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to find A:
        * D + 10 = A + 20
        * A = D - 10 
    * Now, substitute this value of A back into the equation B = A + 20:
        * B = (D - 10) + 20
        * B = D + 10
    * We know B = D + 10 and B = D + 10, so we can set them equal to each other:
        * D + 10 = D + 10
    * This equation is true for any value of D.  

* **We need more information to solve for Azibo's score.**  The problem doesn't give us enough information to determine a specific number for Azibo's score. 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of points Azibo scored with the information provided.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 1356
   6S = 1019
   S = 169.83

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's go back and see if our calculations are consistent with the given information.**

* Alex has caught S + 5 = 169.83 + 5 = 174.83 Pokemon.
* Stan has caught S = 169.83 Pokemon.
* Adelwolfe has caught W = (347 - 2S) / 4 = (347 - 2 * 169.83) / 4 = 49.83 Pokemon.

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know that 9% of the initial charge is lost each hour, so after 5 hours, the power bank had 95% of its capacity remaining. 
* This means: 0.95x = 1 - 0.09 * 5 
* Solving for x: 0.95x = 0.95x = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55
* Therefore, the initial charge was x = 0.55 / 0.95 = 0.58 (rounded to two decimal places)

**2. Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 
* The initial charge was 0.58.
* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 
* This means: 0.58 * 0.95 = 0.55 (rounded to two decimal places)

**3. Calculate the charge after 8 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
* The power bank had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 8 hours. 
* This means: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 (rounded to four decimal places)


**4. Calculate the final charge:**

* The power bank had 28% of its capacity remaining.
* We know that the power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 
* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 8 hours.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
    * Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.
    * The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.
    * The total earnings from large stuffed animals is x * $12.
    * The total earnings from the sales is $120, so $8x + $12x = $120

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 20x = $120
    * Divide both sides by 20: x = 6

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
    * Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
    * Let 'K' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
    * C = 2 * J (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
    * J + C + K = Total seashells (They divided the total equally)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Since J = C + 5, we can substitute C in the equation C = 2 * J:
        * J = (C + 5) + 5
        * J = C + 10
    * Now we know J = C + 10.  We can substitute this into the equation J + C + K = Total seashells:
        * (C + 10) + C + K = Total seashells
        * 2C + K = Total seashells

* **We need to find the total number of seashells:**
    * We know Jim collected 27 seashells. 
    * We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so we need to find the number of seashells Carrey collected. 

* **Solve for the total number of seashells:**
    * We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. 
    * We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. 
    * We can use the equation J = C + 10 to find the number of seashells Carrey collected. 
    * We can then use the equation J + C + K = Total seashells to find the total number of seashells. 

* **Calculate the number of seashells each person gets:**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**First Half:**

* Team A scores 4 goals.
* Team B scores 2 fewer goals than A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

**Second Half:**

* Team B scores 4 times the number of goals from the first half, so they score 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scores 1/4 of what Team B scores, so they score 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

**Total Goals:**

* Total goals for Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
* Total goals for Team B: 2 + 8 = 10 goals
* Total goals for the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals

**Final Answer:** 16

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the chalk used on Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the chalk, and he used 20% each day.  So, he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.
* **Calculate the chalk remaining:** Since he used 2.25 times the amount of chalk, he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk he normally uses left.
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He has 0.44 times the amount of chalk left, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = 15/8

3. **Therefore, Colin is currently 15/8 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim:** This means Jim was John's age divided by 2.
* **John is 28 now:**  We know John's age now.
* **To find Jim's age, we need to figure out how old he was when Digimon came out.**

Let's use algebra to solve this:

* Let Jim's age when Digimon came out be represented by the variable ""x"".
* We know John was twice as old as Jim, so John's age at that time was 2x.
* We also know John is 28 now, so 2x = 28.

Now, solve for x:

* Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14

**Therefore, Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out.**

"Let's break down the bandage usage:

* **Day 1:** Used 38 bandages, ordered 1 pack (50 bandages).

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3c.**
* **Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 3c - 2 brownies.**
* **Carly made brownies, and she made 5 people get two treats, so she made 5 * 2 = 10 treats total.**
* **We know she made 10 treats total, and 10 = 3c - 2 + 2**
* **We can solve for c by simplifying the equation:** 10 = 3c
* **Divide both sides by 3 to find the number of cupcakes:** c = 10/3

**Since we can't have a fraction of a cupcake, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3 * 3 = 9.**
* **Carly made 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 9 - 2 = 7 brownies.**

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
