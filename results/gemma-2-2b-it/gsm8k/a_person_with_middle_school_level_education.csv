"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**2.  Find the Unit Value:**

*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
*  The ratio is 7:13, so we need to find out how many cups of water are represented by 120 teaspoons.

**3.  Set up a Proportion:**

Let 'x' be the number of cups of water.  We can set up a proportion:

7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

**4. Solve for x:**

* Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
* Simplify: 7x = 1560
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups (approximately)

**5. Calculate the Number of Teaspoons of Sugar:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* The ratio is 7:13, so we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by using the ratio.

**6.  Final Calculation:**

*  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the number of cups of water by the ratio. 
*  We know that 120 teaspoons of sugar is represented by 13 cups of water. 
*  Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar is 120 teaspoons of sugar / 13 cups of water * 7 teaspoons of sugar per 13 cups of water = 70 teaspoons of sugar.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = 2b (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
   * We also know b = 2q (There are twice as many babies as queens)

* **Solve for the number of worker bees (w):**
   * Since b = 2q, we can substitute that into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) 
   * Simplify: w = 4q

* **We need to find the value of 'q' to get the number of worker bees (w).**  We know there are 700 bees in total.  

* **Use the information about the total number of bees:**
   *  q + b + w = 700
   *  q + (2q) + (4q) = 700
   *  7q = 700
   *  q = 100

* **Now that we know q (the number of queens), we can find w (the number of worker bees):**

**Understanding the Problem**

* The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price is increasing by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months.

**Calculations**

* **Month 1:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4.  The new price is $20 + $4 = $24.
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. The new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is $5.76. The new price is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is $6.91. The new price is $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47.
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is $8.29. The new price is $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76.
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is $9.95. The new price is $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71.
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is $11.94. The new price is $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65.
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is $14.33. The new price is $71.65 + $14.33 = $86.98.
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $86.98, which is $17.40. The new price is $86.98 + $17.40 = $104.38.
* **Month 10:** The price increases by 20% of $104.38, which is $20.88. The new price is $104.38 + $20.88 = $125.26.
* **Month 11:** The price increases by 20% of $125.26, which is $25.05. The new price is $125.26 + $25.05 = $150.31.
* **Month 12:** The price increases by 20% of $150.31, which is $30.06. The new price is $150.31 + $30.06 = $180.37.
* **Month 13:** The price increases by 20% of $180.37, which is $36.07. The new price is $180.37 + $36.07 = $216.44.
* **Month 14:** The price increases by 20% of $216.44, which is $43.28. The new price is $216.44 + $43.28 = $260.72.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = r + 2 (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
   * We know the total eggs from red and white chickens is 42: 3r + 5w = 42

* **Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**
   * Substitute the value of 'w' from the first equation into the second equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   * Simplify: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   * Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42
   * Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Oven heating:** The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.  It raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, so it adds 180 * 5 = 900 degrees.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Set up equations:**

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Find when the costs are equal:**

We want to find the number of guests where the two venues have the same cost.  So, we set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

**Answer:** 8 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 'b - 0.01b' red jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 'b + 0.01b' green jelly beans.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 
b + (b - 0.01b) + (b + 0.01b) = 4500

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 3b + 0.02b = 4500
* Simplify: 3.02b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 3.02: b = 1490

**Find the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: b + 0.01b = 1490 + 0.01 * 1490 = 1490.1
* Red jelly beans: b - 0.01b = 1490 - 0.01 * 1490 = 1490 - 14.9 = 1475.1

**Answer:** The jar contains 1475.1 - 1490 = **-14.9** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know she uses 10 ounces of the mixture.

* **Solve for the amount of oil (o):**
    *  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    *  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x

        2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339
    * Simplify and solve for W:
        8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
        9W - 21 = 339
        9W = 360
        W = 40 (Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon)

* **Now that we know W, we can find S:**
    * S = 4W - 13
    * S = 4(40) - 13
    * S = 160 - 13
    * S = 147 (Stan caught 147 Pokemon)

**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.
* **Total time for Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

**Answer:** 2

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Father's gift:** Adam's father gave him twice the amount his mother gave him, so he gave him $6 * 2 = $12.
* **Total from parents:** Adam received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.
* **Adam's savings:**  Adam spent $30 - $18 = $12 of his savings.

**Answer:** $12

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.

2. **Calculate Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, and we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  Let's represent Wilfred's age with the variable 'x'.  We can write the equation:

   (3 + 4 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20

4. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to:

   (7 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20

   7 + Helene's age + x = 80

   Helene's age + x = 73

5. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute Helene's age from the previous step into this equation.

   Helene's age + x = 73

   2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4 = 73

   2 * (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age + 73) / 4 = 73

   2 * (79 + Wilfred's age) / 4 = 73

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour.
* Over 5 hours, it loses 9% * 5 = 45% of its charge.

**2. Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank started with 100% charge.
* After losing 45%, it had 100% - 45% = 55% charge.

**3. Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour.
* Over 3 hours, it loses 7% * 3 = 21% of its charge.

**4. Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank had 55% charge after the first 5 hours.
* After losing 21%, it had 55% - 21% = 34% charge.

**5. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank ended with 28% charge.
* We know it lost 34% after 3 hours, so it had 28% + 34% = 62% charge before the 3 hours.

**6. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours.
* The power bank had 100% - 45% = 55% charge after the first 5 hours.
* The power bank lost 21% of its charge in the next 3 hours.
* The power bank had 55% - 21% = 34% charge after the next 3 hours.
* The power bank had 34% charge after the next 3 hours.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's figure out how much Teresa earned from large stuffed animals:**
   * Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, and she earned $120 total, let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. 
   * She sold 2x small stuffed animals.
   * The earnings from large stuffed animals are 3 * (price of small stuffed animals) * (number of small stuffed animals)
   * This is equal to 3 * $4 * 2x = $24x

* **Set up an equation:**
   * We know the total earnings are $120, so: $24x + $24x = $120

* **Solve for x:**
   * Combine like terms: $48x = $120
   * Divide both sides by 48: x = 2.5

* **Since we can't sell fractions of stuffed animals, there must be an error in the problem.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.
* Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry has 'x + 60' feet.

**2. Set up an equation:**

* The total length of fence is 100 feet: x + (x + 60) = 100

**3. Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100
* Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

**4. Find how much fence Sam has:**

* Sam has 20 feet of fence.

**5. Find how much fence Harry has:**

* Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.

**6. Find how much fence is left for Sam:**

* Sam has 100 - 80 = 20 feet of fence left.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
   * The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
   * The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4 * (y - 7)' centimeters long.

* **Set up an equation:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: 
   y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve for y:**
   * Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
   * Simplify: 6y - 35 = 37
   * Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72
   * Divide both sides by 6: y = 12

* **Find the length of the yellow rope:** y = 12 centimeters

* **Find the length of the red rope:** 
   * Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be ""c""
* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""

**Set up equations based on the information given:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: c + 25 = (1/3)(w + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute that into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5(c + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35 + 25)
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 60)
   c + 25 = (5c/3) + 20
   (3c + 75) = 5c + 60
   3c - 5c = 60 - 75
   -2c = -15
   c = 7.5

**Answer:** Colin is currently 7.5 years old. 
 
**Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7.5**
