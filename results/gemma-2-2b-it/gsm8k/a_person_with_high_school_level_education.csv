"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

* **Green house:** Melanie sold (1/3)x 
* **Red house:** She sold 2 more than the green house, so she sold (1/3)x + 2
* **Orange house:** She sold half of what was left, so she sold (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2)

* **Total sold:**  (1/3)x + (1/3)x + 2 + (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5

* **Simplify and solve for x:**
    * (2/3)x + 2 + (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5
    * (2/3)x + 2 + (1/2) * ( (2/3)x - 2) = 5
    * (2/3)x + 2 + (1/3)x - 1 = 5
    * (5/3)x + 1 = 5
    * (5/3)x = 4
    * x = 4 * (3/5)
    * x = 12

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the distance of the remaining miles:**

* Marissa has already hiked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
* The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

**2. Calculate the time she needs to walk the remaining distance:**

* Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 6 miles / Speed

**3. Set up an equation to find the speed:**

* Total time = Time for first 4 miles + Time for next 2 miles + Time for remaining distance

* **Year 1:**  Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of $600, so she gets $600 * 1.10 = $660.
* **Year 2:** Her salary increases by 10% of $660, so she gets $660 * 1.10 = $726.
* **Year 3:** Her salary increases by 10% of $726, so she gets $726 * 1.10 = $798.60.

**Total increase:** $660 + $726 + $798.60 = $2184.60

**Sylvie's salary after three more years:** $600 + $2184.60 = **$2784.60**

* **We need to find the value of 'q' to get the number of worker bees:**
   * We know there are 700 bees in total. 
   * So, q + b + w = 700
   * Substitute b = 2q and w = 4q: q + 2q + 4q = 700
   * Combine like terms: 7q = 700
   * Solve for q: q = 100

* **Calculate the number of worker bees (w):**
   * w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

**Understanding the Problem**

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price is increasing by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months.

**Calculations**

* **Month 1:**  The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. 
   * New price: $20 + $4 = $24
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80
   * New price: $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is $5.76
   * New price: $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is $6.91
   * New price: $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is $8.29
   * New price: $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is $9.95
   * New price: $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is $11.94
   * New price: $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is $14.33
   * New price: $71.65 + $14.33 = $86.98
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $86.98, which is $17.40
   * New price: $86.98 + $17.40 = $104.38
* **Month 10:** The price increases by 20% of $104.38, which is $20.88
   * New price: $104.38 + $20.88 = $125.26
* **Month 11:** The price increases by 20% of $125.26, which is $25.05
   * New price: $125.26 + $25.05 = $150.31
* **Month 12:** The price increases by 20% of $150.31, which is $30.06
   * New price: $150.31 + $30.06 = $180.37

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let Seth's current age be ""S""**
* **Let Brooke's current age be ""B""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**

* **Let's represent the number of students in each of the equal groups:**  Let's say each of the equal groups has 'x' students.

* **The size of the smallest group:** The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

* **Total students:** The total number of students is 3x + (x - 10) = 200

* **Solve for x:** 4x - 10 = 200
   * 4x = 210
   * x = 52.5

* **The smallest group:** Since we can't have half a student, there must be an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to have groups with this specific size. 


**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know that c + w = 60 (The total number of animals)
* We know that c = 2w (He has twice as many chickens as cows)

**Solve for the number of cows (w):**

1. Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2. Combine like terms: 3w = 60
3. Divide both sides by 3: w = 20 

**Solve for the number of chickens (c):**

* c = 2 * w = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculate the total number of legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Total legs: 80 + 80 = 160

**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests 

**2.  Find the point where the costs are equal:**

We want to find the number of guests where the cost of Venue 1 equals the cost of Venue 2.  So, set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

**Answer:** 8 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**

    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = fragrance (same amount as zest)
    *  y = salt (same amount as sugar)
    *  z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
    *  z = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)
    *  z = 2 * x 

* **Solve for z (oil):**
    *  Since z = 2x, and x = fragrance, we can substitute to find z:
        * z = 2 * x 
        * z = 2 * x

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let your age be represented by ""x""
* Your brother's age is ""x + 3"" (3 years younger than you)
* Your sister's age is ""x - 2"" (2 years older than you)
* Your mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1"" (one less than three times your brother's age)

**Set up an equation:**

The sum of your ages is 87: 
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: 
   5x + 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
2. Simplify:
   8x + 10 = 87
3. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   8x = 77
4. Divide both sides by 8:
   x = 9.625

**Find your age:**

Since you can't have a fraction of a year, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume the problem meant to say your mom's age is ""three times your brother's age minus 1"". 

**Here's how the problem would work if that was the case:**

* Your brother's age is ""x + 3""
* Your sister's age is ""x - 2""
* Your mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1""

**Set up the equation:**

The sum of your ages is 87:
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms:
   5x + 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
2. Simplify:

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J by substituting the second equation into the first equation. 

* **Solve for J:**
    *  Since we know that P = P + 10 + J, we can substitute this into the equation 2P + J = 100.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* A + S + W = 339 (They have a total of 339 Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Combine** like terms:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the above equation:
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40 

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the third equation to find S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

6. **Finally, substitute the value of S back into the first equation to find A:**
   A + 147 + W = 339
   A + 147 + 40 = 339
   A + 187 = 339
   A = 152

**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it lost 9% * 5 hours = 45% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%

**2. Calculate the charge after 8 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its charge for 3 hours, so it lost 7% * 3 hours = 21% of its charge.
* The remaining charge after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%

**3. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.
* We can use the following equation to find the initial charge: 28% = (Initial Charge) * (1 - 0.09) ^ 8 
* Solving for the initial charge, we get: Initial Charge = 28% / (1 - 0.09)^8

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
    * Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.
    * The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.
    * The total earnings from large stuffed animals is x * $12.
    * The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120.  So, $8x + $12x = $120

* **Solve for x:**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4 * (y - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2. Simplify: 6y - 35 = 37
3. Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72
4. Divide both sides by 6: y = 12 

**Find the length of the yellow rope:**

The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

**Find the length of the blue rope:**

The blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.

**Find the length of the red rope:**

The red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 28 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 28 centimeters.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the amount of each color:** Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, and the mural has 12 pints total, each color represents 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.
* **Calculate the amount of yellow paint:** Half the mural is yellow, so it uses 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.
* **Find the amount of red paint:**  The red, white, and purple paint combined represent 3 pints each, and the yellow paint represents 6 pints.  The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3 pints * 3 colors = 9 pints.  The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 9 pints - 6 pints = 3 pints.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute that into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   (3/3)C + 25 - (5/3)C = 20
   (8/3)C + 25 = 20
   (8/3)C = -5
   C = -5 * (3/8)
   C = -15/8

3. **Interpret the result:** 
   The answer is -15/8.  However, age cannot be negative. This means there's an error in the problem setup. It's likely there's a mistake in the given information. 


**Final Answer:**  There is an error in the problem.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can use a system of equations to solve for 'c'.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5
