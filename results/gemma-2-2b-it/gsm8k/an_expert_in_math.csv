"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of one red tie:**

* Since blue ties cost $40 each, and red ties cost 50% more, let's represent the cost of one blue tie as 'x'.
* The cost of one red tie is then 'x + (50/100)x = 1.5x'.

**2. Calculate the number of blue ties:**

* John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

**3. Calculate the cost of the red ties:**

* Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.
* The cost of the red ties is 10 * 1.5x = 15x.

**4. Calculate the total cost:**

* The total cost of the blue ties is 5 * 40 = $200.
* The total cost of the red ties is 15x.
* Therefore, the total cost is 200 + 15x.

**5. Solve for x:**

* We know that the total cost is $200, so 200 + 15x = 200.
* Subtracting 200 from both sides, we get 15x = 0.
* Dividing both sides by 15, we get x = 0.

**6. Calculate the cost of the red ties:**

* Since x represents the cost of one blue tie, the cost of the red ties is 15 * 0 = $0.

**7. Final Answer:**

* John spent $0 on red ties.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * He wants to make twice as many this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.
    * He baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
    * He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 10 = 110
    * 2x = 100
    * x = 50

**Answer:** Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

**Therefore, there were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price increases by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months.

**Calculations**

* **Month 1:**  The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. 
   * New price: $20 + $4 = $24
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80
   * New price: $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is $5.76
   * New price: $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is $6.91
   * New price: $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is $8.29
   * New price: $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is $9.95
   * New price: $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is $11.94
   * New price: $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is $14.33
   * New price: $71.65 + $14.33 = $86.98
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $86.98, which is $17.39
   * New price: $86.98 + $17.39 = $104.37
* **Month 10:** The price increases by 20% of $104.37, which is $20.87
   * New price: $104.37 + $20.87 = $125.24
* **Month 11:** The price increases by 20% of $125.24, which is $25.05
   * New price: $125.24 + $25.05 = $150.29
* **Month 12:** The price increases by 20% of $150.29, which is $30.06
   * New price: $150.29 + $30.06 = $180.35
* **Month 13:** The price increases by 20% of $180.35, which is $36.07
   * New price: $180.35 + $36.07 = $216.42
* **Month 14:** The price increases by 20% of $216.42, which is $43.28
   * New price: $216.42 + $43.28 = $260.70
* **Month 15:** The price increases by 20% of $260.70, which is $52.14
   * New price: $260.70 + $52.14 = $312.84
* **Month 16:** The price increases by 20% of $312.84, which is $62.57
   * New price: $312.84 + $62.57 = $375.41
* **Month 17:** The price increases by 20% of $375.41, which is $75.08
   * New price: $375.41 + $75.08 = $450.49
* **Month 18:** The price increases by 20% of $450.49, which is $90.09
   * New price: $450.49 + $90.09 = $540.58
* **Month 19:** The price increases by 20% of $540.58, which is $108.11
   * New price: $540.58 + $108.11 = $648.69
* **Month 20:** The price increases by 20% of $648.69, which is $129.73
   * New price: $648.69 + $129.73 = $778.42
* **Month 21:** The price increases by 20% of $778.42, which is $155.68
   * New price: $778.42 + $155.68 = $934.10
* **Month 22:** The price increases by 20% of $934.10, which is $186.82
   * New price: $934.10 + $186.82 = $1120.92
* **Month 23:** The price increases by 20% of $1120.92, which is $224.18

* **Month 24:** The price increases by 20% of $1345.10, which is $269.02
   * New price: $1345.10 + $269.02 = $1614.12
* **Month 25:** The price increases by 20% of $1614.12, which is $322.82
   * New price: $1614.12 + $322.82 = $1936.94
* **Month 26:** The price increases by 20% of $1936.94, which is $387.39
   * New price: $1936.94 + $387.39 = $2324.33

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know that r + w = total chickens 
* We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
* We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.

**3. Formulate equations based on the given information:**

*  3r + 5w = 42  (total eggs from red and white chickens)
*  r = w + 2   (two more white chickens than red chickens)

**4. Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

* Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
* Simplify: 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* Combine like terms: 8w + 6 = 42
* Subtract 6 from both sides: 8w = 36
* Divide both sides by 8: w = 4.5 
* Since we can't have half a chicken, this means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to have a number of chickens that produces a whole number of eggs.

"Here's how to solve this word problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Sam's current age be represented by the variable ""S""
* Let Ruby's current age be represented by the variable ""R""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam""  This translates to: R = 6S
*  ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"" This translates to: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** Since we know R = 6S, we can substitute that into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   * 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   * 3S = 18
   * S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Noah's current age:**

* Cera is 46 years old, and six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so we can set up the equation: 3000 * Noah's age = population of Chile six years ago.
* We know the population of Chile six years ago was half the current population, so we can write: 3000 * Noah's age = (current population of Chile) / 2

**2. Find Noah's age six years ago:**

* We know Cera's age six years ago was 40 years old.

**3. Find the current population of Chile:**

* We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. 
* We also know Noah's age six years ago was 40 years old.
* We can use this information to find the current population of Chile.

**4. Calculate the current population of Chile:**

*  Let's call the current population of Chile ""P"".
*  We know that the population six years ago was 3000 * Noah's age, which is 3000 * 40 = 120,000.
*  The population of Chile six years ago was half the current population, so P/2 = 120,000.
*  Solving for P, we get P = 120,000 * 2 = 240,000.

**Therefore, the population of Chile now is 240,000.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is the sum of the players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

* **Combine like terms:** (3/2)x + x = 105

* **Solve for x:** (5/2)x = 105
   * Multiply both sides by (2/5): x = 42

"Here's how to solve this:

**Understanding the Problem**

* The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
* We need to find the time it takes to charge from 60% to 100%.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate the remaining charge:**  The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of 40% (100% - 60%).

2. **Determine the time needed for the remaining charge:**  
   * Since the phone charges 1% per 3 minutes, we need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to charge 40%.
   *  40% / 1% per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

3. **Convert minutes to hours:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
* He has 12.8 hectares left.

**2.  Represent the Unknown:**

* Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

**3. Set up the Equation:**

*  (3/5)x =  The amount of land sold
*  x - (3/5)x = The amount of land remaining
*  12.8 = x - (3/5)x

**4. Solve for x:**

* Find a common denominator for the fractions: 12.8 = (5/5)x - (3/5)x
* Combine the fractions: 12.8 = (2/5)x
* Multiply both sides by (5/2): 12.8 * (5/2) = x
* Simplify: 32 = x

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let Jerry's current age be represented by ""x"".**

* **Five years ago, Jerry was x - 5 years old.**

* **The problem states: ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.""**  This translates to the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

* **Now we can solve for x:**
    * x = 2x - 10

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we want to find the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we need to find the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes.

* **Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes.

* **Step 3: Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following formula:

   Non-industrial water usage = Total water usage * (1 - Industrial water usage)

   Non-industrial water usage = 40% * (1 - 80%) = 40% * 20% = 8%

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

**Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

**Find Becca's cards:**

* Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
* Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
* Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points scored by all three)

**Now we can solve for A (Azibo's score):**

1. **Substitute the values of B from the first two equations into the third equation:**
   A + D + (A + 20) = 45

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   2A + D + 20 = 45

3. **Substitute the value of B from the first equation into the simplified equation:**
   2A + D + 20 = 45
   2A + D = 25

4. **We need to find D (Dinar's score).  We can use the fact that B = D + 10:**
   2A + (D + 10) = 25
   2A + D = 15

5. **Now we have two equations with two unknowns (A and D). We can solve for A:**
   *  2A + D = 15
   *  2A + D = 25

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 1356
   6S = 1019
   S = 169.83

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's go back and see if our assumptions are correct.**

* **Alex:**  A = S + 5 = 169.83 + 5 = 174.83 (This is not a whole number, so we need to adjust our approach)
* **Adelwolfe:** W = (347 - 2S) / 4 = (347 - 2 * 169.83) / 4 = 49.83 (Again, not a whole number)

**It seems like there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible to have a whole number of Pokemon caught with these conditions.**

* The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those destinations gets 1/4 of the flights.

**2. Flights to Poland:**

* The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of trips the first plane makes.

**3.  Calculate the total number of flights for the first plane:**

* Let 'x' be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
* We know 3/4 of the flights are to Greece, so 3/4 * x = number of flights to Greece.
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so (1/4) * x = number of flights to France + number of flights to Germany.
* The other plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so 44 = (1/2) * x.

**4. Solve for x:**

* We can now solve for x by using the information from step 3.
* 44 = (1/2) * x
* 88 = x

**5. Calculate the number of flights to France:**

* The first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know that 95% of x is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.95x = 0.28 
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.95 = 0.294 (approximately)

**2. Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 91% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
*  We know that 91% of the initial charge is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.91x = 0.28
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.91 = 0.306 (approximately)

**3. Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
*  We know that 93% of the initial charge is equal to 28% after 3 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.93x = 0.28
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.93 = 0.306 (approximately)


**4. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 91% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
*  We know that 91% of the initial charge is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.91x = 0.28

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (5/3)C - C = 5
   * (2/3)C = 5

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
* Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* ""Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes"":  b = 3c - 2
* ""Each person gets two treats"":  5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats

**3. Solve for the number of cupcakes (c):**

* We know the total number of treats is 10. 
* Since each person gets 2 treats, we can set up an equation: c + b = 10
* Substitute the first equation (b = 3c - 2) into the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10
* Simplify and solve for 'c': 4c - 2 = 10
                                          4c = 12

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    *  Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    *  He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    *  The total number of items is 29: t + p + b = 29  (where 'b' is the number of beakers)

* **Solve for the number of beakers (b):**
    *  We know t = 8 and p = 16, so substitute these values into the equation: 8 + 16 + b = 29
    *  Combine like terms: 24 + b = 29
    *  Subtract 24 from both sides: b = 5

* **Calculate the number of beakers Igor lost:**
    *  Igor had 5 beakers on the bench, and he lost some. 
    *  Since he had 29 total items, and 5 beakers, he lost 5 - 29 = -24 beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Find James's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** John was 19 when James was born, so he is currently 32 + 19 = 51 years old.
* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 - 3 = 29 years old. In 3 years, he will be 29 + 3 = **32 years old**.


**Answer:** 32

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**Set up the equations:**

* **Equation 1 (Total animals):** c + w = 20 
* **Equation 2 (Total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':**  w = 20 - c
2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.
