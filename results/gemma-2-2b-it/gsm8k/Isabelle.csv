"Let's break down this problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

* **Finding the Unit:**  We know Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

* **Setting up the Equation:**  Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water.  We can set up an equation:

   (7/13) * x = 120 teaspoons

* **Solving for x:**
   * Multiply both sides by 13: 7x = 1560 teaspoons
   * Divide both sides by 7: x = 224 cups

* **Finding the Sugar:**  We know the ratio is 7:13, so we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
   * (7/13) * 224 cups = 120 teaspoons

**Answer:** 120 teaspoons

"Let's break down the price increase:

* **Month 1:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is (20/100) * $20 = $4.
* **Month 2:** The price is now $20 + $4 = $24.
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is (20/100) * $24 = $4.80.
* **Month 4:** The price is now $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is (20/100) * $28.80 = $5.76.
* **Month 6:** The price is now $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

You can continue this pattern for the remaining months. 

**However, there's a more efficient way to solve this:**

Notice that the price increases by a fixed amount each time.  We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the final price:

* **Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + (Increase Rate / 100))^Number of Months**

Let's plug in the values:

* Initial Price = $20
* Increase Rate = 20% = 0.20
* Number of Months = 36

Final Price = $20 * (1 + (0.20 / 100))^36 
Final Price = $20 * (1.02)^36

You can use a calculator to find the final price.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by ""B""**
* **Let Seth's current age be represented by ""S""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Since Brooke's age must be a whole number, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume Brooke is 8 years old.

Now we can find Seth's age:

* **S = 2B** 
* **S = 2 * 8**
* **S = 16**

**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool has 8x gallons and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = 4(x - 16)
    * 8x = 4x - 64

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it's traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

**2. Use the formula: distance = speed x time**

* We know the distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the slow lane (30 miles/hour).  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.
*  480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

**3. Solve for 't':**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Distance from third to first:** The train travels 50 miles less than the combined distance from the second to the third city, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Total distance for one trip:** The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.
* **Total distance for three trips:** The total distance for three trips is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.
* **Days for service:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it needs service after 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.3833 services.

* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
* Let 'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
* Let 'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.

**Set up equations based on the information given:**

* We know that r = b - 0.01b  (1% fewer red than blue)
* We also know that g = r + 0.01g (1% more green than blue)
* And finally, we know that r + b + g = 4500 (total jelly beans)

**Solve for the number of jelly beans:**

1. **Simplify the equations:**
   * r = 0.99b 
   * g = 0.01g + r = 0.01g + 0.99b

2. **Substitute the value of 'r' from the first equation into the second equation:**
   * g = 0.01g + 0.99b

3. **Solve for 'g' in terms of 'b':**
   * 0.99g = 0.01g + 0.99b
   * 0.98g = 0.99b
   * g = 0.99b / 0.98

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation for 'r':**
   * r = 0.99b

5. **Substitute the value of 'r' and 'g' into the total jelly bean equation:**
   * 0.99b + b + (0.99b / 0.98) = 4500

6. **Solve for 'b':**
   * 1.98b + (0.99b / 0.98) = 4500
   * 1.98b + 1.00b = 4500 * 0.98
   * 2.98b = 4410
   * b = 4410 / 2.98
   * b = 1480

7. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans (r):**
   * r = 0.99b = 0.99 * 1480 = 1462.2

8. **Calculate the difference between green and red jelly beans:**
   * g - r = (0.99b / 0.98) - 0.99b = (0.99 * 1480 / 0.98) - 0.99 * 1480 = 1462.2 - 1462.2 = 0

**Answer:** There are **0** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the amount of water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we want to know the amount used for non-industrial purposes, we need to find the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes.

* **Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.**
   80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes.

* **Step 3: Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can use the following formula:

   (Non-industrial water use / Total water use) * 100%

   We know that 40% of the water is used by the city, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.  

   Therefore, the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is:

   (100% - 80%) * 40% = 20%

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.** 
* **Since Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses x ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * salt ounces of oil.**
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2 * x ounces of salt.**

**Now, let's use the information about the total amount of each ingredient:**

* **Salt:**  x ounces (zest) = 2 * x ounces (salt)
* **Oil:** 2 * x ounces (salt) = 2 * (x ounces) = 2x ounces (oil)
* **Total:** 10 ounces (total) = x ounces (zest) + x ounces (fragrance) + 2x ounces (salt) + 2x ounces (oil)

**We can simplify the equation:**

* 10 ounces = x + x + 2x + 2x
* 10 ounces = 6x

**Solve for x:**

* x = 10 ounces / 6
* x = 1.67 ounces (approximately)

**Now, we can find the amount of oil:**

* Oil = 2x ounces = 2 * 1.67 ounces = 3.34 ounces (approximately)

**Therefore, Tanya uses approximately 3.34 ounces of oil.**

"Hi there!  

To figure out the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the total amount of glue left and then subtract the amount used. 

Here's how:

* **Calculate the total glue left:** 
   * (1/6) + (2/3) + (1/2) = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 
   * Convert 8/6 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: 8/6 = 4/3
   * Since we're looking for the length of glue not used, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are not used. 

* **Calculate the total length of glue sticks that are not used:**
   * 12 millimeters (original length) - (4/3) * 12 millimeters = 12 - 16 millimeters = -4 millimeters

**Final answer:** -4 millimeters

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let your age be represented by ""x""
* Your brother's age is ""x + 3"" (3 years younger than you)
* Your sister's age is ""x - 2"" (2 years older than you)
* Your mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1"" (one less than three times your brother's age)

**Set up an equation:**

The sum of your ages is 87: 
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: 
   5x + 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
2. Simplify:
   8x + 10 = 87
3. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   8x = 77
4. Divide both sides by 8:
   x = 9.625

**Find your age:**

Since you can't have a fraction of a year, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem.  Let's assume the problem meant to say your mom's age is ""three times your brother's age minus 1"". 

**Let's re-evaluate:**

* Your age is ""x""
* Your brother's age is ""x + 3""
* Your sister's age is ""x - 2""
* Your mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1""

**Set up the equation:**

The sum of your ages is 87:
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms:

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Joe's lawn mowing:**  We don't know how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, but we know she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times. 
* **Kamala's lawn mowing:**  Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.  Kamala's lawn would be 3x times.
* **Alba's lawn mowing:**  Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
* **Total earnings:** Tasha made $6 from Joe's lawn mowing. 

**Let's calculate the earnings from each lawn:**

* **Joe's lawn:**  Joe paid Tasha $6.
* **Kamala's lawn:**  Tasha earned 3x times the amount she earned from Joe's lawn.
* **Alba's lawn:** Tasha earned 5x times the amount she earned from Joe's lawn.

**Total earnings from all lawns:**

* **Total earnings:** $6 + (3x * amount per lawn) + (5x * amount per lawn)

**We know that the total earnings from all lawns is $80.**

**Let's solve for x:**

* **Total earnings:** $6 + 3x * amount per lawn + 5x * amount per lawn = $80
* **Total earnings:** $6 + 8x * amount per lawn = $80
* **Total earnings:** 8x * amount per lawn = $74

**We can use the information about Joe's lawn to find x:**

* **Joe's lawn:** Tasha earned $6 from Joe's lawn. 
* **Joe's lawn:** $6 = x * amount per lawn

**We can now substitute this value of x into the equation for the total earnings:**

* **Total earnings:** $6 + 8x * amount per lawn = $80

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let John's age be represented by 'x'.**
* **Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is 'x + 10'.**
* **Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is 'x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10'.**
* **The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we have the equation: 2x + 10 + x + 10 = 100**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 3x + 20 = 100**
* **Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x = 80**
* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 26.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's assume the combined age is 100 years old. 

* **Peter's age is 2x + 10 = 2(26.67) + 10 = 53.34 + 10 = 63.34**

**Therefore, Peter's age is approximately 63.34 years old.**

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    * A + D + B = 45 (The total points for the team)

* **Solve for A (Azibo's score):**
    * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to find A:
        * D + 10 = A + 20
        * A = D - 10 
    * Now, substitute this value of A back into the equation A + D + B = 45:

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the others got.**
* **Amora and Lainey got 70 chips each, so they got a total of 70 + 70 = 140 chips.**
* **The other person got 15 more than the others, so they got x + 15 chips.**
* **Since only two people get an equal amount, the total number of chips must be divisible by 2.**

**Therefore, we can set up an equation:**

x + (x + 15) = 140

**Solving for x:**

2x + 15 = 140
2x = 125
x = 62.5

**Since we can't have half a corn chip, there must be an error in the problem setup.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (They have caught a total of 339 Pokemon)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339

5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation:
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

6. **Substitute** this value of W back into the equation 2S + W + 5 = 339:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) + 5 = 339

7. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   8S + 347 - 2S + 20 = 1356
   6S = 1009
   S = 168.17

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's go back and see if our calculations are consistent with the given information.**

* Alex caught A = S + 5 = 168.17 + 5 = 173.17 Pokemon. This doesn't make sense. 
* Adelwolfe caught W = (347 - 2S) / 4 = (347 - 2 * 168.17) / 4 = 40.86 Pokemon. This also doesn't make sense.

**It seems there's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to have a whole number of Pokemon caught with these conditions.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know that 95% of x is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
*  Therefore, 0.95x = 0.28 
* Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.95 = 0.294 (approximately)

**2. Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* The initial charge was 0.294.

**3. Calculate the charge after 8 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 93% of its capacity remaining after 3 hours.
* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 93% of its capacity remaining after 3 hours.
* Let 'y' be the charge after 8 hours.
* We know that 93% of y is equal to 28% after 8 hours.
* Therefore, 0.93y = 0.28
* Solving for y: y = 0.28 / 0.93 = 0.30 (approximately)

**4. Calculate the initial charge:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
* The initial charge was 0.294.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have half a ball, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **T-Rex eats half:** The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, leaving 1/2 * original amount.
* **Velociraptors eat half:** The velociraptors ate half of what was left, meaning they ate 1/2 * (1/2 * original amount).
* **Allosaurus eats the rest:** The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining amount after the T-Rex and velociraptors.

**Let's represent the original amount of meat as ""x"".**

* **T-Rex's portion:** x / 2
* **Velociraptors' portion:** (x / 2) / 2 = x / 4
* **Allosaurus' portion:** 270 kg

**We know that the sum of the portions eaten by the T-Rex and velociraptors equals the original amount:**

x / 2 + x / 4 = 270 kg

**Now we can solve for x:**

* Find a common denominator: (2/4)x + (1/4)x = 270 kg
* Combine terms: (3/4)x = 270 kg
* Multiply both sides by 4/3: x = 360 kg

**Therefore, there were 360 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
    * Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
    * Let 'K' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
    * C = 2 * J (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
    * J + C + K = Total seashells (They divided the total equally)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Since J = C + 5, we can substitute C in the equation C = 2 * J:
        * J = (C + 5) + 5
        * J = C + 10
    * Now we can substitute J in the equation J + C + K = Total seashells:
        * (C + 10) + C + K = Total seashells
        * 2C + K = Total seashells

* **We need to find the total number of seashells:**
    * We know Jim collected 27 seashells. 
    * We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so we need to find the number of seashells Carrey collected. 

* **We can use the information about Jim's seashells to find the total number of seashells:**
    * Jim collected 27 seashells. 
    * We know that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos. 
    * Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. 

* **Now we can find the total number of seashells:**
    * Total seashells = 27 + 22 + K = 49 + K

* **We can now solve for K (the number of seashells Carlos collected):**
    * 2C + K = Total seashells
    * 2 * 22 + K = 49 + K
    * 44 + K = 49 + K
    * K = 49

* **Finally, we can find how many seashells each person got:**
    * Each person got 49 / 3 = 16.33 seashells. 

**Therefore, each person got approximately 16.33 seashells.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the daily energy demand per person:**

* Each juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy need.
* So, 1 juice provides 0.20 * 1 person's energy need.

**2. Calculate the total daily energy need of 2300 people:**

* Total energy need = 2300 people * 1 person's energy need per day 

**3. Calculate the total energy need in juice units:**

* Total energy need in juice units = Total energy need / Juice coverage per person
* Total energy need in juice units = (2300 people * 1 person's energy need per day) / 0.20

**4. Calculate the number of bottles needed:**

* Bottles needed = Total energy need in juice units / Daily production
* Bottles needed = ((2300 people * 1 person's energy need per day) / 0.20) / 4200 bottles

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **Blue rope length:** The blue rope was 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's x - 7 centimeters long.

* **Red rope length:** The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

* **Combined length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 6x - 28 = 37
    * Add 28 to both sides: 6x = 65
    * Divide both sides by 6: x = 10.83 (approximately)

* **Find the length of the red rope:**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), we can substitute that into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
    * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: S = K + 12
    * We know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: S = K + 8

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
    * Since we know S = K + 12 and S = K + 8, we can set the two equations equal to each other: K + 12 = K + 8
    * This means the value of K (Kim's paintings) is the same in both equations. 

* **Find Kim's paintings:**
    * We know Samantha has 27 paintings, and we know S = K + 12.  
    * Substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation: K + 12 = 27
    * Subtract 12 from both sides: K = 15

**Therefore, Kim has 15 paintings.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**We know:**

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20 
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
