"Let's solve this problem:

* **Let Seth's current age be ""S""**
* **Let Brooke's current age be ""B""**

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know that r + w = total chickens 
* We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

**3. Formulate equations from the given information:**

* 3r + 5w = 42  (eggs from red and white chickens)
* r = w + 2   (two more white chickens than red)

**4. Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

* Substitute the second equation (r = w + 2) into the first equation: 
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
* Simplify and solve for 'w':

   * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it's traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

**2. Use the formula: distance = speed x time**

* We know the distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the slow lane (30 miles/hour).  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.
*  480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

**3. Solve for 't':**

* t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**

* **We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago, so: x = 2(x - 5)**

* **Now we can solve for x:**
    * x = 2x - 10
    * x - 2x = -10
    * -x = -10
    * x = 10

* **Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Friday's chimichangas:** They make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as on Wednesday, so they make 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas on Friday.
* **Total chimichangas:**  To find the total, add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.

**Answer:** 500

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the total number of microphones that won't fit:** 50 microphones * 20% = 10 microphones
* **Calculate the number of microphones that fit:** 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones
* **Calculate the number of pairs:** 40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs

**Answer:** 20

* **First plane's flights:** Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights in a day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1 - 3/4)x = (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany.
* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

* 40% represents 40 out of every 100 students in the school.

**2. Find the Total Population:**

* Since 240 boys represent 40% of the school population, we can set up a proportion: 
   * 40/100 = 240/x  (where x is the total number of students)
* Cross-multiply: 40 * x = 240 * 100
* Simplify: 40x = 24000
* Solve for x: x = 24000 / 40 = 600 students

**3. Find the Number of Girls:**

* The total population is 600 students, and we know 40% are boys.
* The number of girls is: 600 - 240 = 360 girls

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  Total eggs painted: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for y (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

**4. Solve for x (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

*  We know that x + x = 2x
*  We also know that y = 22 - x
*  Substitute the value of y into the equation: 22 - x + x = 2x
*  Simplify: 22 = 2x
*  Solve for x: x = 11

**5. Solve for Camden's eggs:**

*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Camden painted 22 - 11 + 12 = 23 eggs

**6. Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**

*  Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

**Find the length of the red rope:**

* Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (5/3)C - C = 5
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

3. **The answer:**
   Colin is currently 25/2 years old, which simplifies to 12.5 years old.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: People after the first stop**
   - The bus had 20 people and 40 people entered, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

* **Step 2: People at the second stop**
   - 3/4 of the people from the first stop entered the bus, so 40 * (3/4) = 30 people entered at the second stop.
   - The total number of people at the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90 people.

* **Step 3: People after the second stop**
   - The bus had 90 people and doubled at the third stop, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

* **Step 4: People remaining**
   - The bus has a capacity of 200 people and currently has 180 people, so there are 200 - 180 = 20 people remaining.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know:

* **Each person gets 2 treats.**
* **The class has 5 people.**

Therefore, the total number of treats is: 5 * 2 = 10

**To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:**

* **b + c = 10**  (The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies)

**Now, substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:**

* **(3c - 2) + c = 10**

**Simplify and solve for 'c':**

* **4c - 2 = 10**
* **4c = 12**
* **c = 3**

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**
