**Understanding the Problem**

* We know the current ages of Mico and Marco.
* We need to find their ages in 10 years.
* The sum of their ages is a constant value.

**Solution**

1. **Let's represent their current ages:**
   * Let Mico's age be represented by 'm'
   * Let Marco's age be represented by 'm'

2. **Set up the equation:**
   * m + m = 20 (The sum of their ages is 20)

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Sam's current age be represented by the variable ""S""
* Let Ruby's current age be represented by the variable ""R""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam""  => R = 6S
*  ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"" => R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Now we can solve for Sam's age (S):**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the change Billy received:**

* Billy paid $10.00 and the candy cost $1.50 per pound, so he had $10.00 - $1.50 = $8.50 in change.

**2. Calculate how much money Billy spent on gumballs:**

* He spent half his change, which is $8.50 / 2 = $4.25 on gumballs.

**3. Calculate how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**

* He spent $4.25 on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05, so he bought $4.25 / $0.05 = 85 gumballs.
* Since he bought 40 gumballs, he must have bought 40 gumballs / 85 gumballs per pound = 0.47 pounds of candy.

"Let's break down this word problem:

* **Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""x"".**

* **Twice Carver's son's age is 2x.**

* **Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so his age is 2x - 5.**

* **We know Carver is 45 years old, so we can set up an equation:** 2x - 5 = 45

**Now, solve for x:**

1. **Add 5 to both sides:** 2x = 50
2. **Divide both sides by 2:** x = 25

**Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**

* The second city to the third city is 100 miles.
* The third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

**2. Calculate the total distance of the round trip:**

* The total distance for one round trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

**3. Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:**

* The train travels 225 miles per round trip, and it does this 3 times a day, so it travels 225 * 3 = 675 miles per day.

**4. Calculate the number of days between services:**

* The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
* Divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

**5. Round to the nearest whole number:**

* Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, the answer is **27 days**.

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Guaranteed not to explode:**  This means 99% of the candles are safe.
* **5% have a defect:** This means 5% of the candles are dangerous and smell like wet dog.

**Key Insight**

The problem is asking for the intersection of two events: smelling like wet dog AND exploding.  We need to find the number of candles that are both defective AND explode.

**Solution**

1. **Calculate the number of defective candles:** 5% of 50,000 candles = (5/100) * 50,000 = 2500 candles.

2. **Calculate the number of candles that are both defective and explode:**  We don't know the exact number of candles that explode. We only know that 5% of the defective candles explode. 

**Important Note:** The problem doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact number of candles that explode. 


**Final Answer:**  We cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Apples from the shortest trees:**

* Joanne gathers half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 30 apples / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.

**2. Apples from the tallest trees:**

* Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 apples * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

**3. Total apples gathered by Joanne:**

* Joanne gathers apples from the tallest, shortest, and average trees. 
* Let 'x' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
* We know she gathers 30 from the tallest trees + 15 from the shortest trees + x from the average trees = 45 + x apples.

**4. Total apples gathered by the sisters:**

* The total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 30 + 15 + x + 60 = 105 + x

**5. Setting up the equation:**

* We know the sisters have a combined total of 500 apples. So, 105 + x = 500

**6. Solving for x:**

* Subtract 105 from both sides: x = 395

**Answer:** Joanne gathered 395 apples from the average trees.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *c* represent the number of camels
*  *d* represent the number of dromedaries

**Set up the equations:**

*  We know that the total number of heads is 180:  *c + d = 180*
*  We know that the total number of bumps is 304:  2c + d = 304 

**Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**

* Solve the first equation for *c*:  *c = 180 - d*

**Substitute into the second equation:**

* Substitute *(180 - d)* for *c* in the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

**Simplify and solve for *d*:**

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

**Answer:** There are **56** dromedaries.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Set up the equations:**

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Set the equations equal to each other:**

Since the cost is equal for both venues, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

**Answer:** 8 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects. 


**Note:**  Since we can't have a fraction of an insect, we can assume there's a slight error in the problem setup.

    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)
*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Now we can solve for S (Stan's catch):**

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation:  (S + 5) + S + W = 339
2. **Simplify** the equation: 2S + W = 334
3. **Substitute** the third equation into the simplified equation: 2S + (4W - 13) = 334
4. **Simplify** the equation: 2S + 4W = 347
5. **Solve for W** in terms of S in the third equation: W = (347 - 2S) / 4
6. **Substitute** this value of W into the equation 2S + W = 347: 2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) = 347
7. **Simplify** and solve for S: 8S + 347 - 2S = 1388
                                          6S = 1041

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
* Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

**2. Set up the Equation:**

* The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so the earnings from large stuffed animals are 3 * (4 * small stuffed animals) = 12 * small stuffed animals.
* The earnings from small stuffed animals are 4 * small stuffed animals.
* The total earnings are the sum of earnings from large and small stuffed animals: 12 * small stuffed animals + 4 * small stuffed animals = $120

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine the earnings from small stuffed animals: 16 * small stuffed animals = $120
* Divide both sides by 16 to find the number of small stuffed animals: 16 * small stuffed animals / 16 = $120 / 16
* Therefore, she sold 7.5 small stuffed animals.

**Understanding Proportional Pricing**

The key is that the prices are proportional. This means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is the same for all packages. 

* **Package 1:** 2 sandwiches / $3
* **Package 2:** 4 sandwiches / $6

**Finding the Price Ratio**

Let's find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for each package:

* **Package 1:** $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
* **Package 2:** $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

**Calculating the Price of Package 3**

Since the prices are proportional, the price of package 3 will also be $1.50 per sandwich.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  Total eggs painted: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for y (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

**4. Substitute the value of y into the equation for Camden and Sarah's eggs:**

* Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
* Camden painted (22 - x) + 12 = 34 - x

**5.  Solve for x (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

*  We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.
*  2x + (2y + 12) = 56
*  2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
*  2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
*  56 = 56 

**6.  Solve for x:**

*  Since 56 = 56, we can see that the equation is true. This means we have a system of equations that is dependent. 

**7.  Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**

*  Camden painted 34 - x eggs.
*  Arnold painted x eggs.
*  The difference is 34 - x - x = 34 - 2x

**8.  Since we have a dependent system of equations, we can't determine a specific numerical answer for the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs.** 



**Final Answer:**  We cannot determine a numerical answer for the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs.

* Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, and at twice the speed of the beach.
* Let 'x' be the speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
* Speed on the sidewalk is then 2x.

**2. Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**

* Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (2x) minutes

**3. Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

* Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
* Total time = 40 minutes + (1 mile / (2x)) minutes

**4.  Set up an equation:**

* Total distance = 3 miles
* Distance on beach + Distance on sidewalk = 3 miles
* 2 miles + 1 mile = 3 miles

**5.  Solve for x:**

* We know the total distance is 3 miles.
* 2 miles + 1 mile = 3 miles
* 3 miles = 3 miles

**6.  Substitute the value of x into the total time equation:**

* Total time = 40 minutes + (1 mile / (2 * x)) minutes

**7.  Simplify the equation:**

* Total time = 40 minutes + (1 mile / (2 * x)) minutes

**8.  Solve for the total time:**

* You can't solve for the total time without knowing the value of 'x' (the speed on the beach). 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact time it takes Grandma to complete the entire walk without knowing the speed on the beach.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""**
   This translates to: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C + 5 = (5/3)C
   (8/3)C = 5
   C = 15/8

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know the following:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)
* **b + c = 5 * 2** (Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people)

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of cupcakes):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   (3c - 2) + c = 10

2. **Combine like terms:**
   4c - 2 = 10

3. **Add 2 to both sides:**
   4c = 12

4. **Divide both sides by 4:**
   c = 3

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

**Let:**

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

**Set up the equations:**

* **Equation 1 (Total animals):** c + w = 20 
* **Equation 2 (Total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':**  w = 20 - c
2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5
