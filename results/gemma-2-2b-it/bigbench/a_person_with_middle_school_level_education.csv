"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **St. Vitus's Dance** is a neurological condition that causes involuntary, uncontrollable movements. It's a serious medical condition.
* Ballet requires incredible precision, control, and grace.  Someone with St. Vitus's Dance would have difficulty performing the complex movements and poses needed for ballet. 

It's important to remember that people with disabilities can be talented in many areas, but St. Vitus's Dance would make it very difficult to excel in a highly demanding activity like ballet. 
"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Pig Latin is a language game, not a real language.**  It's a fun way to change the order of words in a sentence. 
* **Pigs don't actually speak English or any other language.**  They communicate with each other using sounds and body language. 

So, it's not impossible for pigs to use Pig Latin, it's just not something they would do! 
"
"(B) No 

Here's why:

* **Ringo Starr is a famous musician.**  He's known for being a drummer and a member of The Beatles. 
* **People often associate musicians with a healthy lifestyle.**  It's unlikely a famous musician would avoid a pot roast just because it's a common dish. 

It's important to remember that this is just a guess based on general knowledge. 
"
"(B) Yes 

Here's why:

* **The Summer Olympics** are a big deal, but they usually have a lot of people watching. 
* **The Super Bowl** is the biggest game in American football, and it's a huge event with a huge crowd. 
* **1936** was a long time ago, and stadiums have gotten much bigger since then. 

So, a Super Bowl crowd would be way too big for a stadium built for the Olympics. 
"
"The answer is **(B) Yes**.

Here's why:

* **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)** is a serious mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. 
* **Ariana Grande** is a famous singer and actress. While she may have experienced personal challenges, it's not appropriate to discuss her mental health as a direct example of PTSD.

* **Iris** is a messenger goddess, so she's probably really good at communication and getting things done quickly. But she's also a bit of a trickster, so maybe she'd be a little too playful and forgetful at a job like UPS. 
* **Hermes** is the messenger god of the gods, so he's fast and good at delivering things. But he's also known for being a bit of a prankster and maybe not the most organized. 

So, they might be good at the job, but they might also be a little too... *them* for a regular UPS job. 😜

Here's why:

* **Lactic acid is a natural part of how our bodies work.**  When you exercise, your muscles use energy.  Lactic acid is a byproduct of that energy production. 
* **It's not always bad.**  Your body makes lactic acid to help you power through short bursts of intense activity.  
* **It's a signal that you're working hard.**  The more lactic acid builds up, the more tired you feel.  But it's a sign that your muscles are working hard and getting stronger.

**Think of it like this:**  Your body is like a car.  When you drive fast, your engine gets hot and makes a little bit of smoke.  That smoke is like lactic acid.  It's not good to have too much smoke, but it's normal when you're pushing your car hard.

* **1948 War:**  The war that followed the partition plan led to the creation of the State of Israel and the displacement of many Palestinians. 
* **Ongoing Influence:** England's historical involvement, including its role in the creation of Israel and its continued influence in the region, has been a major factor in the ongoing conflict.

* **Oscar Wilde was convicted of ""gross indecency""**, which was a law that criminalized homosexual acts.  This law was based on the idea that homosexuality was a crime and a threat to society.
* **Today, homosexuality is legal and accepted in most countries.**  The idea that being gay is a crime is no longer considered acceptable in most places.

* **Ahimsa** is a Sanskrit word that means ""non-violence"" or ""non-harming."" It's a core principle in Hinduism and some other religions.
* **Paul the Apostle** was a follower of Jesus, a central figure in Christianity. Christianity teaches that Jesus was the Son of God and that his death was a sacrifice for the sins of humanity.

Think of it like this:

* You're running and you jump. You have kinetic energy.
* You land on the ground. You still have some kinetic energy, even if you're not moving as fast.
* Ukumi helps you absorb that energy and reduce the force of the impact, but it doesn't make the energy disappear.

**Important to remember:**  It's important to be careful about making absolute statements about history.  There are many factors to consider when talking about the deadliest revolutions, like:

* **Time period:**  Revolutions happen over time, so comparing them across centuries is tricky.
* **Definition of ""deadliest"":**  Do we mean the most deaths in a single event, or the total number of deaths over a period of time?
* **Accuracy of records:**  Historical records can be incomplete or biased.

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they each traded one book.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means they each traded one book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they each traded one book.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each traded one book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they each traded one book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means they each traded one book.

**The Key:**

The question asks for Alice's book at the end of the semester.  We need to figure out which book she ends up with after all the trades. 

**Let's analyze the trades:**

* **Alice starts with Ulysses.**
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Ulysses.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Eve gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Ulysses.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Ulysses.

* Alice: Blue
* Bob: Green
* Claire: Yellow
* Dave: Black
* Eve: Red
* Fred: Orange
* Gertrude: Purple

**2.  Analyze the trades:**

* **Claire and Bob:**  Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so they each get a new ball.

**3.  The key is to see who ends up with the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them.**

* **Fred:**  Fred ends up with the ball that was originally held by Eve. 


**Therefore, the answer is (B) red ball.**

"Here's how to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end:

* **Start with the initial pairings:**  We know who everyone is dancing with at the beginning.
* **Track the swaps:**  We need to see how the pairings change throughout the dance.
* **Analyze the changes:**  Each swap affects the pairings.

Let's break it down:

1. **Bob and Fred switch:**  This changes Bob to dance with Melissa and Fred to dance with Izzi.
2. **Claire and Alice switch:** This changes Alice to dance with Dave and Claire to dance with Rodrigo.
3. **Claire and Dave switch:** This changes Dave to dance with Melissa and Claire to dance with Sam.
4. **Gertrude and Alice switch:** This changes Alice to dance with Rodrigo and Gertrude to dance with Sam.
5. **Claire and Bob switch:** This changes Bob to dance with Melissa and Claire to dance with Izzi.
6. **Dave and Fred switch:** This changes Fred to dance with Melissa and Dave to dance with Rodrigo.
7. **Eve and Alice switch:** This changes Alice to dance with Rodrigo and Eve to dance with Izzi.

**Therefore, Claire is dancing with Izzi at the end of the dance.**

"Here's how we can figure out the answer:

**1.  Start with the initial gifts:**

* Alice: White
* Bob: Orange
* Claire: Black
* Dave: Pink
* Eve: Purple
* Fred: Green
* Gertrude: Brown

**2.  Swap 1: Fred and Eve**

* Fred's gift goes to Eve, and Eve's gift goes to Fred.  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a new order.

**3. Swap 2: Bob and Dave**

* Bob's gift goes to Dave, and Dave's gift goes to Bob.

**4. Swap 3: Dave and Alice**

* Dave's gift goes to Alice, and Alice's gift goes to Dave.

**5. Swap 4: Bob and Claire**

* Bob's gift goes to Claire, and Claire's gift goes to Bob.

**6. Swap 5: Fred and Eve**

* Fred's gift goes to Eve, and Eve's gift goes to Fred.

**7. Swap 6: Dave and Claire**

* Dave's gift goes to Claire, and Claire's gift goes to Dave.

**8. Swap 7: Fred and Gertrude**

* Fred's gift goes to Gertrude, and Gertrude's gift goes to Fred.

**Conclusion:**

We can't determine the final gift Alice has.  We only know that the gifts have been swapped.

"Here's how we can figure out the answer:

**Understanding the Swaps**

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  They swap, so we don't know who gets what.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so we don't know who gets what.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so we don't know who gets what.
