"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with what we know:**

* **Flutist lives in house 2.** 

**2. Use the clues to connect information:**

* **Clue 2:** Tulips are to the left of the guitarist.
* **Clue 3:** Lilies are to the left of carnations.

**3.  Consider the spacing:**

* **Clue 4:** One house between the flutist and the pianist.

**4.  Put it all together:**

Since we know the flutist is in house 2, and there's one house between the flutist and the pianist, the pianist must be in house 3 or 4.  

Let's try a few arrangements based on the other clues:

* **If the pianist is in house 3:**  This would mean the guitarist is in house 4, and the tulips would have to be in house 1. This fits with clue 2.

* **If the pianist is in house 4:** This doesn't work because it wouldn't leave space for the tulips to be to the left of the guitarist.

* **Clue 4 tells us:** The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

* **Clue 1 tells us:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.

* **Clue 2 tells us:** The person wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

**1.  Start with the clues:**

* **Clue 1:** Sandals are to the left of horses.
* **Clue 2:** History book buff is to the right of spaghetti.

**2.  Think about the possibilities:**

* We know the houses are numbered 1 and 2.  Let's use those to keep track.

**3.  Combine the clues:**

*  Since we don't know for sure who lives in which house yet, let's make a table to help us organize the information:

| 1     |        |          |            |         |
| 2     |        |          |            |         |

We know the flutist isn't in house 1, so let's put that in our table:

| 2     |        |          |  Flute     |         |

Now, Clue 1 tells us the sedan is to the left of the lilies.  Since the sedan can't be in house 1 (because the flutist is there), it must be in house 2.

| House | Person | Flowers | Instrument | Car    |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1     |        |          |  Saxophone |         |

| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**2. Start Filling in the Grid**

We'll use the clues to fill in the grid.  Here are some we can start with:

* **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.  Let's represent them with ""S"" and ""W"" for now.

* **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots lives directly left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 6:** The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. 

   These clues tell us the order of boots, stew, and high heels must be from left to right.

* **Use the clues to narrow it down:**

   * Clue 1 tells us grilled cheese is to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper can't be in house 2.

* **Deduce the rest:**

   * Since the percussionist isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1.
   *  The only instrument left is guitar, so the person in house 2 is the guitarist.

Let's put it all together:

* House 1: Mystery book reader 
* House 2:  Could be romance, bird, or horse
* House 3:  Could be romance, bird, or horse

Since we know the bird keeper is left of the history buff, and they can't be in the third house, the only option is:

* **Who is William Franklyn-Miller?** Is he a professional race car driver?
* **What kind of car would he be driving?**  NASCAR has different types of cars.
* **How good is he at racing?**  Does he have experience and wins in other races?


I'm just a regular person, not a racing expert!

"(B) No 

Here's why:

* **Jacques Duèze** was a really old guy, a Pope in the 1300s! 
* **Richard Dawkins** is a scientist who lived much, much later, in the 1900s and 2000s.

They lived in totally different times and wouldn't have known each other. 
"
"(B) No 

Here's why:

* **Macaques are pretty big!** They're not like little hamsters you could sneak in a pocket. 
* **They're wild animals.** They need lots of space to move around and special food. Keeping one under a desk would be really bad for the monkey.
* **It's probably against the rules.** Schools usually don't allow wild animals. 


It's important to treat animals with respect and keep them in safe and healthy environments.

"I don't know enough about Goofy's creator or his employer to answer that question.  

Excommunicable offenses are serious religious matters, and I'm not familiar with the specifics of any religious group that Goofy's creator might have belonged to. 

To answer your question, I'd need more information about:

* **Who created Goofy**
* **Who their employer was**
* **What religion, if any, they practiced**
* **What the specific offense was** 


Let me know if you can give me more details! 

"
"That's a tricky question.  

I think the answer is **(A) Yes**.  

Some mental health stuff can be hard to see from the outside.  Like, someone might seem fine, but they could be feeling really sad or anxious inside.  It's like having a secret you don't want to share. 

But it's important to remember that everyone struggles sometimes, and it's okay to ask for help if you need it.  Talking to a trusted adult can make a big difference.
"
"(A) Yes 

Here's why:

Paul Bunyan is a giant who chops down trees and builds things with his super strength.  Urban planning is about making cities work for people, with things like roads, parks, and buildings.  Paul Bunyan's size and strength wouldn't really help with that! He might accidentally knock down buildings or make roads too big for cars.

Here's why:

* Goblin sharks have really long snouts and no arms or legs.  
* Bikes need hands to hold the handlebars and feet to pedal. 
* Even if a goblin shark *had* arms and legs, its body shape is probably too weird to balance on a bike! 



"
"The answer is **(B) Yes**. 

Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana, and they were a big part of the grunge music scene.  Even though he died, lots of bands kept playing that kind of music.

"(B) No 

You can totally use a spice grinder for cinnamon sticks! It'll make them into a fine powder, which is good for baking.  
"
"I'd say **(A) Yes**.

"
"It depends on the kind of soup! 

Some soups are thick and chunky, like chili or stew, and you could probably eat those with a spoon or even your hands. But most soups are thin and runny, so you'd definitely need a spoon.

"The answer is **(B) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Dafne Keen is an actress**, she's known for her roles in movies, not singing. 
* **Eurovision is a singing competition**.  You have to be a singer to compete! 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"(A) Yes 

Here's why:

* **Iris is a messenger goddess.**  She's super fast, but she's more about delivering important messages from the gods, not packages. 
* **Hermes is the messenger god too!** He's known for being quick and clever, but he's also a trickster.  He might get distracted or make mistakes with the deliveries.

UPS needs people who are reliable and follow rules, and those gods might not be the best fit!

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Pi (π)** is approximately 3.14.
* **Square root of 5** is a little more than 2 (because 2 x 2 = 4 and 3 x 3 = 9).

"It's not necessarily bad to have lactic acid in your body. 

Here's why:

* **It's normal:** Your body makes lactic acid when you exercise, especially when you're doing something really intense. 
* **It helps:** Lactic acid actually helps your muscles work harder for a short time.

* **It goes away:** Your body gets rid of lactic acid after you stop exercising.

So, a little bit of lactic acid is good! It's only a problem if you have too much of it, which can make your muscles sore. 



"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* The Gunpowder Plot was an attempt to blow up the English Parliament in 1605. It was led by Catholics who were angry with King James I.
* Mary, Queen of Scots, was executed in 1587, long before the Gunpowder Plot. 
*  Even though Mary was executed, she had a son, James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England.  So her bloodline continued.

Here's why:

* **Masonic Lodges are for grown-ups:**  Masons are part of a secret society for men who are usually adults. Alice is a little girl.

"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Snow White doesn't get to choose.** The Evil Queen tricks her into eating the poisoned apple.  She doesn't know what's in it and can't say yes or no.
* **It's not okay to force someone to do something.** Even if it seems like a small thing, like taking a bite of an apple, it's important to always ask for permission first.

"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Zoroastrianism** and **Islam** are two different religions. 
* The **Quran** is the holy book of **Islam**. 
* People who follow Zoroastrianism have their own holy book called the **Avesta**. 

It's like asking if a Christian would consult the Torah for religious guidance. They wouldn't because they follow different religions. 



"
"I think the answer is **(B) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Being a famous actress doesn't mean you can't be smart!**  Lots of people are good at different things. 
* **The University of Pennsylvania is really good**, but it's for smart people in general, not just actors.
* **Brooke Shields is a grown-up now**, so she could go to college if she wanted to.

Kidneys are pretty small, but I don't know how small a quarter is compared to them.  Maybe we could look it up?

* **Messiah** is a really serious and important musical piece about Jesus.

* **Greek alphabet** is used for writing Greek and many other languages today, like English!  It's pretty common.
* **Sumerian cuneiform** is an ancient writing system used thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia.  Not many people use it anymore. 


So, the Greek alphabet is way more common than Sumerian cuneiform.

It depends a lot on where you are and who you're with. 

* **Some people** see the crucifixion as a very important religious symbol and would find it disrespectful to wear it casually. 
* **Other people** might not see it as a big deal and wouldn't mind.

It's probably best to **think about the people around you** and what they might think before wearing something like that.  You don't want to offend anyone. 

Maybe it's better to stick with symbols that are more universally accepted. 

"
"(B) No

Dyslexia is a learning disability, not an intellectual disability.  

Here's why:

* **Intellectual disabilities** affect a person's overall thinking, learning, and problem-solving abilities. 
* **Dyslexia** is a specific learning disability that makes it hard to read and understand words. 

People with dyslexia are usually very intelligent, they just learn differently. 

"
"The answer is **(B) Yes**. 

Here's why:

Jackie Chan is famous for his action movies, which rely a lot on physical comedy and stunts.  He doesn't usually talk a lot in his movies.  

Deaf people can't hear, so they wouldn't be able to understand him if he was just making sounds or acting things out.  He would need to use sign language or writing to communicate. 



"
"The answer is **(B) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Florida is warmer:** Florida is known for its warm weather, even in the winter. 
* **New York gets cold:** New York has cold winters with snow and freezing temperatures.

Hypothermia happens when your body gets too cold, so you're more likely to get it in a place that's really cold.

* **Binary numbers** are just 0s and 1s.  They're easy to guess, especially if the password is short.
* **The standard alphabet**  has only 26 letters.  Passwords using just letters are also easy to crack.

Strong passwords need to be long and use a mix of:

* **Uppercase and lowercase letters**
* **Numbers**
* **Symbols** 

This makes them much harder for computers to guess.
"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

Rainbows need sunlight and raindrops to form.  You usually see them when the sun is out and there are rain clouds nearby.

Nancy Drew solves mysteries and looks into things for people, which is what private investigators do! 
"
"I'd say **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Different Parties:** Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and Gerald Ford was a Republican.  Usually, people from different political parties don't agree on things.
* **Different Times:** They lived in different political eras.  Things were different back when Ford was president. 

It's hard to say for sure without knowing exactly what issue we're talking about, but it's likely they wouldn't have always seen eye to eye. 

"
"I'd say **(A) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* Gunpowder explosions are really powerful. 
*  Big explosions create a lot of pressure that spreads out really fast.
*  When something moves faster than the speed of sound, it makes a sonic boom, which is a shock wave.

So, a big explosion like that would probably make a supersonic shock wave.

"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Kami Rita** is a famous Sherpa climber who has climbed Mount Everest a record number of times. That means he's super experienced and strong!
* **Mount Emei** is a beautiful mountain in China, but it's not as tall or as dangerous as Everest. 

So, it would be pretty easy for someone as skilled as Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei. 

"
"The answer is **(B) No**.

"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* Basel is in Switzerland, and Los Angeles is in California. They are in different parts of the world.

*  During the day, when it's sunny in Los Angeles, it's also daytime in Basel. 



"
"This is a tricky question! 

Here's why:

* **Spirit** is probably talking about a ghost or something supernatural.
* **News** is about real events that happen in the world.

Ghosts aren't real, so a broadcast from one wouldn't be a real event.

* **Religions take a long time to develop:**  Religions usually have roots that go back centuries, even thousands of years.  They grow and change over time, but they don't just pop up suddenly in a single century.
* **The Himalayas are very old:** The Himalayas are a mountain range that formed millions of years ago.  People have lived in and around them for a very long time.

Think about it like this: religions are like big, old trees. They have deep roots and take a long time to grow.  The Himalayas are like a giant, ancient mountain. They wouldn't have suddenly become sacred in the 19th century!

* **Beavers** have big teeth for gnawing on wood, but they're not as long or sharp as a Smilodon's.

Rivers are super important for farming! They provide water to grow crops and help transport things like food and tools.

* **Talking to your doctor:** They can give you information and advice on how to stay safe.

All of these things can help reduce the spread of STIs.

I've learned about both Jesus and some Egyptian myths in school.  There are some similarities, like stories about a god being born to a virgin and rising from the dead.  

But, I think it's more likely that these stories developed separately because people all over the world have similar ideas about good and evil, life and death.  

So, I'd say **(B) No**. 

"
"The answer is **(A) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Methuselah** lived a really, really long time according to the Bible. 
* The **Common Era (CE)** is a way of counting years starting from the year Jesus was born.

Since Methuselah lived way before Jesus, his long lifespan would still be a record even if we're talking about years in the Common Era.

"Here's how I'd think about this:

* **Largest bone:** The femur (thigh bone) is the largest bone.  It's in the leg, not the torso.

Karl Marx was a really important thinker who came up with a lot of ideas about how society works and how it could be changed.  The Communist Party of China was founded based on his ideas about communism.

* **Andy Warhol** was an artist who became famous much later, in the 1960s and 1970s. His style was very different, focusing on pop culture and using things like silkscreen printing.

The Forbidden City is called that because only the Emperor and his family were allowed to live there.  Regular people weren't allowed in.

Oscar Wilde was punished really harshly for being gay.  Back then, being gay was illegal in England, and he was put in jail for it.  Today, in the US, being gay is not a crime.  

It seems unfair to me that someone would be punished for who they love.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Jaguar F-Type:** This is a sports car, known for being sleek and stylish, but not very spacious. 
* **Family:**  Barack Obama has two daughters, so we're talking about at least 4 people.

Sports cars usually have two seats.  

**Answer:** (B) No 


The Obama family wouldn't fit comfortably in a 2020 Jaguar F-Type.

Here's why:

The double-slit experiment is a cool science experiment that shows how light acts like a wave.  You can do a simplified version of it at home with some stuff you probably already have! 

You'd need:

* **A laser pointer:** This is your light source.
* **A piece of cardboard:** To make the slits.
* **A screen:**  A white wall or piece of paper will work.

You make two tiny slits in the cardboard and shine the laser pointer through them. The light will spread out on the screen and make an interesting pattern of bright and dark lines. 

It won't be as fancy as the real experiment, but it shows the same basic idea!

So, it's unlikely someone with that title would have been around during the Hundred Years' War.

"
"The answer is most likely **(B) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Military academies are very physically demanding.**  They require a lot of strength, endurance, and the ability to handle tough conditions. 
* **Multiple sclerosis (MS) can affect a person's physical abilities.** It's a disease that attacks the nervous system, which can lead to problems with balance, coordination, and muscle strength.

While some people with MS live full and active lives, it's unlikely the military would accept someone whose condition could make it difficult to meet the academy's rigorous standards. 


It's important to remember that I'm just guessing based on my understanding.  The best way to know for sure would be to check the US Military Academy's official website or talk to a recruiter.

Here's why:

* **Starbucks in China is different:**  While Starbucks is a global company, they change their menus to fit what people in different countries like.

"
"The answer is **(B) No**. 

Here's why:

Diamonds are really, really dense.  That means they pack a lot of weight into a small space.  Water is less dense, so things that are denser than water sink.  Think about it like this: a rock sinks, and a diamond is even heavier than a rock!

Here's why:

* **Rich people have a lot of money:** Billionaires have a huge amount of money.

* **Thirty Years' War:**  That was a big war in Europe a long time ago, from 1618 to 1648.

Here's why:

* **Harry Potter** made a TON of money from the movies, books, toys, and everything else. It's like, a HUGE money-maker for Warner Bros.

Ukemi is about rolling and falling safely, right?  Kinetic energy is about how much energy something has because it's moving.  

I guess it would slow you down, but I don't know if it stops all the energy.  Maybe it changes the energy into something else? 


I'd have to ask someone who knows more about physics! 

"
"I'm not sure about that. I don't really follow the news about the royal family that closely.  

It's important to remember that ""allegedly"" means someone is accused of something, but it doesn't mean they actually did it.

"
"(B) No 

Here's why:

* The NY Stock Exchange is in New York City.
* Universal Music Group's headquarters is in the Netherlands.

"(B) Yes 

I've read some of The Jungle Book, and some parts make me uncomfortable.  The way the author talks about some of the characters, especially the ones who are different, can seem pretty prejudiced.  It's important to remember that books from a long time ago sometimes have ideas that aren't okay today. 

"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

During the 1980s in China, there was a policy called the One-Child Policy. This meant that most families were only allowed to have one child.

Bruiser Brody was a wrestler who was popular in the 1980s, but he wrestled for different wrestling companies like the World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). WWE Raw didn't start until 1993, after Bruiser Brody sadly passed away in 1988. 



"
"I'd say (B) No. 

Here's why:

* **Sables are wild animals.**  It's not nice to keep them trapped or use them for something like weighing things. 
* **They're pretty small.**  Even a big sable wouldn't be very heavy. You'd need something much bigger to weigh down a scale. 


Let's think of something else to use!  Maybe some heavy rocks or a big bag of sand?

Here's why:

* **James Cotton plays the harmonica.**

"
"I'd say **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* I remember learning about the Great Depression in history class. It was way worse than the Great Recession.  Lots of people lost their jobs and homes back then. 

While the Great Recession was really tough, it wasn't as bad as the Great Depression.

The Last Supper is a very important event in Christianity, but it's not celebrated in Islam.  Muslims have their own important religious events and beliefs. 
"
"I'm not sure.  

I know that serfs in both Japan and England were tied to the land and had to work for their lords. But I don't know enough about the specific differences between the two to say which one had a higher status.

"I don't know the answer to this question.  

I know Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States. But I don't know who Elagabalus was or what Emperor number he had.  

To answer the question, I'd need to look that up! 

"
"That's a really tough question.  

I haven't read *The Catcher in the Rye* myself, but I know it's a famous book and people talk about it a lot.  

It's hard to say for sure if any book could *make* someone become a killer. People do bad things for lots of different reasons.  

Maybe some people who commit crimes feel like the main character, Holden Caulfield, and feel misunderstood or angry. But that doesn't mean the book *caused* them to do anything. 

It's probably more complicated than that. 

"
"I'm not sure.  I know Disneyland in California is really big, and I think Walt Disney World in Florida is even bigger.

Here's why:

* Venus is super hot!  Like, way hotter than any place on Earth. You couldn't even stand on the surface.
* Venus also has a thick, cloudy atmosphere that's made mostly of poisonous gas.  

Water skiing needs water, and you'd definitely melt before you could even get close to the surface of Venus!

"I'm not sure about that.  I know the Carnation Revolution was a big deal in Portugal, but I don't know if it was the deadliest revolution in all of Europe.  There have been a lot of revolutions in Europe throughout history! 


I'd need to do some more research to know for sure. 

"
"(B) Yes 

Here's why:

* **The Red Sea is really deep:** The deepest point is super far down, way deeper than a person could swim.
* **People need special equipment:** To go that deep, you need a special submarine or diving suit that can handle the pressure.

* **King Manuel I of Portugal** was the king in 1515.
* **King Henry VIII of England** was a Tudor.
* **Manuel I's daughter, Mary, married Henry VIII's older brother, Arthur.**  

Even though the marriage was short-lived (Arthur died young), it means they were related through marriage.

"
"This is a trick question! 

Sugar Ray Robinson was a famous boxer, but that doesn't mean he could box *anywhere* he wanted.  

Here's why:

* **Stealing is wrong:**  It's against the law, and Sugar Ray Robinson would get in trouble.
* **Boxing is a sport:**  You need to be in a boxing match to box. Stealing wouldn't make that happen.


So the answer is **(A) No**. 
"
"I'd say **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Cheetahs are fast, but not super strong.** They're built for speed, not power.
* **Big Show is HUGE and heavy.**  He's a professional wrestler, so he's trained to be strong and tough.

Even if a cheetah could get a good jump on Big Show, I don't think it could push him over.

"
"(A) Yes 

Here's why:

Woodrow Wilson was president during a time when ""separate but equal"" was the law of the land.  He didn't do much to fight against segregation, even though some people thought it was unfair.  So it's likely he would have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. 

"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **The XXII Olympic Games** were held in Moscow, USSR in 1980.
* **The Atlantic** is a magazine published in the United States.

During the Cold War, there was a lot of tension between the US and the USSR.  The US boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics, so it's unlikely I would have been able to get my hands on a copy of The Atlantic magazine there. 



"
"The answer is **(A) No**.

"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

King Arthur is a legendary figure from British history, and he lived long before Anne Boleyn. Anne Boleyn was beheaded in the 1530s, while King Arthur is said to have lived in the 5th or 6th century.  

"
"The answer is **(A) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Being paraplegic means someone can't use their legs.**  
* **Conducting an orchestra is mostly about using your arms and hands to give signals.**

So, a paraplegic person could definitely learn to conduct!  They might use a special chair or stand, but it wouldn't stop them from being a great conductor. 

"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Tenzing Norgay** was a famous mountain climber who helped conquer Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain in the world! 
* **Snowdon** is a mountain in Wales, and while it's the highest mountain in Wales, it's much smaller than Everest.

Even though Snowdon is a challenge, it would be pretty easy for someone as experienced as Tenzing Norgay.

Here's why:

* Boris Yeltsin was the president of Russia from 1991 to 1999. 
* He died in 2007.

"
"(B) Yes 

They both seem kinda grumpy and strict, and they both have a hidden good side that comes out later.  
"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Driving Laws:**  You need to be a certain age to get a driver's license, and that age is way older than middle school. 
* **Child Labor Laws:** There are also laws about how old you have to be to work.  

It wouldn't be safe or legal for a middle schooler to drive a fancy car and work at the same time! 

"
"(B) No 

Here's why:

Donald Duck is a cartoon character.  He's not a real person, so he probably wouldn't be allowed in a grocery store.

Here's why:

Retail can be tough!  You need to be good at talking to people, helping them find things, and dealing with customers who might be grumpy.  Some people just don't like that kind of work.  

Plus, it can be tiring standing on your feet all day and working weekends and holidays.  

So, while some people love retail, it's not for everyone. 

"
"I'd say **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

* **Different Times, Different Ships:**  The Battle of Actium happened a long, long time ago.  The ships back then were totally different from modern warships.  They were slower, smaller, and didn't have the same weapons.  

* **Numbers Matter:** Even if the Brazilian Navy had super-advanced ships, they'd probably be outnumbered.  The Roman and Egyptian fleets at Actium were huge!

* **Strategy is Key:**  Battles aren't just about having the strongest ships.  It's about strategy and knowing the enemy.  The Brazilian Navy wouldn't know the Roman tactics or the waters around Actium.


It's fun to think about, but it's unlikely the Brazilian Navy could have changed the outcome of a battle that happened so long ago!
