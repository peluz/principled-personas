**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the first house. 

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan driver.  Since we know the tea drinker is in the first house, the apple eater can't be in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The orange eater doesn't live in the second house.

**3.  Deduce:**

*  We know the tea drinker is in house 1.  
*  The apple eater can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2.
*  The orange eater can't be in house 2, so they must be in house 3.

**4.  Continue using clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The convertible driver lives to the right of the science fiction fan. This means the science fiction fan can't be in house 3.
* **Clue 4:** There's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker.

"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 4 tells us the person who likes red lives in the second house.** 

* **Clue 1 tells us the red-lover lives left of the mystery book reader.**  This means the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

* **Clue 2 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house.**

* **Clue 3 tells us the white-lover doesn't live in the third house.**

Putting it all together:

* House 1:  Can't be red or white, so it must be the fantasy book enthusiast.
* House 2: Red lover
* House 3: Mystery book reader


**So the answer is (C) 1**

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 7:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2.

**2.  Build upon those clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The television is to the left of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 4:** The television is to the left of the guitarist.  
* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker doesn't live in house 2.

   These clues tell us the order must be: Television - Tea Drinker - Guitarist.

* **Clue 5:** There's one house between the flutist and the banana eater.

**3.  Combine clues:**

* We know the order of Television - Tea Drinker - Guitarist.  
*  We also know the rose bouquet is in house 2, so the tea drinker must be in house 3.
*  This means the television is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

**4.  Deduce the rest:**

*  Clue 2: The kiwi eater is to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the kiwi eater must be in house 3.
*  Clue 6: The tulips are to the right of the radio.  Since the television is in house 1, the radio must be in house 1.

**5.  Final Solution:**

Now we can fill in all the blanks:

* House 1: Television, Radio, Apples
* House 2: Rose Bouquet, Guitarist, Banana
* House 3: Tea, Tulips, Kiwi

**Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.**

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
* **Clue 1:** The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in house 2.
* **Clue 3:** The person wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person eating apples.
* **Clue 4:** The person eating apples does not live in the third house.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 8:** The person eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the banana eater lives in either house 4 or 1.

**3.  Deduce further:**

* **Clue 5:** The person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals. This means the mango eater and sandal wearer are in consecutive houses.
* **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person eating apples lives and where the person wearing boots lives.

**4.  Consider all possibilities:**

Since we know the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 3, history in house 2, and apples aren't in house 3, the only remaining spot for apples is house 1.  

This means the running shoe wearer is in house 2.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:

*  The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast (house 3).
*  The banana eater lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

The only place left for the science fiction book fanatic is **house 4**.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Clue 1:** Lilies are not in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The television is in the first house.

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** Science fiction fan is left of the golfer.
* **Clue 2:** Pizza eater and history buff are next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** Guitarist is right of the daffodil person.

"Let's break down the clues and see if we can figure out where everyone lives!

**Here's what we know so far:**

* **House 4:** Violinist lives here.
* **House 5:** Bird keeper lives here.

**Let's use the clues to fill in more:**

* **Clue 7:** Television is to the left of Gameboy.
* **Clue 1:** Gameboy is to the right of the Guitarist.
* **Clue 6:** Guitarist is to the right of the Percussionist.

**Putting those together:**

We can see that the order has to be: Percussionist - Guitarist - Television - Gameboy

* **Clue 4:** Flutist is to the left of the Television.

**So now we have:**

Percussionist - Guitarist - Flutist - Television - Gameboy

* **Clue 2:** Dog owner is NOT in house 2.
* **Clue 3:** Fish enthusiast and Horse owner are next to each other.

**We need to figure out where these fit in:**

We know the order of the last four houses, so the Dog owner, Fish enthusiast, and Horse owner must be in houses 1 and 3.

* **Clue 9:** Two houses between Phone and Horse owner.

**This means:**

Phone - Dog owner -  Fish enthusiast - Horse owner -  

* **Clue 5:** Television is to the left of the Radio.

**We can now place the Radio:**

Phone - Dog owner -  Fish enthusiast - Horse owner -  Television - Gameboy - Radio

* **Clue 8:** Violinist lives in house 4.

**This means:**

Phone - Dog owner -  Fish enthusiast - Horse owner -  Television - Gameboy - Radio - Violinist

* **Clue 10:** Bird keeper lives in house 5.

**This means:**

Phone - Dog owner -  Fish enthusiast - Horse owner -  Television - Gameboy - Radio - Violinist - Bird keeper



**Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1.**



**Answer: (E) 1**"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 3 tells us:** The person with lilies lives in house 1.
* **Clue 4 tells us:** The basketball player doesn't live in house 1.

Now let's look at the clues about the radio:

* **Clue 1:** The radio is to the right of the apple eater.
* **Clue 2:** The radio is to the right of the violinist.

Since the lilies are in house 1, the radio can't be in house 1.  This means the radio must be in house 2.

**Therefore, the violinist must live in house 1.**


The answer is **(A) 1**.

* **Clue 3:** Golfer lives in house 4.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 7:** Tennis player (house 3) is left of the soccer player.  This means the soccer player must live in house 4 or 5.
* **Clue 4:**  Fried rice and spaghetti are one house apart.

**3.  Deduce:**

* Since the golfer is in house 4, the soccer player must be in house 5.
*  The fried rice and spaghetti eaters must be in houses 1, 2, and 3.
*  Clue 6 tells us stew is directly left of spaghetti.

**4.  Final Solution:**

* **Clue 3:** Gameboy person is left of the mystery book reader.

We don't know for sure which house is which yet, but we can start putting things together. 

Since we have to figure out the house with the rose bouquet, let's think about where it *could* be. 

**Think about it this way:**

* If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover would have to be in house 2.  

Let me know if you want to try figuring out more! 



"
"Let's try to figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** Minivan is to the right of the fish enthusiast.
* **Clue 2:** Truck is directly left of the sedan, and there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
* **Clue 3:** Fish enthusiast is directly left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 4:** Cat lover is not in the second house.

Let's use these clues to make a little chart:

```
House | Person | Pet | Car
-------|--------|------|------
1     |        |       |       
2     |        |       |       
3     |        |       |       
4     |        |       |       
```

We can start filling in some blanks:

* **Clue 3:**  Truck - Sedan  (we don't know their exact positions yet)
* **Clue 4:** Fish - Dog  (they are next to each other)

Now let's think about Clue 1: Minivan is to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the fish enthusiast and dog owner can't be in the last house (house 4).

Putting it all together, here's a possible arrangement:

```
House | Person | Pet | Car
-------|--------|------|------
1     |        |       |       
2     |        |       |       
3     | Fish   |       |       
4     | Dog    |       |       
```

We still need to figure out the truck, sedan, cat lover, and horses.  But we know the **dog owner lives in house 4**. 


**So the answer is (A) 4** 
"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 5 tells us the yellow lover lives in house 3.**

* **Clue 2 says the yellow lover is to the left of the milk lover.**  So the milk lover must live in house 4.

* **Clue 1 says the blue lover is to the right of the yellow lover.**  This means the blue lover lives in house 4.




**Answer:** The person who likes blue lives in house **(B) 4**. 
"

* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives to the left of the green lover.
* **Clue 5:** The sandal wearer lives to the right of the dog owner.
* **Clue 7:** The loafer wearer lives to the right of the grape eater.

House 1: ?
House 2: Computer
House 3: Tulips
House 4: Roses

* **Clue 2:** Radio is to the left of pizza.
* **Clue 3:** Root beer isn't in house 1.
* **Clue 4:** Grapes are to the left of the computer.

Let's use these clues to make a guess! 

Since we don't know for sure where the radio and truck are, let's try putting them in different places and see if it works with the other clues. 

**Let's try this:**

* **House 1:**  Maybe the person here has the computer and grapes.
* **House 2:** Maybe the person here has the radio and truck.

This fits with Clue 4 (grapes left of computer) and Clue 1 (radio and truck together).

Now let's see if Clue 2 works:

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.

These clues tell us the order has to be: Milk - Spaghetti - Water

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.

This means the water drinker and the white-lover are together, and they must be to the right of the spaghetti eater.

**3.  Fill in the rest:**

* We know the tea drinker is in house 1, and the pizza eater is in house 2.
* The order has to be Milk - Spaghetti - Water, and they must be to the right of the pizza eater.
* This leaves house 3 for the milk drinker and house 4 for the spaghetti eater and water drinker.
*  **Clue 7:** The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Start with the knowns:**

    * House 4: Television
    * House 2: Loafers

* **Use the clues:**

    * Clue 3 tells us the phone is NOT in house 2.
    * Clue 4 tells us boots are to the left of loafers (house 2).

* **Deduce:**

    * Since boots are to the left of loafers, they must be in house 1.
    *  We know the phone isn't in house 2, and the television is in house 4, so the phone must be in either house 1 or 3.

* **Final Steps:**

    * Clue 5 says there are two houses between the radio and sandals.  This means the radio can't be in house 1 (because then there wouldn't be two houses between it and sandals).  
    * Therefore, the radio must be in house 3.
    * This leaves house 2 for the gameboy.



**Answer:** The person with the gameboy lives in **house 2 (A)**.

"Let's try to figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** Tulips are NOT in house #3.
* **Clue 2:** SUV is next to Lilies.
* **Clue 3:** Sedan and Rose Bouquet are next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** Rose Bouquet is NOT in house #2.

Let's use these clues to make a little chart:

```
House # | Flower   | Car      
------- | -------- | --------
   1    |         |          
   2    |         |          
   3    |         |          
```

We can start filling in some blanks:

* Since the Rose Bouquet isn't in house #2, it must be in house #1 or #3.

* The SUV and Lilies are together, so they can't be in house #1 or #3.

* The Sedan and Rose Bouquet are together, so they must be in house #1 and #2.

Now our chart looks like this:

```
House # | Flower   | Car      
------- | -------- | --------
   1    | Rose     | Sedan    
   2    |         | SUV      
   3    |         | Truck    
```

* We know Tulips aren't in house #3, so they must be in house #1 or #2.

* Since the Rose Bouquet is already in house #1, the Tulips must be in house #2.

* This leaves Lilies for house #3.

*  And since the SUV is next to the Lilies, the SUV must be in house #2.



Our final chart looks like this:

```
House # | Flower   | Car      
------- | -------- | --------
   1    | Rose     | Sedan    
   2    | Tulips   | SUV      
   3    | Lilies   | Truck

* **Clue 2:** The flutist is to the right of the violinist.
* **Clue 3:** There's one house between the grape eater and the kiwi eater.
* **Clue 4:** There's one house between the violinist and the kiwi eater.

Let's use these clues to make a little chart:

```
House 1  House 2  House 3
      
```

We can start by placing the kiwi eater somewhere.  Since we know they are next to the pianist, and there's a house between them and the grape eater, let's try this:

```
House 1  House 2  House 3
      Kiwi  Pianist  Grape

**4.  Fill in the rest:**

* **Clue 8:** Daffodils and running shoes are together, so running shoes are in house 1.
* **Clue 4:** One house between lilies and running shoes means lilies are in house 2.

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots lives directly left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 6:** The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. 

   This means the person wearing boots can't be in the third house (because there's no house to their left).
