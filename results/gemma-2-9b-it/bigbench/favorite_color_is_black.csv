| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**2. Fill in the table based on the clues:**

* **Clue 1:** Running shoes are not in house 1.
* **Clue 2:** White-lover is to the left of the spaghetti eater.
* **Clue 3:** Baseball player and spaghetti eater are next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** Water-drinker and spaghetti eater are next to each other.

Let's start with the most direct clues:

| House | Person | Lunch | Color | Drink | Sport | Shoes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Now, consider Clue 2 and Clue 4 together.  Since the white-lover is to the left of the spaghetti eater, and the water-drinker is next to the spaghetti eater, this means:

* House 1: White, Water
* House 2: Spaghetti, Milk

| House | Person | Lunch | Color | Drink | Sport | Shoes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  | White | Water |  |  |
| 2 |  | Spaghetti |  | Milk |  |  |

Clue 3 tells us the baseball player and spaghetti eater are next to each other.  This means:

| House | Person | Lunch | Color | Drink | Sport | Shoes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  | White | Water |  |  |
| 2 |  | Spaghetti |  | Milk | Baseball |  |

**3. Deduce the rest:**

* Since running shoes are not in house 1, they must be in house 2.
* The only remaining color is red.
* The only remaining sport is swimming.
* The only remaining shoes are loafers.

Here's why:

* **Alcoholism as a Theme:**  ""Rick and Morty"" frequently deals with themes of addiction, both to substances like alcohol and to more abstract things. Rick's alcoholism is a central part of his character, and it often manifests in destructive and harmful ways. 

* **Dark Humor and Violence:** The show uses dark humor and graphic violence, which can be disturbing for children, especially those who have experienced the trauma of a parent's alcoholism.

* **Complex Relationships:**  The show explores complex family relationships, including the strained relationship between Rick and his daughter, Beth, who is also struggling with her own issues. This can be triggering for children of alcoholics who may have experienced similar dynamics in their own families.

**It's important to note:**

* Every child is different, and what is triggering for one child may not be triggering for another.

"The answer is **(B) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Voldemort's Beliefs:** Voldemort was obsessed with pure-blood supremacy and saw Muggle-borns as inferior.  He believed in a rigid hierarchy within the wizarding world.

* **Hogwarts' Founder's Intent:** While the founders of Hogwarts (Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin) had different views, they all aimed to create a school for witches and wizards of all backgrounds.  

* **Slytherin's Legacy:**  Salazar Slytherin, whose values aligned most closely with Voldemort's,  wanted to restrict Hogwarts to pure-bloods. However, the other founders opposed this, and ultimately, Hogwarts was founded as a school open to all magical children.

* **Voldemort's Actions:** Voldemort's actions, including his pursuit of power and his brutal treatment of those he deemed ""lesser,"" directly contradict the values of inclusivity and fairness that Hogwarts, despite its complexities, strives for.


Therefore, even though Voldemort was a Slytherin, his extreme beliefs and actions would likely have been deemed unacceptable by the Hogwarts founders and the school's overall ethos.

"Here's a breakdown of why the answer is likely (A) Yes, and a bit of fun with the mythology:

* **Iris (mythology):**  Iris is the Greek goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. While fast and swift, her role is more about delivering messages, not physical packages.  She might struggle with the logistics, organization, and potentially repetitive nature of a UPS job.

* **Hermes:** Hermes is the Greek god of messengers, travelers, thieves, and commerce. He's known for his speed and cunning.  He might be good at delivering packages quickly, but his history as a trickster god could lead to some... interesting situations with customers or lost packages.

**In short:**

While Hermes' speed and Iris's communication skills might be assets, their mythological roles don't directly translate to the practical demands of a UPS job.

To answer your question about bull shark and crocodile bites, it's difficult to say definitively which hurts worse. Both are incredibly powerful predators with strong jaws and sharp teeth. 

Here's why it's hard to compare:

* **Bite force:** Both bull sharks and crocodiles have immense bite force, but crocodiles generally have a stronger bite.
* **Teeth:** Crocodile teeth are designed for tearing flesh, while bull shark teeth are more serrated, which can cause more tearing and damage.
* **Individual variation:** The severity of a bite depends on factors like the size of the animal, the location of the bite, and the individual's pain tolerance.

**Ultimately, a bite from either animal would be extremely dangerous and painful.** 

It's best to avoid encounters with both bull sharks and crocodiles to stay safe.

* **Video Quality:**  Netflix shows come in different qualities (SD, HD, 4K).  Higher quality means bigger file sizes.
* **Average File Size:**  A rough estimate is:
    * SD: 1GB per hour
    * HD: 3GB per hour
    * 4K: 7GB per hour

**Calculations:**

* **SD:** 10 hours * 1GB/hour = 10GB per day
* **HD:** 10 hours * 3GB/hour = 30GB per day
* **4K:** 10 hours * 7GB/hour = 70GB per day

**Conclusion:**

* **SD:**  500GB is enough for a long time!
* **HD:** 500GB would last about 16 days (500GB / 30GB/day).

Here's why:

* **ASL is a visual language:** It relies on handshapes, facial expressions, and body language, not primarily on spoken language or hand dominance.
* **Both right- and left-handed individuals can use ASL fluently:**  While some signers might have a slight preference for one hand over the other, ASL is designed to be used equally well by both hands.

To answer your question about art in the US education system, it's complex. 

**There's no simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.**

Here's why:

* **Varying Importance:** The prioritization of art varies greatly depending on the state, school district, and individual school. Some schools have robust art programs with dedicated teachers and facilities, while others have limited or even nonexistent art offerings.
* **Budget Constraints:**  Funding for the arts often gets cut during budget reductions, impacting the quality and availability of art education.
* **Standardized Testing:** The emphasis on standardized testing in the US can sometimes overshadow the importance of arts education, as schools focus on core academic subjects.
* **Growing Recognition:** There's a growing movement to recognize the importance of arts education for cognitive development, creativity, and well-roundedness.

**In conclusion:** While art is considered an important part of a well-rounded education by many, its prioritization in the US education system is inconsistent and faces challenges.

* **Immigration Policies:** Britain's immigration policies favored Jewish immigration, which angered the Arab population and contributed to tensions.
* **The 1947 UN Partition Plan:** Britain proposed a plan to partition Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. While the Jewish leadership accepted the plan, the Arab leadership rejected it, leading to further conflict.
* **The 1948 Arab-Israeli War:** When Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, war broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

While a portfolio can be very helpful for a construction worker to showcase their skills and experience, it's not typically a *requirement* for the job. 

Here's why:

* **Experience speaks volumes:** Construction work is often about hands-on experience and proven abilities. 
* **On-the-job training:** Many construction jobs involve apprenticeships or on-the-job training where skills are developed and demonstrated directly.
* **References and work history:**  Employers usually rely on references, work history, and skills assessments to evaluate a construction worker's qualifications.


A portfolio can be a great asset for a construction worker, especially if they are:

* **Starting out:** It can help them stand out and demonstrate their potential.
* **Specializing in a niche:**  A portfolio can showcase their expertise in a specific area, like carpentry or welding.
* **Seeking higher-level positions:**  A strong portfolio can be helpful when applying for supervisory or management roles.

To answer your question about Harry Potter vs. The Matrix for Warner Bros., it's impossible to say definitively which was a ""better"" investment without access to their financial records.  

Here's why:

* **""Better"" is subjective:**  What makes an investment ""better"" depends on the criteria used. Is it purely profit? Box office gross? Cultural impact? Longevity? 
* **Complex Factors:**  Investment success involves many factors beyond just the initial film's performance.  Things like merchandise, sequels, theme parks, and streaming rights all contribute to long-term profitability.

**However, we can look at some general points:**

* **Harry Potter:** The Harry Potter franchise is undeniably massive, with billions in box office revenue and a vast merchandising empire. It's likely a very successful investment for Warner Bros.
* **The Matrix:** The Matrix was also a huge success, both critically and commercially. While its sequels didn't reach the same heights, it still spawned a significant franchise.

**Conclusion:**

Both Harry Potter and The Matrix were likely very profitable for Warner Bros. Determining which was ""better"" requires a deeper financial analysis and depends on how you define success.

To answer your question about serfdom in Japan and England, it's complex and there's no simple ""higher"" or ""lower"" status.  Here's why:

* **Different Systems:**  Japanese and English serfdom were structured differently. 
    * **Japan:**  The *samurai* class held power, and peasants (farmers) were tied to the land they worked. They had some rights and protections, but were obligated to serve their lords.
    * **England:**  Serfs were tied to a lord's manor and owed labor, rent, and other services. They had fewer rights and were more vulnerable to exploitation.

* **Varying Conditions:**  Conditions for serfs varied greatly depending on the specific lord, region, and time period in both countries.

**Conclusion:**

It's inaccurate to say one system was definitively ""higher"" than the other. Both involved a hierarchical social structure with limited freedoms for the serfs.

* **Alters and Memory:** In DID, different ""alters"" (alternate identities) may have their own memories and experiences. This can make it difficult to piece together a complete and accurate picture of a person's past.

* **Technological Disparity:** The Battle of Actium (31 BC) was fought with ancient Roman and Ptolemaic fleets using triremes and other ships of that era. Modern Brazilian Navy ships, with their advanced technology, would be vastly superior in firepower, speed, and maneuverability. However, this technological gap wouldn't automatically translate to victory.

* **Strategic Context:**  The battle was a complex naval engagement influenced by factors like weather, terrain, and the political situation.  Modern naval tactics and strategies wouldn't necessarily be effective in that historical context.
