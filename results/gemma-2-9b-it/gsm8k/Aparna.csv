"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 3 hours**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours**

*  He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he travels 0 miles during this time.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the next half-hour**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining time for the last leg of the journey**

* Total time for the return trip = 4 hours
* Time spent in traffic + time at 30 mph = 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours
* Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled in the last 1.5 hours**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

**Step 6: Calculate the total distance traveled**

* Total distance = 180 miles (initial trip) + 0 miles (traffic) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 315 miles

* The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5
* The probability of rolling another even number after the first is also 0.5.
* The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

**3.  Difference in probability:**

* The difference in probability is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

**4.  Percentage difference:**

*  0.25 * 100% = 25%

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many offensive players as defensive players, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many special teams players as defensive players, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

* **Combine like terms:** (5/2)x = 105

* **Solve for x:**  Multiply both sides by (2/5): x = 42

   Half of the class likes blue, so 40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

* **Step 2: Find the number of pupils who don't like blue.**
   There are 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who don't like blue.

* **Step 3: Find the number of pupils who like green.**
   One-fourth of the pupils who don't like blue like green, so 20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

* **Step 4: Find the number of pupils who like yellow.**
   The rest of the pupils like yellow, so 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let:**

*  Bodhi's insects = B
*  David's insects = D
*  Lily's insects = L

**We know:**

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

**Now we can use substitution to solve for L:**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (L = D + 7) into the first equation:
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43

2. **Substitute** the third equation (D = B / 2) into the equation from step 1:
   (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Combine** like terms:

* **Funding for months 6-50:**
    * Month 6: $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000
    * Month 7: $150,000 + $50,000 = $200,000
    * ... and so on
* **Total cost:**  We need to calculate the sum of funding for all 50 months. This is an arithmetic series.

**Formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**

S = (n/2) * (a + l)

Where:

* S = sum of the series
* n = number of terms (50 months)
* a = first term ($100,000)
* l = last term (we need to calculate this)

**To find the last term (l):**

*  The last term is the funding for month 50.  We can use the formula: l = a + (n-1)d
    *  d = the common difference ($50,000)
    *  l = $100,000 + (50-1)*$50,000 = $2,450,000

* **Emma collects 'y' berries.**

* **Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects y + 3 berries.**

Now let's calculate their scores:

* **Ava's score:** (x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (z - 4) * 30

*  o + w = 17  (He bought 17 fish in total)

**3. Solve the system of equations:**

*  Simplify the second equation: 3 + o = 6 + 2w
*  Solve for 'o' in terms of 'w': o = 3 + 2w
*  Substitute this value of 'o' into the first equation: (3 + 2w) + w = 17

* S = A + 25

**Now we can use substitution to solve for F:**

**Step 1: Calculate the swimming distance**

* James swims 60% of 20 miles: 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the swimming time**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the resting time**

* Resting time = Swimming time / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance**

* Remaining distance = Total distance - Swum distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

**Step 5: Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance**

* Speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour
* Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the total time**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let:**

*  *A* = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught
*  *S* = the number of Pokemon Stan has caught
*  *X* = the number of Pokemon Alex has caught

**We know:**

*  *A* + *S* + *X* = 339 
*  *X* = *S* + 5
*  *S* = 4*A* - 13

**Now we can use substitution to solve for S:**

1. **Substitute** the value of *X* from the second equation into the first equation:
   *A* + *S* + (*S* + 5) = 339

2. **Substitute** the value of *S* from the third equation into the equation from step 1:
   *A* + (4*A* - 13) + (4*A* - 13 + 5) = 339

3. **Simplify** and solve for *A*:
   *A* + 4*A* - 13 + 4*A* - 8 = 339
   9*A* - 21 = 339
   9*A* = 360
   *A* = 40

4. **Substitute** the value of *A* back into the equation *S* = 4*A* - 13 to find *S*:
   *S* = 4 * 40 - 13
   *S* = 160 - 13
   *S* = 147

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, so it lost a total of 9 * 5 = 45% of its capacity.

**2. Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

*  Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* After 5 hours, the remaining charge is x - 0.45x = 0.55x

**3. Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, so it lost a total of 7 * 3 = 21% of its capacity.

**4.  Set up an equation to represent the final charge:**

* The remaining charge after 8 hours is 28%. This can be represented as: 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.28

**5. Solve for x (the initial charge):**

* Combine like terms: 0.34x = 0.28

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   * Colin's age in seven years: c + 7
   * Equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   * Colin's age in 25 years: c + 25
   * Wendy's age in 25 years: w + 25
   * Equation: c + 25 = (1/3)w

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   * w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   * c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   * 3c + 75 = 5c + 35

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and James is 18 now.  This means John's youngest son is 32 - 18 = 14 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, his youngest son will be 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.**

* **We know:**
    * c + w = 20 (total animals)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

* **Solve for 'c' (number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve the first equation for 'w':** 
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
