"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 3 hours**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip**

*  He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he travels 0 miles during this time.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the next half-hour**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining time for the return trip**

* Total return trip time = 4 hours
* Time spent in traffic + time at 30 mph = 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours
* Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled in the remaining 1.5 hours**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

**Step 6: Calculate the total distance traveled on the return trip**

* Total distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

**Step 7: Calculate the final distance from home**

* Since he drove 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

* **Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.**

* **Green house:** She sold x/3.
* **Red house:** She sold 2 more, so she had x/3 + 2 left.
* **Orange house:** She sold half of what was left, meaning she sold (x/3 + 2)/2.
* **Remaining:** She has 5 left, so  x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/3 + 2)/2 = 5

**Now, let's solve the equation:**

1. Simplify: x - x/3 - 2 - x/6 - 1 = 5
2. Combine like terms: (6x - 2x - 6 - x - 6)/6 = 5
3. Simplify further: (3x - 12)/6 = 5
4. Multiply both sides by 6: 3x - 12 = 30
5. Add 12 to both sides: 3x = 42
6. Divide both sides by 3: x = 14

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let:**

*  Bodhi's insects = B
*  David's insects = D
*  Lily's insects = L

**We know:**

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

**Now we can substitute to solve for L:**

1. **Substitute D in the first equation:** L + (B/2) + B = 43
2. **Simplify:** L + (3B/2) = 43
3. **Substitute L in the simplified equation:** (D + 7) + (3B/2) = 43
4. **Substitute D again:** (B/2 + 7) + (3B/2) = 43
5. **Combine like terms:** 2B + 7 = 43
6. **Subtract 7 from both sides:** 2B = 36
7. **Divide both sides by 2:** B = 18 
8. **Now that we know B, find D:** D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9
9. **Finally, find L:** L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

**1. Calculate the fifth-grade pass rate:**

* The fourth-grade pass rate was 40/100 = 40%
* The fifth-grade pass rate was twice that, so it was 40% * 2 = 80%

**2. Calculate the number of fifth graders who passed:**

* 80% of 400 fifth graders is (80/100) * 400 = 320 students

**3. Calculate the total number of students who passed:**

* Total students who passed: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students

**4. Calculate the total number of students:**

* Total students: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students

    * S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
    * S = A + 25      (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
    * A = F - 12      (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

* **Substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:**
    * (A + 25) + A + F = 85

* **Simplify and solve for F:**
    * 2A + F + 25 = 85
    * 2A + F = 60
    * Since A = F - 12, substitute that in: 2(F - 12) + F = 60
    * 2F - 24 + F = 60
    * 3F - 24 = 60
    * 3F = 84

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let:**

*  *A* = the number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  *S* = the number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  *W* = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  *A + S + W = 339*  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  *A = S + 5*  (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  *S = 4W - 13* (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the values of *A* and *S* from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   *(S + 5) + S + W = 339*

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   *2S + W = 334*

3. **Solve for W** in terms of S using the third equation:
   *W = (S + 13) / 4*

4. **Substitute** this value of *W* into the simplified equation from step 2:
   *2S + ((S + 13) / 4) = 334*

5. **Multiply** both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
   *8S + (S + 13) = 1336*

6. **Combine** like terms:
   *9S + 13 = 1336*

7. **Subtract** 13 from both sides:
   *9S = 1323*

8. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   *S = 147*

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be ""B""
    * Let Bill's father's current age be ""F""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  F + 75 = B  (Bill's father saw the comet 75 years ago, so his current age plus 75 is Bill's current age)
    *  B = 3F  (Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age)

* **Solve for B (Bill's current age):**
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: F + 75 = 3F
    * Subtract F from both sides: 75 = 2F
    * Divide both sides by 2: F = 37.5 
    * Now that you know F, plug it back into either equation to find B. Let's use B = 3F: B = 3 * 37.5 = 112.5

* **Find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
    *  Subtract 75 years from Bill's current age: 112.5 - 75 = 37.5

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) cm long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm, so:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

**Solve for 'y':**

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

**We know:**

*  *c + w = 20* (The total number of animals is 20)

**Now we can use a system of equations to solve for *c*:**

1. **Solve for *w* in the first equation:**
   *w = 20 - c*
