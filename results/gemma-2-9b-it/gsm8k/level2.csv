* Let Lylah's original salary be represented by ""x"".
* Adrien's original salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so it was 1.30x.

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**

* Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago ($40,000).
* Increase amount: 40/100 * $40,000 = $16,000
* Adrien's salary four years later: $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**

* We don't know the exact percentage increase for Lylah, but we know it happened simultaneously with Adrien's.  We'll assume it was a proportional increase.

**4.  Find the ratio of Adrien's salary increases to Lylah's salary increases:**

*  Adrien's increase was 40% of his original salary.
*  Let Lylah's increase be represented by ""y"".  We need to find the ratio of 40% of $40,000 to y.

**5.  Set up a proportion:**

*  Since the increases happened simultaneously, the ratio of their salary increases should be proportional to their original salaries.
*  (40/100) * $40,000 / y = 1.30x / x 

**6. Solve for y (Lylah's percentage increase):**

* Simplify the proportion and solve for y. This will give you Lylah's percentage increase.

**1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

* There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a standard die (4, 5, 6).
* There are 6 total possible outcomes.
* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

**2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

*  Possible even numbers: 2, 4, 6 (3)
*  Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll: 3/6 = 1/2
*  Probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (given that the first was even): 3/6 = 1/2
*  Probability of both events happening: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

**3.  Difference in probability:**

*  0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

**4.  Express as a percentage:**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**
* **David found half of Bodhi's amount, so David found B/2 insects.**
* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects.**

* **The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43**

**Now let's solve for B:**

* **Combine like terms: B + B + 7 = 43**
* **Simplify: 2B + 7 = 43**
* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36**
* **Divide both sides by 2: B = 18**

**Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find how many Lily found:**

* **Lily found (B/2) + 7 = (18/2) + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects**

"Here's how to solve this optimization problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' be the number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood.
* Let 'y' be the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

**2. Set up the Constraints:**

* **Cost Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24  (The total cost of wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Stick Constraint:** 200x + 400y ≥  (We want to maximize the number of sticks)

**3.  Objective Function:**

* We want to maximize the number of sticks:  Maximize 200x + 400y

**4. Solve the Linear Programming Problem:**

This is a classic linear programming problem. You can solve it graphically or using a solver.  

* **Graphical Method:**
    * Plot the cost constraint and the stick constraint on a graph.
    * The feasible region (where both constraints are satisfied) will be a polygon.
    * Find the corner points of the feasible region.
    * Evaluate the objective function (200x + 400y) at each corner point.
    * The corner point that yields the highest value for the objective function is the optimal solution.

* **Solver:**
    * Use a linear programming solver (many are available online or in software packages) to input the constraints and objective function. The solver will directly give you the optimal solution.

**5.  Interpret the Solution:**

The solution will tell you the number of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood to buy to maximize the number of popsicle sticks while staying within the budget.

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers: 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers
* Since each large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of large stickers traded for large buttons**

* Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers: 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers
* She gets 20 large stickers worth of large buttons.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of large stickers traded for small buttons**

* Lorraine traded 20 large stickers for large buttons, leaving 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.
* She trades these for small buttons: 20 large stickers * 3 small stickers/large sticker = 60 small stickers

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of small buttons**

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).**

* **Fragrance:** Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses 'x' ounces of fragrance.

* **Salt:** She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so let's call this amount 'y' ounces.

* **Oil:** She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2*y ounces of oil.

* **Total:** The total weight of all the ingredients must equal 10 ounces: x + x + y + y + 2y = 10

**Simplify the equation:**

2x + 4y = 10

**We need to find the value of 'y' (salt) to determine the amount of oil (2y).**  Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to solve for both 'x' and 'y' uniquely.  There are multiple combinations of zest and salt that could work.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let:**

*  F = the number of books Fawn has
*  A = the number of books Anne has
*  S = the number of books Sofie has

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
*  S = A + 25   (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
*  A = F - 12   (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

**Now we can use substitution to solve for F:**

1. **Substitute** the value of A from the second equation into the third equation:
   S = (F - 12) + 25
   S = F + 13

2. **Substitute** the values of S and A from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

3. **Simplify and solve for F:**
   3F + 1 = 85
   3F = 84
   F = 28


**Answer:** Fawn has 28 books.

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

**Let:**

*  Peter's age = P
*  Paul's age = Pa
*  John's age = J

**From the given information, we can set up the following equations:**

*  P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age is 100)
*  Pa = J + 10  (Paul is 10 years older than John)
*  P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

**Now we can solve for Peter's age (P):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** both the second equation (Pa = J + 10) and the modified third equation (P = 2J + 10) into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J back into the equation for P:**
   P = 2J + 10
   P = 2(20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50


**Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let:**

*  *A* = the number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  *S* = the number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  *W* = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  *A + S + W = 339*  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  *A = S + 5*  (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  *S = 4W - 13* (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the values of *A* and *S* from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   *(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339*

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   *2S + 4W - 8 = 339*

3. **Solve for W** in terms of S using the third equation:
   *W = (S + 13) / 4*

4. **Substitute** this value of *W* back into the simplified equation from step 2:
   *2S + 4[(S + 13) / 4] - 8 = 339*

5. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   *2S + S + 13 - 8 = 339*
   *3S + 5 = 339*
   *3S = 334*
   *S = 111.33*

**Understanding Exponential Decay**

Exponential decay means the value decreases by a fixed percentage each year.  We can use the following formula:

*  Future Value = Present Value * (1 - Decay Rate) ^ Number of Years

**Applying the Formula**

* Present Value = $20000
* Decay Rate = 21% = 0.21
* Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Future Value = $20000 * (1 - 0.21) ^ 3
Future Value = $20000 * (0.79) ^ 3
Future Value = $20000 * 0.4913

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7' centimeters.**

* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters.**

* **The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters:**  y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

**Now, let's solve for 'y':**

1.  y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2.  6y - 35 = 37
3.  6y = 72
4.  y = 12

**Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (y = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:**

*  Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, so that's 5s - 4.

*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

**Solve for *c* (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve the first equation for *w*:** 
   *w = 20 - c*

2. **Substitute this value of *w* into the second equation:**
