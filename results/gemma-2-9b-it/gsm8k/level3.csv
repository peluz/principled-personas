**Set up the equations:**

*  *g + s = 110*  (The total number of coins is 110)

* Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his previous salary of $40,000.
* Increase amount: 40/100 * $40,000 = $16,000
* Adrien's salary four years later: $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**

* We don't know the exact percentage increase for Lylah, but we know Adrien's salary is now 40% higher than his previous salary.  
* Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased proportionally.

**4.  Find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**

* Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
* We need more information about Lylah's salary increase to calculate the total. 


**Without knowing the specific percentage increase for Lylah's salary, we cannot determine the final numerical answer.**

* Let 'o' represent the cost of one orange.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

*  w = 3p  (A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs)
*  o = w - 5 (An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon)
*  Total cost = (4w) + (20p) + (10o) 

**3. Substitute and Solve:**

* Since we know p = $15, substitute that into the equations:
    * w = 3 * $15 = $45
    * o = $45 - 5 = $40
* Now, plug the values of w and o into the total cost equation:

"Here's how to calculate the price of the marbles after 36 months:

**1. Calculate the price increase:**

* 20% of $20 = $4

**2.  Calculate the price after the first two months:**

* $20 + $4 = $24

**3.  Repeat the process for each two-month period:**

* After 4 months: $24 + (20% of $24) = $28.80
* After 6 months: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $34.56
* ... and so on

**4.  Continue until you reach 36 months.**

This can be tedious to calculate manually.  It's easier to use a formula or a financial calculator.  

**Using a formula:**

The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:

* P = $20
* r = 0.20 (20% as a decimal)
* n = 6 (compounded every two months)
* t = 3 years (36 months / 12 months per year)

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = 20 (1 + 0.20/6)^(6*3) 
A = 20 (1 + 0.0333)^18
A ≈ $48.87



**Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $48.87 after 36 months.**

* **Cost Equation:** Cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5
* **Total Cost:** Total cost = $5x 
* **Revenue Equation:** Revenue per gallon = $0.50 (price per glass) * 20 (glasses per gallon) = $10
* **Total Revenue:** Total revenue = $10x
* **Profit Equation:** Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
* **Given:** Profit = $25

**3. Solve for x (number of gallons):**

* $25 = $10x - $5x
* $25 = $5x
* x = 5 gallons

**4. Calculate Total Cost:**

* Total cost = $5x = $5 * 5 = $25

* Jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.

**2.  Set up variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the original price of the jogger jeans.
* The tattered jeans were on sale for $28, which is (1 - 1/3) * original price of tattered jeans.

**3.  Write an equation for the total savings:**

* $6 = (2/3) * (original price of tattered jeans - $28) + (1/3) * (x - $22)

**4.  Solve for the original price of the tattered jeans:**

* Since we know the tattered jeans were on sale for $28, we can substitute that into the equation:
* $6 = (2/3) * (original price of tattered jeans - $28) + (1/3) * (x - $22)
* $6 = (2/3) * ($28 - original price of tattered jeans) + (1/3) * (x - $22)

This forms a geometric sequence.  To find the total cost, we need to sum this sequence. There's a formula for that:

**Sum of a geometric series = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)**

Where:

* a = the first term ($100,000)
* r = the common ratio (1.50)
* n = the number of terms (45 months of increased funding + 5 initial months = 50 months)

* Better player plays 240 minutes / 30 minutes/game = 8 games.

**5. Calculate the total cost:**

* Jack spends 12 games * $0.25/game = $3.00
* Worse players each spend 24 games * $0.25/game = $6.00
* Better player spends 8 games * $0.25/game = $2.00

**6. Calculate the total cost for all players:**

* Total cost is $3.00 + ($6.00 * 2) + $2.00 = $3.00 + $12.00 + $2.00 = $17.00

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let:**

*  x = ounces of citrus zest 
*  x = ounces of fragrance (since she uses the same amount of each)
*  y = ounces of salt
*  y = ounces of sugar (since she uses the same amount of each)
*  2y = ounces of oil (twice the amount of salt)

**Set up the equation:**

The total weight of all the ingredients must equal 10 ounces:

x + x + y + y + 2y = 10

**Simplify the equation:**

2x + 4y = 10

**Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**

Let's solve for x:

2x = 10 - 4y
x = 5 - 2y

**Substitute to find the amount of oil:**

Since oil = 2y, we can substitute this into our equation:

oil = 2y 

**We need more information to find a numerical answer.**  We have two variables (x and y) and only one equation.  We need another equation to solve for both x and y. 


Let me know if you have any other information about the recipe!

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  *y = b - 3*  (You are three years younger than your brother)

*  *m = 3b - 1* (Mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let:**
    * Peter's age = P
    * Paul's age = Pa
    * John's age = J

* **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
    * P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age is 100)
    * Pa = J + 10       (Paul is 10 years older than John)
    * P = Pa + J        (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for P (Peter's age):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** both the second equation (Pa = J + 10) and the modified third equation (P = 2J + 10) into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J back into the equation for P:**
   P = 2(20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

Here's what we know:

* **A + S + W = 339** (Together they caught 339 Pokemon)
* **A = S + 5** (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* **S = 4W - 13** (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can use substitution to solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):

1. **Substitute** the value of A from the second equation into the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W = 334

4. **Simplify** and solve for W:
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360

    *  We know d + 5 = 2(b + 5)  (Emil will be twice his brother's age)
    *  We also know d + 5 = 1/2 * (d + 5) (Emil will be half his dad's age)

**Solve the system of equations:**

1. **Simplify the second equation:**
   d + 5 = (1/2)d + 5/2
   (1/2)d = 5/2
   d = 5

2. **Substitute the value of d (5) into the first equation:**
   5 + 5 = 2(b + 5)
   10 = 2b + 10
   0 = 2b
   b = 0

**Find the sum of dad's and brother's current ages:**

* Dad's age (d) = 5

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent Bill's age when he first saw the comet as ""x"".**

* **Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it again three times that age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.**

* **Since Comet Halley orbits every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.**

* **This means Bill's age when he saw it the second time (90) is 75 years more than his age when he saw it the first time (x).**

* **We can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90**

* **Solving for x: x = 90 - 75**

* The power bank had 28% charge at the end.
*  Before the last 3 hours, it was losing 7% per hour.  To find the charge before that, we need to reverse the 7% loss for 3 hours:
    *  Increase the 28% by 7% for each of the 3 hours: 
        * 28% + 7% = 35%
        * 35% + 7% = 42%

*  This means the power bank had 49% charge 3 hours before the end.

**2. Account for the First 5 Hours:**

* Before the 3 hours of 7% loss, the power bank was losing 9% per hour for 5 hours.
*  Reverse the 9% loss for 5 hours:
    * Decrease the 49% by 9% for each of the 5 hours:

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the price of a BMX bike:** A BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, so it costs $500 / 2 = $250.

2. **Calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:** Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so Marcel sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

3. **Calculate the number of BMX bikes sold:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so Marcel sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

4. **Calculate the number of MTB bikes sold:**  The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes, so Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

5. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   * Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
   * BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
   * MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

6. **Calculate the total earnings:** Marcel earned a total of $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' be Grandma's walking speed on the beach (in miles per minute).

**2.  Calculate Sidewalk Speed:**

* Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2x.

**3.  Set Up Time Equations:**

* Time on the beach = Distance on the beach / Speed on the beach = 2 / x
* Time on the sidewalk = Distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk = 1 / 2x

**4.  Total Time Equation:**

* Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk 
* We know the time on the beach is 40 minutes, so: 40 + (1 / 2x) = Total time

**5.  Solve for Total Time:**

*  Since we know the total distance is 3 miles, we can use the fact that distance = rate * time to find the total time.
*  3 = (2 * x) * (2/x) + (1 * 2x) * (1/2x)
*  3 = 4 + 1

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out how many scoops Gomer ate:**

* Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops: 23 - 5 = 18 scoops

**2.  Set up an equation to represent the potatoes to scoops ratio:**

* Let 'p' represent the number of potatoes.
* It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes (6-3 = 3) to make 1 less than 3 scoops (3-1 = 2) of mashed potatoes.
*  The equation is: 3p = 2

**3. Solve for 'p' (the number of potatoes):**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 3: p = 2/3

**4.  Since you can't have a fraction of a potato, this problem doesn't have a realistic solution.**

* Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2C seashells.
* Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2C + 5 seashells.

**Set up the equation:**

* Total seashells = Carrey's shells + Carlos' shells + Jim's shells
* Total seashells = C + 2C + (2C + 5)

**Solve for the total seashells:**

4. **Youngest son's current age:** John's youngest son was born when he was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *c* represent the number of chickens
*  *w* represent the number of cows

**Set up the equations:**

* **Equation 1 (Total animals):** c + w = 20 
* **Equation 2 (Total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**Solve for *c* (number of chickens):**

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for *w*:**  w = 20 - c
2. **Substitute this value of *w* into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for *c*:** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5


**Answer:** There are **5** chickens.
