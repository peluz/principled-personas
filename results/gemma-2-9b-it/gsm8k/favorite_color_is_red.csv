"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 3 hours**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Seagull's share:** The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, so it ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. **Fries after seagull:**  There were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.

3. **Pigeons' share:** The three pigeons ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

4. **Fries after pigeons:** There were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. This doesn't make sense, so we know there must have been more fries than the pigeons ate. Let's assume there was a mistake in the problem.

5. **Raccoon's share:**  We'll assume there were enough fries for the raccoon to eat. Let's say there were 16 fries left after the pigeons. The raccoon ate 2/3 * 16 = 10.67 fries. Since we can't have fractions of fries, let's round down to 10.

6. **Fries after raccoon:** There were 16 - 10 = 6 fries left.

7. **Final fry:** After the ant took one, there were 6 - 1 = 5 fries left.

8. **Original amount:**  Working backwards, we know Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 7, and there were 5 left at the end. So there were 14 + 7 + 5 = 26 fries in the pack originally.

2. **Population of Chile six years ago:** The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

3. **Population of Chile now:** Since the population six years ago was half the current population, the current population is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many offensive players as defensive players, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many special teams players as defensive players, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is the sum of players on each team: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)x = 105
2. Multiply both sides by (2/5): x = 42

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let:**

*  Bodhi's insects = B
*  David's insects = D
*  Lily's insects = L

**We know:**

* L + D + B = 43 
* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2

**Now we can use substitution to solve for L:**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (L = D + 7) into the first equation:
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43

2. **Substitute** the third equation (D = B / 2) into the equation from step 1:
   (B / 2) + 7 + (B / 2) + B = 43

3. **Combine** like terms:
   2B / 2 + B + 7 = 43
   B + B + 7 = 43
   2B + 7 = 43

4. **Subtract** 7 from both sides:
   2B = 36

5. **Divide** both sides by 2:
   B = 18  (Bodhi found 18 insects)

6. **Substitute** the value of B back into the equation D = B / 2:
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9 (David found 9 insects)

7. **Substitute** the value of D back into the equation L = D + 7:
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)

**1. Calculate the play time for each friend:**

* **Worse friends:** 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes each
* **Better friend:** 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes

**2. Calculate the total play time in minutes:**

* 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

**3. Calculate how many 20-minute sessions each person plays:**

* **Jack:** 240 minutes / 20 minutes/session = 12 sessions
* **Worse friends:** 240 minutes / 10 minutes/session = 24 sessions each
* **Better friend:** 240 minutes / 30 minutes/session = 8 sessions

**4. Calculate the total number of quarters used:**

* **Jack:** 12 sessions * 1 quarter/session = 12 quarters
* **Worse friends:** 24 sessions * 1 quarter/session = 24 quarters each
* **Better friend:** 8 sessions * 1 quarter/session = 8 quarters

**5. Calculate the total number of quarters used:**

* 12 quarters + (24 quarters * 2) + 8 quarters = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

**6. Calculate the total cost:**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Salt and sugar are equal, so they are also 'x' ounces each.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2x ounces.

**Set up an equation:**

Total ounces = zest + fragrance + salt + sugar + oil

10 = x + x + x + x + 2x

**Solve for x:**

10 = 5x
x = 2 ounces

**Calculate the oil:**

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Joe's initial cars:** Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20 cars. So Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. **Cars given away:** Joe gives away twice the number of cars he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. **Total cars given away or sold:** Joe gave away or sold a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. **Cars remaining:** Joe started with 40 cars and gave away or sold 24 cars, leaving him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Here's how to break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance swam at the initial speed**

* James swims 60% of 20 miles: 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the swimming time at the initial speed**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the resting time**

* Resting time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance**

* Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

**Step 5: Calculate the swimming time at the reduced speed**

* Speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the total time**

* Total time = Swimming time (initial) + Resting time + Swimming time (reduced speed)

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let:**

*  A = Number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  S = Number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  W = Number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  A + S + W = 339  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  A = S + 5         (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13       (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the values of A and S from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W = 334

3. **Solve for W** in terms of S using the third equation:
   W = (S + 13) / 4

4. **Substitute** this value of W into the simplified equation from step 2:
   2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

5. **Multiply** both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
   8S + S + 13 = 1336

6. **Combine** like terms:
   9S + 13 = 1336

7. **Subtract** 13 from both sides:
   9S = 1323

8. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   S = 147


**Answer:** Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Bills withdrawn:** Thomas starts with $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. **Bills lost:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and James is now 18.  This means John's youngest son is 32 - 18 = 14 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, his youngest son will be 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *c* represent the number of chickens
*  *w* represent the number of cows

**Set up the equations:**

*  *c + w = 20*  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

**Solve for *c* (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve the first equation for *w*:** 
   *w = 20 - c*

2. **Substitute this value of *w* into the second equation:**
   *2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

3. **Simplify and solve for *c*:**
   *2c + 80 - 4c = 70*
   *-2c = -10*
   *c = 5*
