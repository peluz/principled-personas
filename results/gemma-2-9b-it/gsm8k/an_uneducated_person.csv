"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5 to 6.  That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

We need to figure out how many popsicles are in one ""part"" of that ratio.  To do that, we add up the parts: 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Since they have 165 popsicles total, each part is worth 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

* **Calculate how much George spent:** He started with $5 and had $0.05 left, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.
* **Calculate the cost of the chips:** 3 bags of chips cost 3 * $0.40 = $1.20.
* **Calculate how much money was spent on candy bars:** George spent $4.95 total and $1.20 on chips, so he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.
* **Calculate the number of candy bars:** Each candy bar costs $0.75, so he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions times 2, so he needs 4 pounds of onions.

That costs 4 pounds times $2.00 a pound, which is $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock at $2.00 a box, so that costs 2 times $2.00, which is $4.00.

The total cost of the soup is $8.00 plus $4.00, which is $12.00.

"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  That means if you lined up all the little squares that make up the floor, they'd add up to 360.

And his room is 3 yards long.  Now, there are 3 feet in every yard, so his room is 3 times 3, which is 9 feet long.

To find the perimeter, we need to add up all the sides.  We know one side is 9 feet.  Since it's a rectangle, the other side is the same length.  So that's 9 feet plus 9 feet, which is 18 feet.

Then we add up the other two sides, which are also the same length.  That's another 18 feet.

So, the perimeter is 18 feet plus 18 feet, which is 36 feet.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Oven heating:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so the total increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

2. **Temperature after baking:**  The house starts at 40 degrees and increases by 15 degrees, so the temperature is now 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. **Cooling from the window:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half of 10 minutes. So the house cools down by 2 * 0.5 = 1 degree.

4. **Final temperature:** The house cools by 1 degree from the 55 degrees, resulting in a final temperature of 55 - 1 = 54 degrees.

To find when the costs are equal, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

Now, let's solve for the number of guests:

$200 = $20 * number of guests
number of guests = $200 / $20
number of guests = 10

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use letters:**

    * Let 'B' be the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * Let 'D' be the number of insects David found.
    * Let 'L' be the number of insects Lily found.

* **Write down what we know:**

    * L + D + B = 43  (They found a total of 43 insects)
    * L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    * D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Now we can use these clues to solve for L (how many insects Lily found):**

    1. **Since we know D = B / 2, let's substitute that into the second clue:**  L = (B / 2) + 7

    2. **Now we have two clues with two unknowns (L and B). Let's substitute the first clue into these:**
       *  (B / 2) + 7 + (B / 2) + B = 43

    3. **Simplify the equation:**
       * B + B + B = 43 - 7
       * 3B = 36

    4. **Solve for B:**
       * B = 36 / 3
       * B = 12

    5. **Now that we know B (Bodhi found 12 insects), we can find D (David found half of Bodhi's):**
       * D = 12 / 2
       * D = 6

    6. **Finally, we can find L (Lily found 7 more than David):**
       * L = 6 + 7
       * L = 13

Let's say one triplet is 5 years old. That means the twin older than them is 12 (5 + 7).

Now we have:

* Twin 1: 12
* Twin 2:  We don't know yet
* Triplet 1: 5
* Triplet 2: We don't know yet
* Triplet 3: We don't know yet

The total age so far is 12 + 5 = 17.  We need to find the ages of the other three kids to reach 44.

Let's keep guessing and checking until we find a combination that works!

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use letters:**

    * Let 'P' be the number of cards PJ has.
    * Let 'S' be the number of cards Smendrick has.
    * Let 'B' be the number of cards Becca has.

* **Write down what we know:**

    * B + S + P = 341  (The total number of cards)
    * B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)
    * S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has)

* **Now we can use these clues to solve for B (the number of cards Becca has):**

    1. **Substitute** the second and third clues into the first clue:
       (S + 12) + S + 3P = 341

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       2S + 3P + 12 = 341

    3. **Since S = 3P, substitute '3P' for 'S':**
       2(3P) + 3P + 12 = 341

    4. **Simplify again:**
       6P + 3P + 12 = 341
       9P + 12 = 341

    5. **Subtract 12 from both sides:**
       9P = 329

    6. **Divide both sides by 9:**
       P = 36.56 (approximately)

    7. **Since we can't have parts of cards, we'll round P to 36.**

    8. **Now that we know P, we can find S:**
       S = 3P = 3 * 36 = 108

    9. **Finally, find B:**
       B = S + 12 = 108 + 12 = 120

* **Write down the information as equations:**

    *  Y = B - 3  (You are 3 years younger than your brother)
    *  Y = S + 2  (You are 2 years older than your sister)
    *  Mom's age = 3B - 1
    *  Y + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 (The sum of all ages is 87)

* **Now we can use these equations to solve for Y (your age):**

    Since we have multiple equations, we can use substitution to solve for one variable at a time. 

    1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the fourth equation:
       (B - 3) + B + (B - 3) + (3B - 1) = 87

    2. **Simplify** the equation:

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use letters:**

    * Let 'F' be the number of books Fawn has.
    * Let 'A' be the number of books Anne has.
    * Let 'S' be the number of books Sofie has.

* **Write down what we know:**

    * S + A + F = 85  (They have a total of 85 books)
    * S = A + 25   (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
    * A = F - 12   (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

* **Now we can use these clues to solve for F (the number of books Fawn has):**

    1. **Substitute** the second and third clues into the first clue:
       (A + 25) + A + F = 85

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       2A + F + 25 = 85

    3. **Substitute** the third clue (A = F - 12) into the equation:
       2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

    4. **Simplify and solve for F:**
       2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
       3F + 1 = 85
       3F = 84
       F = 28

"Let's break this down:

* **Let John's age be ""J""**

* **Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is ""J + 10""**

* **Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, so Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10""**

* **The total age of all three is 100: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100**

Now we can solve for J:

* **Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100**
* **Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80**
* **Divide both sides by 4: J = 20**

Now that we know John's age (J = 20), we can find Peter's age:

* **Peter's age is 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50**

2. **Let Wilfred's age be represented by ""w"".**

3. **Set up an equation for the average age:** (7 + w + Helene's age) / 4 = Helene's age / 2

4. **Since Helene is twice the average age, we can rewrite the equation:** (7 + w + Helene's age) / 4 = Helene's age / 2

5. **We know the total age is 20, so:** 7 + w + Helene's age = 20

6. **Solve for Helene's age:** Helene's age = 13 - w

7. **Substitute Helene's age back into the equation from step 4:** (7 + w + (13 - w)) / 4 = (13 - w) / 2

8. **Simplify and solve for w:** (20) / 4 = (13 - w) / 2  -->  5 = (13 - w) / 2  -->  10 = 13 - w  -->  w = 3

"Okay, so there are 2 grown-ups and 4 kids.  

The grown-ups get slices twice as big as the kids'.  That means if a kid gets 1 piece, a grown-up gets 2 pieces.

So, the grown-ups have 2 + 2 = 4 pieces.

And the kids have 4 pieces.

That means the grown-ups have 4 out of 8 total pieces.

To find the percentage, we do 4 divided by 8, which is 0.5.

* **Let's use letters:**
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
    *  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) cm long.

* **Add up the lengths:**
    *  y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Simplify and solve for 'y':**
    *  y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

"Let's think about this:

*  The longer piece is bigger, and it's 4 times bigger than the smaller piece.
*  Together, the two pieces make the whole board, which is 40 feet long.

We can use words to help us figure this out:

*  Let's say the shorter piece is ""x"" feet long.
*  The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it's ""4x"" feet long.

Now we know:

*  x (shorter piece) + 4x (longer piece) = 40 feet (the whole board)

Let's combine the ""x""s:

*  5x = 40 feet

To find out how long one ""x"" is, we divide both sides by 5:

*  x = 8 feet

Now we know the shorter piece is 8 feet long.  

The longer piece is 4 times that, so it's:

*  4 * 8 = 32 feet
