"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
* Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
* Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
*  D = B / 2 (David found half of Bodhi's)
*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)

**Solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (D = B/2) into the third equation: 
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the second and modified third equations into the first equation:
   (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

3. **Combine** like terms:
   2B/2 + B + 7 = 43
   B + B + 7 = 43
   2B + 7 = 43

4. **Subtract** 7 from both sides:
   2B = 36

5. **Divide** both sides by 2:
   B = 18  (Bodhi found 18 insects)

6. **Substitute** the value of B back into the equation D = B/2:
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9 (David found 9 insects)

7. **Substitute** the value of D back into the equation L = D + 7:
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.
*  Let 'tw' represent the age of one twin.

**Set up the equations:**

*  We know tw = t + 7 (The twin is 7 years older than the triplet)
*  We also know tw + tw + t + t + t = 44 (The combined ages of all five are 44)

**Solve for 't':**

* Simplify the second equation: 2tw + 3t = 44

**Substitute 't + 7' for 'tw' in the simplified equation:**

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers: 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers
* Each large button requires 3 small stickers: 27 small stickers / 3 = 9 large buttons

**Step 2: Calculate the number of large stickers traded for large buttons**

* Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers: 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers

**Step 3: Calculate the number of small stickers received from trading large stickers**

* Each large button is worth 3 small stickers: 20 large stickers * 3 small stickers/large sticker = 60 small stickers

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of buttons**

* Lorraine now has 9 large buttons (from step 1) + 20 large stickers (from step 2) = 29 large buttons
* Lorraine also has 60 small stickers (from step 3)

**Step 5: Convert remaining large stickers to buttons**

    * S = A + 25   (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
    * A = F - 12    (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

* **Solve for F (the number of books Fawn has):**

    1. **Substitute** the values of S and A from the second and third equations into the first equation:
       (A + 25) + A + F = 85

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       2A + F + 25 = 85

    3. **Substitute** the value of A from the third equation (A = F - 12) into the simplified equation:
       2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

    4. **Solve for F:**
       2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
       3F + 1 = 85
       3F = 84
       F = 28

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let:**

*  *A* = the number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  *S* = the number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  *W* = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  *A + S + W = 339*  (Total Pokemon caught)
*  *A = S + 5*  (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  *S = 4W - 13* (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

**Solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the values of *A* and *S* from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   *(S + 5) + S + W = 339*

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   *2S + W = 334*

3. **Solve for W** in terms of S using the third equation:
   *W = (S + 13) / 4*

4. **Substitute** this value of *W* into the simplified equation from step 2:
   *2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334*

5. **Multiply** both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
   *8S + S + 13 = 1336*

6. **Combine** like terms:
   *9S + 13 = 1336*

7. **Subtract** 13 from both sides:
   *9S = 1323*

8. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   *S = 147*

* **Let's represent Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as ""x"".**

* **Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.**
* **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.**

* **Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.**

* **Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time (90) minus the time between sightings (75) equals his age when he saw it for the first time (x): 90 - 75 = x**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) cm long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm, so:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2. 6y - 35 = 37
3. 6y = 72
4. y = 12 

**Find the length of the red rope:**

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *c* represent the number of chickens
*  *w* represent the number of cows

**Set up the equations:**

*  *c + w = 20*  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  *2c + 4w = 70* (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

**Solve for *c* (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. **Solve the first equation for *w*:** 
   *w = 20 - c*

2. **Substitute this value of *w* into the second equation:**
   *2c + 4(20 - c) = 70*

3. **Simplify and solve for *c*:**
