* John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he travels 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

**Step 2: Distance traveled in the first 2 hours**

* He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he doesn't travel any distance during this time.

**Step 3: Distance traveled in the next half-hour**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Swim:** James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he swims 40 minutes * 0.10 = 4 minutes faster.  His swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.
* **Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 60 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.
* **Jon's total time:** Jon's total time is 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes.
* **James's total time:** Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Figure out how many miles the horse runs:**
   *  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour.
   *  The horse runs 32 miles in an hour, so in 30 minutes it runs 32 / 2 = 16 miles.

2. **Calculate how much hay the horse eats:**
   * The horse eats 1/2 a bale of hay for every mile, so it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

3. **Find the total cost of the hay:**
   * Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

4. **Calculate how much money Michael has:**
   * Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

5. **Determine Michael's change:**
   * Michael has $30 and the hay costs $24, so his change is $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's think about this:

*  The house is three times more expensive than the lot.
*  That means the lot is a smaller part of the total cost.

If we split the $120,000 into 4 equal parts, the house would be 3 of those parts and the lot would be 1 part.

*  One part is $120,000 / 4 = $30,000

* **Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs.**
* **Let's use letters:**
    *  Let 's' be the number of sheep
    *  Let 'g' be the number of geese

* **We know:**
    *  s + g = 20 (total heads)
    *  4s + 2g = 70 (total legs)

* **Now we need to solve for 's' (the number of sheep).**  We can use a little bit of guessing and checking, or we can use a trick:

    *  Since each sheep has 2 more legs than a goose, let's think about how many geese would make the legs add up to 70. If we had 10 geese (10 x 2 = 20 legs), we'd be missing 50 legs.  

    *  That means we need 12.5 sheep to make up the rest of the legs (50 legs / 4 legs per sheep = 12.5 sheep).

    *  Since we can't have half a sheep, let's try a little less.  

    *  If we have 12 sheep, that's 48 legs (12 x 4 = 48).

    *  That leaves us needing 2 more legs, which means we need 1 goose (1 x 2 = 2 legs).

*  The total votes are 'x' + '2x' = 33

*  Combining like terms, we get '3x' = 33
*  To find 'x', we divide both sides by 3: 'x' = 11

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Small shirts:** Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, so 11 students * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.
* **Medium shirts:** Four less than the number of small shirts need medium shirts, so 22 students - 4 students = 18 students need medium shirts.
* **Large shirts:** Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts, so 18 students / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.
* **Extra-large shirts:** Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 students + 6 students = 15 students need extra-large shirts.
* **Total shirts:** Add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 40 * 0.20 = 8 cars.
* **Cars given away:** Joe gives away twice the number he sold, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Total cars gone:** Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars, for a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.
* **Cars remaining:** Joe started with 40 cars and lost 24, so he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use letters to represent the number of cards:**

    * Let 'P' be the number of cards PJ has.
    * Let 'S' be the number of cards Smendrick has.
    * Let 'B' be the number of cards Becca has.

* **Write down the information we know as equations:**

    * B + S + P = 341  (The total number of cards)
    * B = S + 12  (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)
    * S = 3P  (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has)

* **Now we can use these equations to find out how many cards Becca has:**

    1. **Substitute** the value of 'S' from the third equation into the second equation: B = (3P) + 12
    2. **Substitute** the values of 'B' and 'S' from the second and third equations into the first equation: (3P + 12) + (3P) + P = 341
    3. **Simplify** the equation: 7P + 12 = 341
    4. **Subtract** 12 from both sides: 7P = 329
    5. **Divide** both sides by 7: P = 47  (This means PJ has 47 cards)
    6. **Substitute** the value of 'P' back into the equation S = 3P to find Smendrick's cards: S = 3 * 47 = 141
    7. **Substitute** the value of 'S' back into the equation B = S + 12 to find Becca's cards: B = 141 + 12 = 153


Becca has 153 cards."

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Find the total money Sarah will make.** 
   She sells the rope for $2 per meter and it's 20 meters long, so she'll make 2 * 20 = $40.

* **Step 2: Find how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy.**
   The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she has $40, so she can buy $40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters of new rope.  Since she can't buy parts of meters, she can buy 26 meters.

* **Step 3: Find the total cost of the new rope.**
   The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and she's buying 26 meters, so it will cost 1.5 * 26 = $39.

* **Step 4: Find how much money Sarah has left over.**
   She made $40 and spent $39, so she has $40 - $39 = $1 left over.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**
   -  If the final charge was 28%, and it lost 45%, it must have had 28 + 45 = 73% charge before the last 3 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the initial charge:**
   -  The power bank had 73% charge before the last 3 hours and lost 21%, so it started with 73 + 21 = 94% charge.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Find the total energy needed for 2300 people:**

   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy, we need to figure out how many bottles cover 100%.  That's 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

   So, 2300 people need 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

* **Step 2: Find the difference:**

   Hortex produces 4200 bottles a day, and they need 11500 bottles.  

   The difference is 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

* **The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.**

* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.**

* **All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long:**  y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Now we can solve for 'y':**
    * y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    * 6y - 35 = 37
    * 6y = 72
    * y = 12

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use letters:**

   * Let Wendy's current age be ""W""
   * Let Colin's current age be ""C""

* **Write down what we know as equations:**

   *  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  W = 5(C + 7) 
   *  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": C + 25 = (1/3)W

* **Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

   1.  We can rearrange the first equation to solve for W:  W = 5C + 35
   2.  Substitute this value of W into the second equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)
   3.  Simplify and solve for C: C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3
                                    (3/3)C + 75/3 = (5/3)C + 35/3
                                    75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)C - (3/3)C
